Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We review limitations of the traditional paradigm for cultural research and propose an alternative framework, polyculturalism. Polyculturalism assumes that individuals' relationships to cultures are not categorical but rather are partial and plural; it also assumes that cultural traditions are not independent, sui generis lineages but rather are interacting systems. Individuals take influences from multiple cultures and thereby become conduits through which cultures can affect each other. Past literatures on the influence of multiple cultural identities and cultural knowledge legacies can be better understood within a polyculturalist rubric. Likewise, the concept elucidates how cultures are changed by contact with other cultures, enabling richer psychological theories of intercultural influence. Different scientific paradigms about culture imply different ideologies and policies; polyculturalism's implied policy of interculturalism provides a valuable complement to the traditional policy frames of multiculturalism and colorblindness.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Fundamental features of mutualisms are solutions to conflict. The mutualism between fungus-gardening ants and their fungi is characterized by pronounced evolutionary ant-fungus fidelity. Ant-fungus fidelity is thought to be controlled by the fungus, which secretes somatic incompatibility compounds that suppress incompatible fungal strains that may invade gardens. Accordingly, the ants are thought to perceive incompatibilities and then reject invading cultivars. During cultivar-switch experiments, we discovered that if switched colonies of the ant Trachymyrmex septentrionalis are successful in retaining a minute fragment of their original garden, the ants will gradually co-cultivate the novel and the original fungus strains in a chimeric (polycultural) garden; this chimeric garden will revert after 1-2 weeks completely to a monoculture of the original fungal strain. Experimental examination of worker preference suggests that symbiont rejection behavior seems to be an innate response toward foreign fungi rather than mediated solely by incompatibility compounds secreted by the fungus. These observations suggest that the fungal strain cultivated by a colony imprints the attending ants, and this imprinting modifies ant behavior so that the ants prefer their original cultivar even when experimentally forced to grow a foreign cultivar for several weeks. Fungal monocultures and ant-fungus fidelities in this symbiosis therefore seem to be reinforced by factors intrinsic to both the ants and the fungi.

Its purpose is to explore the utility of regarding groups with shared mindscapes as cultures in themselves, and to investigate how the recognition of that congruence can benefit the study of social interaction. The concept of mindscapes represents different logical structures which involve elements of perception, cognition, cogitation, conceptualization, behavior, design, planning, and decision making. The study asks three research questions: 1. ""How have prominent social scientists conceptualized culture?"" 2. ""In what ways can shared mindscapes be considered congruent with the concept of culture?"" 3. ""In what ways can the concept of mindscapes as cultures be integrated with the principles of intercultural communication?"" An enriched cultural orientation is proposed to expand traditional conceptualizations, giving consideration to questions of meaning, power, multiple identities, and the social construction of reality; culture as epistemology and epistemology as culture emerges as a new paradigm. Finally, principles of intercultural competence are applied to crossmindscape interactions, emphasizing value orientations, expectations, and attributions, and proposing the discovery and development of cross-cultural/cross-scapal translators. The findings suggest that cognitive complexity, in place of a cognitively simple outlook, can alleviate the tendency to ethnocentric evaluations and judgments, and that conflict at all social levels holds potential for illumination if treated mindfully and as cases of intercultural contact.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In this article, we examine the affordances of polylingual and polycultural learning ecologies in expanding the linguistic repertoires of children, particularly young Dual Language Learners. In contrast to settings that promote the development of English and academic language at the expense of maintaining and developing home language, we argue that the social organization of learning should privilege participation in dynamic, hybrid literacy practices. Children are often more likely to experiment with English and academic genres, while also taking on powerful identities as learners and language users, when formal and informal modes of communication are leveraged, multimodality and language-crossing encouraged and the use of both home and academic vernaculars promoted within a context that values social relationships and the playful imagination. We argue that children's literacy practices develop in particular social and 'located' relationships, and we examine one such after-school setting designed with these principles in mind, the long-standing UC Links/Las Redes partnership, where home languages and intercultural experiences are unmarked and necessarily integral to participating in the shared practices of the community. We highlight the affordance of one common practice of the community, childrens communication with the mythical cyber wizard, El Maga (sic), and the ways this practice strategically draws on students full linguistic toolkits in order to invite them to integrate modes and genres of communication that challenge the divide between everyday and school-based literacies, stretching children beyond their current levels of literacy development.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Scholars have long explored the colorblind and multicultural ideological approaches to improving intergroup attitudes and relations. Polyculturalism, a newly studied ideological approach, focuses on the past and current interactions and connections among different racial and ethnic groups. Drawing on cross-disciplinary work, we critically examine the various forms that each of these ideological approaches has taken across studies, and their implications for intergroup attitudes and relations among racially and ethnically diverse children, adolescents, and adults. Although each ideological approach has been examined in several ways (often combining different forms of each approach), there is sufficient comparative work to draw some conclusions. We propose that a combined ideological approach be implemented in educational settings that maximizes the strengths and positive intergroup consequences of colorblindness, multiculturalism, and polyculturalism, while minimizes the weaknesses and negative intergroup consequences of each approach.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(create) This chapter discusses hypocrisy in politics from variety of perspectives, including that of Andrew Samuels, who proposes a dialogue of diversities-in addition to Arendt's harmonious co-existence of the different, and Baumann's postulated universalism-a polycultural society that embraces differences and the capacity to communicate and reach mutual understanding, 'a communion of meanings'. The problem posed by political hypocrisy is less that of knowing whether it would be licit to use subterfuges to affirm power, particularly if the objective is some common good. The relevant question is the manipulation that stifles the conscience and the iatrogenics inherent to this procedure: loss of the capacity of moral judgment, the ethical discernment that leads us to the discovery of possible answers to our dilemmas and challenges. Recognizing the personalities that rely on manipulation, whether conscious or narcissistic or else the result of some other personality disorder, would be an instrument against alienation and accommodation, against the skidding of these hyper-modern times on the deafening and bewildering race-track to the void.

Two small groups of five participants were asked to coconstruct, independent from each other, a visual map depicting a mutually agreed-upon story of a common experience, and then present their map to the other group. Group collaboration and post-process discussion were recorded and transcribed, formal and informal assessments were used to address some variables, and process and analysis models, tools, and concepts were applied. Located in the nexus of visual communication and intercultural communication, the study approached the research objectively and subjectively and covered three categories of theories of intercultural communication (W. B. Gudykunst, C. M. Lee, T. Nishida, & N. Ogawa, 2005): social construction and constructivist theories, theories about cultural differences, and theories concerning communication patterns, in particular communication networks. The data demonstrated that groups' communication patterns were projected into the gestalt of the visual maps, and the coconstruction of meaning was not found in the individuals' personal frames, but in the communication pattern between them-not in the elements of the visual map but in the gestalt. The cocreated meaning was confirmed in a self-organized seating constellation that mirrored the hierarchy of the groups to each other and exposed, subconsciously, the roles individuals had played. In an Epilogue to the traditional dissertation chapters, integral theory-in particular D. E. Beck's (n.d.) Spiral Dynamics Integral and K. Wilber's (2005) All Quadrants All Levels-provided the foundation for developing two new models to accommodate the interdependent relationship between the elements of the human core (the Layers of Complexity) and to fully investigate the communication acts through objective and subjective lenses on the individual and collective levels (the Map of Complexity). Data suggested a paradigm shift into polyculturalism with transcultural communication forms, and the potential multipositionality and contextuality of cultural hybrids, leading to the hypothesis that culture has become an available design.

Focusing on three disparate sites of inquiry-queer Filipino American men's subcultural practices; recordings by DJ Qbert and the Invisibl Skratch Piklz; and the creation of Filipino American community-based theatres-taking place in California between the People Power movement and the end of the 20th century, my dissertation examines at the ways in which contemporary Filipino American cultural practices are shaped not only by the historical and intimate violences of U.S. imperialism but are also fueled by a polycultural project of belonging. Operating under and through various forms of martial cultures (War on Drugs, turntable battles, and Ferdinand Marcos' martial rule), these Filipino American performances are always-already collaborative, bringing to the forefront Filipino America's polycultural practices of art- and world-making. The key concepts of intimacy and belonging are mobilized throughout my dissertation as modes of thinking through and troubling strict categories of nationalism promulgated in traditional discussions of race and ethnicity.

Vol.58(5-B), Nov 1997, pp. 2718.",0419-4217,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"This study examined the interrelationships and structure of three multiple reference group identities (race, gender, and sexual) in lesbians of Black-African descent and examined how these identities predicted both Eurocentric and Africentric self-concept. One hundred lesbians of Black-African descent ranging from 18 to 61 years of age who resided predominantly in the San Francisco/Bay Area were recruited through various community, academic, social, and spiritual avenues. Multiple measures were used. The Tennessee Self-Concept Scale measured Eurocentric self-concept; the Social Outlook Scale measured Africentric self-concept. The Racial Identity Attitude Scale, along with its adaptations for gender and sexual identity, measured the multiple reference group identities, and the Multiple Identity Questionnaire, designed by the present researcher, measured the interrelationships among the identities. Although results indicated that the participants' race, gender, and sexual identities were interrelated, their race identity exerted the most influence on the other identities. Results were mixed regarding the structure of the multiple identities. A statistically significant number of participants ranked their identities as equally important, yet of those participants who did rank their identities, almost a third ranked their race identity as most important. In social contexts, participants expressed their race and gender identities more easily than their sexual identity. Specifically, it was easier to express their gender than their sexual identity in a Black social context and easier to express their race than their sexual identity in a female social context. Neither race nor gender identity was perceived to be easier to express in a lesbian social context. None of the identities differentially predicted the Eurocentric self-concept, whereas gender identity accounted for most of the variance in the Africentric self-concept. These findings stress the polycultural, multiple identity issues lesbians of Black-African descent experience. These issues are important for clinicians to understand when working with this population in individual, group, couples, or family therapy. Suggestions for future research include investigating whether the interrelationships and structure of the multiple identities change over time and how these changes affect interpersonal and social functioning.
