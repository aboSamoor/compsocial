Such families, which were associated with the socialist rhetoric of ""brotherhood and unity"" during the Yugoslav period, came under severe pressure during the war, as the populations of entire towns fled ""ethnic cleansing"" and sought safety in territories controlled by their own people. Mixed families and persons continue to represent ""a thorn in the eye"" that troubles nationalism, unsettling national categories and insistently recalling histories of interconnection that bind the peoples of the Balkans despite war and the ravages of communal hatred. This work traces the repercussions of mixing, the challenging experiments with ethno-religious affiliation that face not only the marriage partners, but move through extended kin networks and profoundly influence the lives of children born into the family. Using audio and video recordings made over 12 months in 2011-2012 among 11 families in Sarajevo, the dissertation focuses on everyday family interactions-routines and conversations located in households-as a way of gaining insight into the micro-processes through which persons and identities are constituted as kin relations are enacted. It shows how particular metaphors of kinship are employed to naturalize nationalist xenophobia, and how mixed marriages challenge these claims. Emphasizing everyday ethical responses to violence, or the ways ordinary people participate in struggles to define and transform social reality, the dissertation underscores the importance-and the difficulties-of creating meaningful relationships with real individuals who represent ""otherness,"" recognizing them as multi-dimensional human beings rather than caricatures.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Introduction: The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) involves both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, with focus on the mutationin the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA). Objective: To analyse the polymorphism SNCA-A53T in patients with familial PD (FPD) and sporadic PD (SPD). Method: A total of 294 individuals were studied, regardless of sex and with mixed ethnicity. The study group with 154 patients with PD, and the control group included 140 individuals without PD. The genotyping of SNCA-A53T was performed by PCR/RFLP. Significance level was p < 0.05. Results: Among all patients, 37 (24%) had FPD and 117 (75.9%) had SPD. The absence of SNCA-A53T mutation was observed in all individuals. Conclusion: SPD is notably observed in patients. However, the SNCA-A53T mutation was absent in all individuals, which does not differ controls from patients. This fact should be confirmed in a Brazilian study case with a more numerous and older population.

Peer Reviewed Journal",,"Adolescents from areas of high deprivation are often assumed to have low aspirations for the future. However, recent research has suggested otherwise and there have been calls for more substantial investigation into the relationship between poverty and aspiration. This article reports levels and variation in aspiration from 1214 adolescents (49.5 % male; 50.5 % female) living in areas of high deprivation across 20 London boroughs. A strength of this study is our large and diverse population of low socio-economic status (SES) adolescents, comprising of white British (22 %), black African (21 %), black Caribbean (9 %), Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi/Other Asian (24 %), mixed ethnicity (9 %), and 15 % defining themselves as Other. Our measures indicated a high group level of reported aspiration with notable variations. Females reported higher educational (but not occupational) aspirations than males; white British students reported lower educational and occupational aspirations than other ethnic groups; and black African children reported the highest educational aspirations. Perceived parental support for education had the largest positive association with aspirations. In contrast to previous findings from studies carried out in the United States, aspirations were found to be negatively associated with perceptions of school and school peer environment. These measures explored feelings of safety, happiness and belonging within the school environment and school peer group. We discuss possible explanations for this unexpected finding within our population of adolescents from UK state schools and how it might affect future policy interventions. This study makes an important contribution to the literature on adolescent aspirations because of the unique nature of the data sample and the multiple domains of functioning and aspiration measured.

The MMPI-2-RF, composed of 338 of the 567 MMPI-2 items, is designed to measure the core clinical constructs assessed by the MMPI-2, but in a more psychometrically sound and efficient manner (Ben-Porath and Tellegen 2008/2011). Law enforcement comparison group data are embedded in the scoring software for the inventory, and reported in the User's Guide for the MMPI-2-RF Police Candidate Interpretive Report (PCIR; Corey and Ben-Porath 2014). In the present concurrent validity study, conceptually based hypotheses regarding associations between MMPI-2-RF scales and scores on the Inwald Personality Inventory (IPI, Inwald et al. 1982; Hilson Research 2006), a test specifically designed to screen law enforcement officers, were tested with a sample of 277 male, full-time police officer candidates from four separate police departments of varying sizes examined after a conditional offer of employment was tendered. The majority of participants were Caucasian (69%), followed by African-American (27%), or Other/Mixed ethnicity (4%). Our hypotheses were largely borne out, lending support to the construct validity of the MMPI-2-RF and the ability of scores on the inventory to assess variables relevant to police candidate evaluations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Aims: To explore the role of psychiatric admission, diagnosis and reported unfair treatment in the relationship between ethnicity and mistrust of mental health services. Methods: The Mental Illness-Related Investigations on Discrimination (MIRIAD) study was a cross-sectional study of 202 individuals using secondary mental health services in South London. Two structural equation models were estimated, one using Admission (whether admitted to hospital for psychiatric treatment in the past 5 years) and one using involuntary admission to hospital in the past 5 years. Results: Increased mistrust was directly associated with the latent variable 'unfair treatment by mental health services and staff' and with Black or mixed ethnicity in both models. Those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum (as compared to depression and bipolar disorder) had a lower average score on the latent variable, suggesting that on average they reported less unfair treatment. We found evidence of increased reporting of unfair treatment by those who had an admission in the past 5 years, had experienced involuntary admission, and for people of Black of mixed Black and White ethnicity. Conclusions: Neither prevalence of schizophrenia spectrum nor rates of hospital admission explained the greater mistrust of mental health services found among people of Black and mixed Black and White ethnicity compared with White ethnicity. Rather, people of Black and mixed Black and white ethnicity may be more likely to experience unfair treatment, generating mistrust; furthermore, this group is more likely to express mistrust even after accounting for reporting of unfair treatment by mental health services and staff.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Studies have shown that individuals with intellectual disability (ID) are aware of stigma and are able to describe experiences of being treated negatively. However, there have been no cross-cultural studies examining whether self-reported experiences of stigma vary between ethnic groups. Method: Participants with mild and moderate ID were recruited from a number of different settings in Cape Town, South Africa. Self-reported experiences of stigma in three ethnic groups were measured using the South African version of the Perceived Stigma of Intellectual Disability tool, developed by the authors. One-way anova was used to test whether there were differences in the total stigma score between the ethnic groups. Regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with stigma. Results: A total of 191 participants agreed to take part; 53 were Black, 70 were of mixed ethnicity and 68 were Caucasian. There were no differences in the levels of stigma reported by the three groups but the Black African ethnic group were more likely to report being physically attacked and being stared at, but were also more likely to report that they thought they were 'the same as other people'. There was an interaction effect between ethnicity and level of ID, with participants with mild ID from the Black African group reporting higher levels of stigma compared with those with moderate ID. Younger age was the only factor that was associated with stigma but there was a trend towards ethnicity, additional disability and socio-economic status being related to stigma. Conclusion: Interventions should target the Black African community in South Africa and should include the reduction of both public stigma and self-reported stigma.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In UK higher education, the attainment of ethnic minority students is lower than that of white students, and this remains the case when differences in entry qualifications have been taken into account. The present study investigated whether the under-attainment of ethnic minority students might be due to the nature of the feedback that they received for their assignments. The assignments submitted by 470 ethnic minority and 470 matched white students taking a distance-learning course were compared using a computer system, Open Mentor, to categorise the feedback given by tutors based on a scheme devised by Bales. Asian and black students and students of mixed ethnicity obtained lower marks for their assignments than did the white students. However, there were only small differences between the ethnic minority students and the white students in terms of the pattern of feedback that they received, and these disappeared when the marks that they had received for their assignments had been taken into account. It is concluded that students from all ethnic groups received feedback that was commensurate with their marks, and that the origins of the attainment gap in ethnic minority students in UK higher education must be sought elsewhere.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Studies on stylised language use have tended to focus on the creative exploitation of linguistic heteroglossia among urban multi-ethnic youth. This article argues that there are good reasons for exploring how such practices can also be initiated by norm-enforcing white adults such as teachers. I report on linguistic ethnographic fieldwork in one mixed-ethnicity class at a Brussels Dutch-medium school and describe how one teacher often produced the creative, stylised language use one usually associates with younger speakers. The analysis emphasizes that while teacher stylisations provided alleviation from the friction between linguistic expectations and the reality of the classroom floor, they were also functional in maintaining the school linguistic policy inasmuch as they typified nonstylised, nonaccented, and standard language use as normal and expected. These findings suggest that stylisations can be closely tuned to linguistic normativity and reproductive of wider patterns of sociolinguistic stratification.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Introduction: We assessed the prevalence and frequency of waterpipe smoking among adults (aged 18+ years) in Great Britain (GB) and determined demographic factors associated with use. Methods: We used cross-sectional representative population surveys conducted online in 2012 and 2013. A total of 12,436 adults in 2012 and 12,171 in 2013 were recruited from a commercial online survey panel. Results: The prevalence of ever use of waterpipe across both survey years combined was 11.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0-12.1). Frequent use (at least once or twice a month) was 1.0% (95% CI = 0.8-1.2) and was similar in both 2012 and 2013. There was some suggestion of increased ever but not frequent use among 18-24-year-olds between survey years. After adjustment for covariates, females had lower odds of ever waterpipe use than males (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.63-0.79), those in the lowest social grade had lower odds of use compared to those in the highest social grade (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.35-0.54), older people were at much lower odds of ever use than younger people, ever having smoked cigarettes increased odds of ever waterpipe use, and being Asian (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.39-2.45) or of mixed ethnicity (OR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.64-3.40) increased likelihood of ever use compared to White ethnicity. Conclusions: Frequent waterpipe smoking was relatively rare in these representative samples of the GB adult population, and prevalence was similar between 2012 and 2013. Continued monitoring and targeted interventions are appropriate.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: The unfair treatment of individuals with severe mental illness has been linked to poorer physical and mental health outcomes. Additionally, anticipation of discrimination may lead some individuals to avoid participation in particular life areas, leading to greater isolation and social marginalisation. This study aimed to establish the levels and clinical and socio-demographic associations of anticipated and experienced discrimination amongst those diagnosed with a schizophrenia and comparator severe mental illnesses (bipolar and major depressive disorders). Methods: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of anticipated and experienced discrimination from 202 individuals in South London (47% with schizophrenia, 32% with depression and 20% with bipolar disorder). Results: 93% of the sample anticipated discrimination and 87% of participants had experienced discrimination in at least one area of life in the previous year. There was a significant association between the anticipation and the experience of discrimination. Higher levels of experienced discrimination were reported by those of a mixed ethnicity, and those with higher levels of education. Women anticipated more discrimination than men. Neither diagnosis nor levels of functioning were associated with the extent of discrimination. Clinical symptoms of anxiety, depression and suspiciousness were associated with more experienced and anticipated discrimination respectively. Conclusions: The unfair treatment of individuals with severe mental illnesses remains unacceptably common. Population level interventions are needed to reduce levels of discrimination and to safeguard individuals. Interventions are also required to assist those with severe mental illness to reduce internalised stigma and social avoidance.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We sought to examine the fluidity of ethnic identification and test shared reality's hypothesis concerning the effects of interpersonal relationships on ethnic identification. To investigate the effects of ethnicity of spouse on ethnic identification, Asian-American women (66 from same-ethnicity marriages, 46 from mixed-ethnicity marriages) completed several measures of ethnic identification after thinking about positive aspects of their relationship with either their spouse or their mother. Women in same-ethnicity marriages reported equivalent levels of ethnic identification whether they thought about their mother or their spouse. Women in mixed-ethnicity marriages reported lower ethnic identification when they thought about their different-ethnicity spouse; but when thinking about their mother, they reported high ethnic identification equivalent to the levels reported by women in same-ethnicity marriages. Mediational analyses revealed that, consistent with shared reality theory, shared understanding of one's ethnic identity with one's spouse partially mediated the relationship between same- and different-ethnicity spouses and ethnic identification. Implications for theories of ethnic identity and for individuals in mixed-ethnicity romantic relationships are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study identified longitudinal risk factors for body dissatisfaction (BD) over a 10-year period from adolescence to young adulthood. Participants (N = 2,134; age at baseline: M = 15.0, SD = 1.6 years) provided two waves of survey data. A six-step hierarchical linear regression analysis examined the predictive contribution of Time 1 BD, weight status, demographics, family and peer environmental factors, and psychological factors. Among females, Asian race/ethnicity, low self-esteem, greater BD, and higher body mass index (BMI) during adolescence contributed significantly to predicting greater BD at 10-year follow up (R2 = .27). Among males, demographics (i.e., Asian, other-mixed ethnicity, education attainment), depressive symptoms, greater BD, higher BMI, more parent communication, and less peer weight teasing during adolescence contributed to BD at follow-up (R2 = .27). Findings indicate who may be at greatest risk of BD in young adulthood and the types of factors that should be addressed during adolescence.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: In the UK, there has been growing concern about the incidence and prognosis of psychosis in minority ethnic groups for a number of years. Negative self-appraisals after first-episode psychosis (FEP) are associated with post-psychotic depression, poor functioning and suicidality. In carers, appraisals of loss and decreased control are linked with high expressed emotion and relapse; however, as yet there has been no investigation as to how ethnicity and culture relate to these negative appraisals in FEP. Aims: The study aims to investigate the occurrence of negative illness appraisals, for example, loss and shame, in FEP within different ethnic and social-cultural groups. In addition, it aims to explore influence of insight, recovery style and carers' appraisals in the development of negative appraisals. Methods: There were 67 patients and 46 carers who completed reliable and valid measures on beliefs about illness, insight and recovery style. Data on ethnicity and deprivation were also collected. Results: Black patients experienced significantly less loss, lack of control and entrapment than White, Asian and mixed ethnicity patients, yet these were not explained by lower levels of insight or recovery style. Patient's and carer's appraisals were highly correlated. Conclusion: Black patients, in spite of higher incidence and poorer outcome in FEP, experienced less loss and shame. Possible explanations, including a protective aspect of alternative health belief models, are explored. This area provides much scope for further investigation. Strong relationships between patient and carer appraisals indicate that family interventions are essential to improved clinical outcomes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The current study investigated: (a) the relationships of exposure to the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) with reductions in substance use, illegal activity, and juvenile justice system involvement in adolescents diagnosed with a substance use disorder, and (b) the pathways by which reductions in the target behaviors were achieved. This study is a secondary data analysis of longitudinal data from a large-scale implementation effort for A-CRA. The sample consisted of 1,467 adolescents who presented to substance use treatment and reported past-year engagement in illegal activity. Participants had an average age of 15.8 years (SD = 1.3) and were 25% female, 14% African American, 29% Hispanic, 35% Caucasian, 16% mixed ethnicity, and 6% other ethnicity. Path analyses provided support that participation in A-CRA had a significant, direct association with reduced substance use; a significant, indirect association with reduced illegal activity through reductions in substance use; and a significant indirect association with reduced juvenile justice system involvement through reductions in both substance use and illegal activity. In addition, post hoc analyses using a bootstrapping strategy provided evidence that reductions in substance use partially mediated the relationship between A-CRA and illegal activity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Tai chi (TC) has been shown to positively influence health-related fitness (HRF) of elderly participants by affording them a means to increase musculoskeletal strength. The objective of this study was to examine TC intervention effects on HRF and whether ethnic groups not culturally related to TC experienced a barrier to participation in a community-based program for low-income older adults. Seventy-eight older mixed-ethnicity adults (age 55 and older) who were not culturally affiliated with TC were recruited for this study. HRF measures were taken before and after a 16-week TC program that offered seven sessions per week. Significant improvements were found in upper and lower musculoskeletal fitness and partial curl-ups, with TC being embraced by the participants. These results suggest that TC can be effective for improving HRF and that non-TC culturally related ethnic groups did not experience a barrier to participation in an older low-socioeconomic population sample.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The issue of children's exposure to violent video games has been a source of considerable debate for several decades. Questions persist whether children with pre-existing mental health problems may be influenced adversely by exposure to violent games, even if other children are not. We explored this issue with 377 children (62 % female, mixed ethnicity, mean age = 12.93) displaying clinically elevated attention deficit or depressive symptoms on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist. Results from our study found no evidence for increased bullying or delinquent behaviors among youth with clinically elevated mental health symptoms who also played violent video games. Our results did not support the hypothesis that children with elevated mental health symptoms constitute a ""vulnerable"" population for video game violence effects. Implications and suggestions for further research are provided.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"To the extent that stereotype and identity threat undermine academic performance, social psychological interventions that lessen threat could buffer threatened students and improve performance. Two studies, each featuring a longitudinal field experiment in a mixed-ethnicity middle school, examined whether a values affirmation writing exercise could attenuate the achievement gap between Latino American and European American students. In Study 1, students completed multiple self-affirmation (or control) activities as part of their regular class assignments. Latino American students, the identity threatened group, earned higher grades in the affirmation than control condition, whereas White students were unaffected. The effects persisted 3 years and, for many students, continued into high school by lifting their performance trajectory. Study 2 featured daily diaries to examine how the affirmation affected psychology under identity threat, with the expectation that it would shape students' narratives of their ongoing academic experience. By conferring a big-picture focus, affirmation was expected to broaden construals, prevent daily adversity from being experienced as identity threat, and insulate academic motivation from identity threat. Indeed, affirmed Latino American students not only earned higher grades than nonaffirmed Latino American students but also construed events at a more abstract than concrete level and were less likely to have their daily feelings of academic fit and motivation undermined by identity threat. Discussion centers on how social-psychological processes propagate themselves over time and how timely interventions targeting these processes can promote well-being and achievement.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study examined exposure to violence and risk for lethality in intimate partner relationships as factors related to co-occurring MH problems and use of mental health (MH) resources among women of African descent. Black women with intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences (n = 431) were recruited from primary care, prenatal or family planning clinics in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Severity of IPV was significantly associated with co-occurring MH problems, but was not associated with the use of MH resources among African-American women. Risk for lethality and co-occurring problems were also not significantly related to the use of resources. African Caribbean women with severe physical abuse experiences were significantly less likely to use resources. In contrast, severity of physical abuse was positively associated with the use of resources among Black women with mixed ethnicity. Severe IPV experiences are risk factors for co-occurring MH problems, which in turn, increases the need for MH services. However, Black women may not seek help for MH problems. Thus, social work practitioners in health care settings must thoroughly assess women for their IPV experiences and develop tailored treatment plans that address their abuse histories and MH needs.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia with spinal muscular atrophy, also known as PCH1, is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by generalized muscle weakness and global developmental delay commonly resulting in early death. Gene defects had been discovered only in single patients until the recent identification of EXOSC3 mutations in several families with relatively mild course of PCH1.We aim to genetically stratify subjects in a large and well-defined cohort to define the clinical spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation. Methods: We documented clinical, neuroimaging, and morphologic data of 37 subjects from 27 families with PCH1. EXOSC3 gene sequencing was performed in 27 unrelated index patients of mixed ethnicity. Results: Biallelic mutations in EXOSC3 were detected in 10 of 27 families (37%). The most common mutation among all ethnic groups was c.395A>C, p.D132A, responsible for 11 (55%) of the 20 mutated alleles and ancestral in origin. The mutation-positive subjects typically presented with normal pregnancy, normal birth measurements, and relative preservation of brainstem and cortical structures. Psychomotor retardation was profound in all patients but lifespan was variable, with 3 subjects surviving beyond the late teens. Abnormal oculomotor function was commonly observed in patients surviving beyond the first year. Major clinical features previously reported in PCH1, including intrauterine abnormalities, postnatal hypoventilation and feeding difficulties, joint contractures, and neonatal death,were rarely observed in mutation-positive infants but were typical among the mutation-negative subjects. Conclusion: EXOSC3 mutations account for 30%-40% of patients with PCH1 with variability in survival and clinical severity that is correlated with the genotype.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Many studies show agreement within and between populations and cultures for general judgments of facial attractiveness. Studies that have examined the attractiveness of specific traits have also highlighted cross-cultural differences for factors such as symmetry, averageness, and masculinity. One trait that should be preferred across cultures is heterozygosity. Indeed, several studies suggest that mixed ethnicity, in terms of appearing to possess a mixture of traits from different human population groups, may be found attractive, which could reflect preferences for heterozygosity. We examined preferences for manipulated face shape associated with different populations in both Europeans (Britain) and Africans (Guinea-Bissau). We found that mixed-ethnicity face shapes were more attractive than enhanced single-ethnicity face shape across both populations. These results are consistent with evolutionary theories suggesting individuals should prefer heterozygosity in partners because facial cues to mixed-ethnicity are likely to indicate diverse genes compared to cues that indicate a face belongs to a single particular culture or population.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Many claims are made about the significance of interethnic partnerships for individuals and for society. Such partnerships continue to be seen as a ""barometer"" of the openness of society and have spawned extensive analysis investigating their patterns, trends, and determinants. But we know little about the experience of children growing up in families of mixed parentage. In the United Kingdom, the increase in the self-defined ""mixed"" population is often celebrated. But there has been little quantitative sociological analysis that has investigated the circumstances of the children of mixed ethnicity partnerships. Using two large-scale UK datasets that cover a similar period, this article evaluates the extent to which mixed parentage families are associated with circumstances (both economic and in terms of family structure) that tend to be positive or negative for children's future life chances and how these compare to those of children with parents from the same ethnic group. It shows that there is substantial variation according to the outcome considered but also according to ethnic group. Overall, children in mixed parent-age families do not unequivocally experience the equality of outcomes with majority group children that the assimilation hypothesis implies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background/Study Context: The current study examined the relationship between intellectual control and cognition and related the results to everyday problem solving in a mixed ethnicity sample of 35% African American and 65% Caucasian elders. Methods: Participants completed the Personality in Intellectual Aging Contexts Inventory (PIC; Lachman et al., 1982, Journal of Research in Personality, 16, 485-501), Everyday Cognition Battery (ECB; Allaire & Marsiske, 1999, Psychology & Aging, 14, 627-644; 2002, Psychology & Aging, 17, 101-115), and a battery of basic cognitive ability tests assessing memory, inductive reasoning, and verbal meaning. Results: Results indicated that African Americans had significantly lower intellectual control beliefs relative to Caucasian older adults. Regression models suggested that relationship between control beliefs and cognition was moderated by education and race. Decomposing the interactions with simple slope analysis revealed that across cognitive abilities, better cognitive performance was related to higher control beliefs in African Americans with at least 13 years of education. A similar relationship was also found in Caucasian elders with lower education. Conclusion: African American elders' reaching a higher level of education may provide a basis for which individual differences in intellectual control beliefs are activated and thereby more strongly associated with cognitive performance.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: This study evaluated the ability of delinquent peer affiliation to mediate the effects of multidimensional treatment foster care (MTFC; Chamberlain, 2003) on girls' delinquent behavior. Method: This study used a sample of girls from 2 cohorts (N = 166; M = 15.31 years old at baseline, range 13-17 years; 74% European American, 2% African American, 7% Hispanic, 4% Native American, 1% Asian, and 13% mixed ethnicity) and measures of delinquent behavior, including general delinquency, number of criminal referrals, and number of days in locked settings. As the mediator, we used self-reports of affiliation with delinquent peers. Our analytic plan specified an intent-to-treat analysis within the framework of a randomized controlled trial comparing MTFC with traditional community-based group care. Results: Random assignment to the MTFC program reduced girls' number of criminal referrals and number of days in locked settings at 24 months. The MTFC condition also reduced girls' exposure to delinquent peers at 12 months, which in turn reduced levels of all forms of delinquent behavior at 24 months; indirect effects were statistically significant. Conclusions: Reduction in exposure to delinquent peers mediated MTFC effects on the number of criminal referrals and number of days in locked settings; delinquent peers also served as an intervening variable between MTFC and self-report delinquency, suggesting that, by reducing contact with delinquent peers, MTFC helped to encourage lower levels of self-report delinquency. Existing prevention and intervention programs targeting similar populations may benefit from increased attention to reductions in delinquent peer affiliation in female samples.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Using data from a study of reliability and validity of a screening tool for co-occurring substance abuse and mental health problems, our objective was to compare behavioral health issues of female smokers and nonsmokers and explore correlates of smoking. Methods: Using a convenience sample (n = 1021), we recruited participants to complete an online survey conducted in substance abuse treatment, primary care, mental health services, senior, and public settings. The survey included demographic questions, smoking status, the co-occurring disorders screening tool, the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener (GAIN-SS) and the Postraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)- Civilian. Results: One third of participants self-identified as smokers, and African American, American Indian, and bisexual women reported the highest rates of smoking. Seventy-two percent of women reported at least one mental health problem in the past year; 29% had a past year substance abuse problem, and 26% reported a past year co-occurring disorder of both. Smokers had significantly higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), past year depression and anxiety, suicidality, past year substance abuse, and co-occurring disorders. Smokers also had significantly higher rates of lifetime intimate partner violence (IPV) and childhood abuse. Conclusions: Smoking in women was associated with significantly higher rates of mental health and substance abuse problems. Substance abuse, being in a treatment setting, IPV, African American and mixed ethnicity, Medicaid insurance status, reduced income, and no home ownership were identified as predictors of smoking. Screening and evaluation of smoking status, mental health, substance use disorders, and the presence and impact of violence are essential for women's health.

We identified 378 eligible individuals (incidence: 45.1/100 000 person-years, 95% CI 40.8-49.9). Rates varied across these services, but were 2-3 times higher than those on which services were commissioned. Risk decreased with age, was nearly doubled among men and differed by ethnic group; doubled in people of mixed ethnicity but lower for those of Asian origin, compared with White British people. Psychosis risk among ethnic minorities was lower than reported in urban settings, which has potential implications for aetiology.

As such, I explore how contextual and community circumstances, in particular the experience of being differentially marked, influence the salience of racial, ethnic and cultural difference to an individual. Further, I examine how cultural conflict and affiliation mediate feelings of difference, the strategies that individuals develop to navigate and negotiate their multiple cultural worlds, and their self-identification. Personal narratives were elicited through semi-structured interviews from 25 self-identified African American and 19 self-identified mixed ethnicity youth (18-22 years of age), focusing on their life experiences as multi cultural individuals. Interviews were coded and then analyzed using mixed methods of analysis. Results indicate relationships among diversity of the participant's community of practice, level of perceived conflict and navigational strategies, as well as among basis of differential marking, level of perceived conflict and feelings of otherness. Results support the assumption that identification is not a static outcome built through static stages, rather, it is a process that is shaped by contextual circumstances.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter provides a broad overview of the history of psychology in Brazil from the first notions of psychological though in the country's colonial period through the inception of scientific psychology in the late 19th and early 20th century, up to the consolidation of psychology as profession and scientific practice throughout the 20th century. Psychological ideas first arrived in Brazil through Jesuit clericals, who were in charge of the colony's education from the 16th century to the middle of 18th century, when they were banned from the Portuguese Kingdom. Children of Native, European, and mixed ethnicity were in the same classes, and Jesuits assimilated the ideas of Native Brazilians about child development and education into their own propositions. Higher education was prohibited in the Portuguese colonies up to the 19th century. Brazilian nationals interested in pursuing academic degrees in law or medicine had to do so in Portugal or France, up to 1808, when the country's first two Medical Schools were created. Throughout these schools, new European ideas about psychology arrived in Brazil. The school in Rio de Janeiro was more concerned about neuropsychiatry, psychophysiology, and neurology. In Salvador, the medical school focused on the study of criminology, forensic psychiatry, mental hygiene, social psychology, and pedagogy. In the early 20th century, psychological laboratories were first established in normal schools (aimed at training teachers for child education) and mental hospitals. Laboratories were implemented by Brazilian students of European and American psychologists, or by the foreign scholars themselves. They visited the country by official invitation, and some eventually settled here. Psychology was recognized as a profession in Brazil by a federal law in 1962. By that time, training and research in psychology were organized around major theoretical approaches, mainly psychoanalysis. It is argued that the current trend of psychology in Brazil is toward growing specialization and consolidation of its subdisciplines, reflected on a growing number of scientific societies and specialized periodicals.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: To determine how ethnic background influences early sexual activity among young adults. Methods: Quantitative data were collected during the Research with East London Adolescents Community Health Survey study, a population-based survey of young adults belonging to white and black and minority ethnic groups and residing in east London in 2001 (n = 2,689) and 2003 (n = 2,675). Qualitative data were obtained from 146 young adults between January and September 2003. Results: Black Caribbean, black African, white other, and mixed ethnicity young men were most likely to report high-risk sexual behaviors, that is, sexual debut at the age of <13 years, having unprotected sex, and having multiple sexual partners. There were marked variations within groups commonly collapsed as ""black"" or as ""Muslim."" Black Caribbean and black African young adults reported high rates of protective behaviors in addition to risk behaviors. Qualitative data confirmed variations in sexual behavior within ethnic groups. Longitudinally, risk of engaging in two or more high-risk sexual behaviors was predicted by low family support (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.6-4.9), regular smoking (OR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.7-12.0), and usage of illicit drugs (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.5-5.8), with lower risk predicted by low peer support (OR: .3, 95% CI: .2-.6). Conclusions: Young adults belonging to black and minority ethnic groups reported a wide variation in sexual risk behaviors. High levels of high-risk behaviors were reported in ethnic groups known to have high rates of sexually transmitted infections. Effective sexual health interventions should be started early and they must focus on sexual debut and partner choices as well as messages regarding safe sex.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Circumcision is efficacious in reducing HIV acquisition in heterosexual males. The South Africa government has been reluctant to adopt a national circumcision programme, possibly due to concerns that circumcision may result in decreased condom use. Objective: To identify the determinants of demand for male circumcision, to examine variations by ethnicity, and to determine whether it is demanded to avoid condom use. Methods: 403 parents and 237 sons in Johannesburg, South Africa, were recruited through a randomized household survey, with oversampling to balance between blacks (n = 220), 'coloured' (mixed ethnicity) (n = 202) and whites (n = 218). The demand for male circumcision was estimated using a conjoint analysis, with each respondent randomly receiving four tasks comparing seven possible benefits-six identified through key informant interviews and one for condom avoidance. Respondents' choices were analysed using logistic regression, including stratified analyses to test for homogeneity. Results: Overall, circumcision's beneficial effects on HIV transmission (P < 0.001), sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission (P < 0.001), hygiene (P < 0.05) and sex (P < 0.05) were identified as determinants of demand, but the condom avoidance hypothesis was rejected as it was 'repulsive' to respondents (P < 0.001). Consistent results were found for blacks (P < 0.001) and coloured (P < 0.001), but not for whites who found condom avoidance attractive (P < 0.04), a result not explained by variations in wealth, age or paternal circumcision status. Conclusions: Male circumcision programmes should be tailored to accommodate variations in the determinants of demand across the target population. We find that circumcision's protective effect against HIV acquisition in men is the only determinant to be found consistently across all ethnic groups in Johannesburg. We also find that concerns over condom avoidance may have been overstated. This said, male circumcision strategies should reinforce a range of HIV prevention strategies, including condom use, as we find evidence that whites may view circumcision as a means to avoid condom use.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper investigates informal learning, literacy and language development occurring in the home through exchanges between children of three to six years of age and their grandparents in Sylheti/Bengali-speaking families of Bangladeshi origin and monolingual English-speaking families of mixed ethnicity living in east London. A survey identifying the range of learning activities taking place in and around the home is reported and extracts from case study material from nine families obtained through interviews, video-recording and scrapbooks are explored in terms of the patterns of interaction, the kinds of knowledge exchanged and the discursive opportunities opened up in this process. The findings are interpreted in relation to sociocultural theory where the understandings and skills held by both adults and children can be regarded as contributing to learning as a joint enterprise. The relevance of the exchanges is considered in relation to the shifts between the discursive spaces in which language learning occurs.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Collaborative approaches such as Problem Based Learning (PBL) may provide the opportunity to bring together diverse students but their efficacy in practice and the complications that arise due to the mixed ethnicity needs further investigation. This study explores the key advantages and problems of heterogeneous PBL groups from the students' and teachers' opinions. Focus groups were conducted with a stratified sample of second year medical students and their PBL teachers. We found that students working in heterogeneous groupings interact with students with whom they don't normally interact with, learn a lot more from each other because of their differences in language and academic preparedness and become better prepared for their future professions in multicultural societies. On the other hand we found students segregating in the tutorials along racial lines and that status factors disempowered students and subsequently their productivity. Among the challenges was also that academic and language diversity hindered student learning. In light of these the recommendations were that teachers need special diversity training to deal with heterogeneous groups and the tensions that arise. Attention should be given to create 'the right mix' for group learning in diverse student populations. The findings demonstrate that collaborative heterogeneous learning has two sides that need to be balanced. On the positive end we have the 'ideology' behind mixing diverse students and on the negative the 'practice' behind mixing students. More research is needed to explore these variations and their efficacy in more detail.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: This study examined ethnic disparities in antipsychotic therapy in a population with significant Asian representation. Methods: Using a cross-sectional retrospective study design, self-reported ethnicity data pooled from three cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey were linked to 2005 administrative data on physician, hospital, and pharmaceutical use in British Columbia, Canada. Logistic regression was used to model the association between ethnicity and the likelihood of filling one or more prescriptions for any antipsychotic, with controls for sex, age, residence, immigrant status, income, health status, and diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and dementia. Results: Of the 27,658 individuals in the sample, 2.2% filled at least one antipsychotic prescription. The proportion varied across ethnic groups: Chinese, 1.0%; other Asians, 1.2%; whites, 2.3%; nonwhite non-Asians, 2.8%; and mixed ethnicity, 4.3%. After adjustment for patient characteristics and diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the likelihood of filling a prescription was found to be lower among Chinese (odds ratio [OR] = .47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .24-.90) and higher among persons of mixed ethnicity (OR = 3.19, CI = 1.49-6.83). Further adjustment for depression and dementia diagnoses did not significantly change the ORs for the Chinese (OR = .49, CI = .25-.98) and the mixed ethnic groups (OR = 2.97, CI = 1.30-6.80). Conclusions: Consistent with the existing literature on ethnic disparities in antipsychotic therapy, the study found evidence of persistent disparities in a population that has a significant number of Asians. Further studies should be done to identify possible causes of these disparities and to identify potential interventions that may reduce or eliminate them.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Method: This cross-sectional observational study was performed in 2007 by convenience sampling of 1031 full-time undergraduate students registered in years 1, 2 and 3 in the academic year 2007/2008, administering a basic demographics questionnaire along with the standardised General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) to each participant. Results: The population of full-time students at the University of the West Indies (UWI) was found to be mentally healthy (median GHQ score was 5.00; GHQ = 6 considered ""mentally unhealthy""). However, median GHQ scores were lowest (4.00) in the Faculties of Medical Sciences and Social Sciences, but highest (6.00) in the Faculty of Humanities and Education. Furthermore, analysis showed that females were less mentally healthy than males attending the UWI. With regard to ethnicity, the African group was the most mentally healthy group whereas the group of mixed ethnicity was the least. Religion was also shown to significantly affect the GHQ (4.00 for Christians and Hindus, 6.00 for Muslims and 8.00 for those categorized as 'other'). Most interesting was the relationship of GHQ scores with the manner in which participants related to their lecturers, classmates, guardians, siblings and friends; it was found that the better one related to these people, the lower one's GHQ score was and hence one was considered more mentally healthy. Conclusions: UWI full-time undergraduate students are mentally healthy, but gender, ethnicity, religion, quality of relationships and faculty of study still contribute to significant differences within the population. This allows high-risk individuals to be identified and indicates where steps can be taken to improve mental health.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The number of people with a 'mixed' ethnicity heritage is growing in contemporary Britain. Research in this area has largely focused on implications for cultural and racialized identities, and little is known about associated economic and social factors. Data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a representative panel survey of children born in 2000-2001, are used to examine the circumstances of mixed ethnicity children in comparison with their non-mixed and white counterparts. Findings suggest a cultural location between 'white' and minority identities, and socio-economic advantage in comparison with non-mixed counterparts. For example, households of non-mixed white children had poorer economic profiles than households of both mixed white and mixed Indian children. This effect is associated with the presence of a white parent, and the factors underlying it are examined. Although the statistical approach used bypasses a consideration of the dynamics of identity, it provides important evidence on stratification and inequality, and the factors driving this.

Mixed children, those with parents of different ethnic group membership, are a source of important statistical idiosyncrasies in data collection and population distributions. In this paper I examine the dynamics surrounding an intermarried, Hispanic parents' ethnic identification of a mixed child. The data for this study is from the 5-percent Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the 2000 United States (U.S.) Census. This research includes only intermarried couples where one parent is a Hispanic and the other parent is a non-Hispanic. Logistic regressions are used to predict the likelihood that mixed ethnicity children are reported as non-Hispanic. Ethnicity of the daughter and son is measured as dichotomous, as either Hispanic or non-Hispanic. Demographic and socio-economic parental characteristics are used to test hypotheses for the likelihood of non-Hispanic identification of a multi-ethnic child. The results of this study demonstrate that choices of ethnic identification for Hispanic or Non-Hispanic children are increasingly optional and can be predicted based on a number of important parent attributes including, parental U.S. citizenship and the ability to speak English, for both daughters and sons. The predictive characteristics result in differences for sons and daughters. In sum, demographic change is not only a consequence of births, deaths, and immigration but also a consequence of optional Hispanic ethnic identification selection for children of intermarriage.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Comment/Reply,"Comments on an article, Relative efficiency of chlamydia screening in non-clinical settings in two California counties by Morris et al. (2001). In December 2009, for a medical student research project, we conducted an on-site, self-administered, questionnaire survey of 250 consecutive genitourinary (GU) medicine clinic attendees to explore attitudes to chlamydia testing using a mailed test kit. Men would be asked about returning a urine sample and women a self-taken vaginal swab. The majority of responders (67%, 131/195) were women, and the mean age was 27 years (range 14-55). Of 196 responders, nearly one-third (32%) described themselves as being of black (African, Caribbean or mixed) ethnicity, 58% as white and the remainder as other ethnic groups. The main limitation to the study is that in spite of most respondents saying they would be willing to return postal samples for chlamydia testing, it is likely that actual response rates would be much less in practice. Our results from an ethnically diverse inner city population suggest that a public health campaign involving postal chlamydia testing could also contribute to the control of chlamydia infection in some ethnically diverse, possibly hard-to-reach populations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: In a randomized clinical trial with 111 families of parents with a history of major depressive disorder (86% mothers, 14% fathers; 86% Caucasian, 5% African-American, 3% Hispanic, 1% American Indian or Alaska Native, 4% mixed ethnicity), changes in adolescents' (mean age = 11 years; 42% female, 58% male) coping and parents' parenting skills were examined as mediators of the effects of a family group cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Method: Changes in hypothesized mediators were assessed at 6 months, and changes in adolescents' symptoms were measured at a 12-month follow-up. Results: Significant differences favoring the family intervention compared with a written information comparison condition were found for changes in composite measures of parent-adolescent reports of adolescents' use of secondary control coping skills and direct observations of parents' positive parenting skills. Changes in adolescents' secondary control coping and positive parenting mediated the effects of the intervention on depressive, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms, accounting for approximately half of the effect of the intervention on the outcomes. Further, reciprocal relations between children's internalizing symptoms and parenting were found from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: The present study provides the first evidence for specific mediators of a family group cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for families of parents with a history of major depressive disorder. The identification of both coping and parenting as mediators of children's mental health outcomes suggests that these variables are important active ingredients in the prevention of mental health problems in children of depressed parents.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Latin America is the world region with the highest rates of youth tobacco use and widest socioeconomic gaps, yet no data are available on smoking among Indigenous people, the largest disadvantaged group in the region. A self-administered survey of 3,131 8th grade youth enrolled in a random sample of 27 urban and rural schools was administered in 2004 in Jujuy, Argentina. Standard questions adapted from global surveys were used. Compared with youth of European background (11.4%; 95% CI 6.7-15.1), Indigenous (23.0%; 95% CI 21.0-25.0), and Mixed ethnicity (23%; 95% CI 18.9-27.1) youth had higher prevalence of current smoking. The odds of current smoking remained significantly elevated for Indigenous (OR 1.9; 95% CI = 1.1-3.3) and Mixed youth (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.4) after controlling for confounders. Other risk factors that were associated with current smoking included: having any friends who smoke, repeating a grade in school, depressive symptoms in previous year, drinking any alcohol in the previous week and thrill seeking orientation. These results underscore the importance of social and cultural diversity aspects of the global tobacco epidemic.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"During the last two decades, there has been a growing emphasis on the delivery of health care to meet the needs of minority ethnic patients, but there is less emphasis on the views of the patients themselves. This paper aimed to give minority ethnic groups the opportunity to voice their opinions on nursing care and to inform future nurse education. Focus groups were used to collect data. Six community groups, some of mixed ethnicity and some of specific ethnic identity, were included in the study. Data were analysed using a thematic approach and three themes were identified as representing the views of the participants. Participants identified that knowledge of cultural and religious practices were essential for nurses in order for them to understand the basis of their beliefs and practices. They also highlighted how the actions and behaviour of nurses either confirmed or ignored their specific requirements. They also recognised the inherent communication problems for those who had difficulty in communicating in English. Overall, they reiterated their need to be treated with dignity and respect. For nurse educators, the challenge is to develop not only the knowledge base of student nurses but also to help them translate that into practice that demonstrates cultural understanding and sensitivity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"While few studies have identified predictors of exiting homelessness among adults, even fewer studies have attempted to identify these predictors among homeless youth. The current study explored predictors of change in homelessness among 180 homeless youth between the ages of 14 and 22, recruited through an urban drop-in center. All youth were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The sample included 118 males and the reported ethnicity included Latino (n = 54), Anglo (n = 73), Native American (n = 24), African American (n = 6) and mixed ethnicity or ""other"" (n = 23). Four distinct patterns of change in homelessness were identified among youth which included those who (1) had fairly low rates of homelessness at each follow-up point, (2) started in the mid-range of homelessness, increased at 3 months and sharply declined at 6-months (MHL), (3) reported high rates of homelessness at baseline and low rates at each follow-up point (HLL), and finally, (4) remained consistently homeless across time (HMH). These patterns of change were most strongly predicted by social connections and engagement in HIV risk behaviors. The findings from this study suggest that developing trust and linkages between homeless youth and service providers may be a more powerful immediate target of intervention than targeting child abuse issues, substance use and mental health problems.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: Private cord blood banks are for-profit companies that facilitate storage of umbilical cord blood for personal or family use. Pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians are currently best situated to use cord blood therapeutically. We sought to describe the experiences and views of these physicians regarding private cord blood banking. Participants and methods: We e-mailed a cross-sectional survey to pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians in the United States and Canada; 93 of 152 potentially eligible physicians (93 of 130 confirmed survey recipients) from 57 centers responded. Questions addressed the number of transplants performed by using privately banked cord blood, willingness to use banked autologous cord blood in specific clinical settings, and recommendations to parents regarding private cord blood banking. Results: Respondents reported having performed 9 autologous and 41 allogeneic transplants using privately banked cord blood. In 36 of 40 allogeneic cases for which data were available, the cord blood had been collected because of a known indication in the recipient. Few respondents would choose autologous cord blood over alternative stem cell sources for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second remission. In contrast, 55% would choose autologous cord blood to treat high-risk neuroblastoma, or to treat severe aplastic anemia in the absence of an available sibling donor. No respondent would recommend private cord blood banking for a newborn with 1 healthy sibling when both parents were of northern European descent; 11% would recommend banking when parents were of different minority ethnicities. Conclusions: Few transplants have been performed by using cord blood stored in the absence of a known indication in the recipient. Willingness to use banked autologous cord blood varies depending on disease and availability of alternative stem cell sources. Few pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians endorse private cord blood banking in the absence of an identified recipient, even for mixed-ethnicity children for whom finding a suitably matched unrelated donor may be difficult.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Cellular phones provide a means for parents to monitor and request information about whereabouts, associates, and current activities from adolescents. Simultaneously, adolescents can communicate with parents to inform them of activities and to solicit support or they can also choose to nondisclose. The frequency, duration, and nature of calls may relate to parents' and to adolescents' perceptions of truthfulness and family relationships. 196 dyads (13% father-son, 11% father-daughter, 30% mother- son, and 46% mother-daughter) completed a questionnaire indicating cell phone use, their truthfulness of activities, the nature of their calls to one another, and family relationships. The parents were, on average, 45.38 years old (SD = 6.35) and were 83% Euroamerican, 9% Asian American, 3% Latino, 3% African American, 2% Mixed ethnicity, and 1% American Indian. The adolescents were, on average, 16.25 years old (SD = 1.17) and were 77% Euroamerican, 9% Asian American, 4% Latino, 3% African American, 8% Mixed ethnicity, and .5% American Indian. Correlational analyses revealed that parents who called more frequently reported less truthfulness when speaking to their adolescents via cell phone. Greater frequency in parental calls also was associated with less adolescent-reported truthfulness. From multiple regression analyses, for parents, calls when upset were associated with less parental knowledge and poorer family relations. For adolescents, the same was true; however, adolescents who made calls seeking social support and to ask and confer with parents reported greater perceived parental knowledge and better family relationships.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Jackson, Michigan, is a medium-sized city suffering from a bad economy and obesity-related health issues. Nearly 20% of the 36,000 residents live below the poverty line. It is a relatively young city (median age of 30 years) with a mixed ethnicity (20% black, 73% white, 4% Hispanic). The city offers many structured, active recreational opportunities, but has not integrated physical activity into daily life. Intervention: Project U-Turn aimed to increase active transportation (e.g., biking, walking, and transit use) through an integrated approach to Active Living by Design's community action model and the Michigan Safe Routes to School model. Resources were focused on active living promotions and programs; partnership meetings were the source of changes in policy and physical projects. Each initiative was designed to introduce each of the 5Ps (preparation, promotion, programs, policy, and physical projects) to build support for the partnership's overall work. Results: The partnership collected snapshot data of community walking and biking behavior, percentage of students walking to school, participation in events and programs, and new physical projects. Jackson saw a vast improvement in physical infrastructure and policy and a related increase in walking and biking in the community. Lessons learned: The project engaged in purposeful partnership building to implement effective programs and promotions that built support for policy and physical projects. Limited resources were best used by encouraging partners to contribute and coordinate activities using existing staff, funding, and resources. Conclusions: Jackson has seen a shift toward awareness of the benefits of active living on community health, economic development, and environmental awareness.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We evaluated the relationship between apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms and autism by ascertaining the frequency of alleles and genotypes. A total of 67 (56 male and 11 female) unrelated autistic patients of mixed ethnicity, representative of the Brazilian population, with ages ranging from 4 to 33 years (mean= 16.26 and standard deviation=6.64) were assessed in a case-control type study. The DNA extracted from leukocytes and amplification of the polymorphic fragment was made by polymerase chain reaction. The resulting product was submitted to the restriction fragment length polymorphism technique, with digestion using the HhaI enzyme. There were statistically significant differences in the allelic and genotypic frequencies between the two groups. The results suggest that APOE2 and APOE4 isoforms are involved in the etiological complexity of predisposition for autism.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"There is now considerable evidence that witnessing domestic violence can have adverse consequences for children. Our aim is to present the socio-demographic correlates of children witnessing domestic violence and its association with childhood mental disorders. The biographic, socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics of 7865 children and their families and measures of traumatic events including witnessing domestic violence were entered into a logistic regression analysis to establish the strength of association between witnessing severe domestic violence and childhood disorders. About 4% of children had witnessed severe domestic violence according to parent reports. Factors independently associated with a greater likelihood of a child witnessing domestic violence were: older age group, mixed ethnicity, physical disorder, several children in family, divorced parents, living in rented accommodation, poor neighbourhoods, the mother's emotional state and family dysfunction. Witnessing severe domestic violence almost tripled the likelihood of children having conduct disorder but was not independently associated with emotional disorders. There is a growing need for more research on the consequences of witnessing domestic violence to increase the awareness of social workers and policy-makers to identify the needs of children who witness domestic violence.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Mixed ethnicity children are over-represented in the care system and constitute a significant group of those seeking adoption placements. Social workers are presented with a specific set of concerns in seeking to find adoption placements for mixed ethnicity children as they come from two or more cultural backgrounds. Practitioners face uncertain principles concerning how to respond to these issues, especially in light of social and political pressures, and within the realm of existing debates around 'transracial' adoption. There is a danger that among these uncertainties the individuality of the child will be lost as his or her identity needs become viewed narrowly. Social workers may seek to simplify and classify the identities of mixed ethnicity children in the adoption process through pressures that they feel to find 'matched' placements. This paper explores how theories concerning identity can provide some insight into the difficulties practitioners face and may help to inform social work practice in this area.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Context: Despite calls to make family planning services more responsive to the values, needs and preferences of clients, few studies have asked clients about their experiences or values, and most have used surveys framed by researchers', rather than clients', perspectives. Methods: Forty in-depth interviews exploring lifetime experiences with and values regarding services were conducted with 18-36-year-old women who visited family planning clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2007. Women were categorized as black, white, English- or Spanish-speaking Latina, or of mixed ethnicity to allow examination of differences by racial, ethnic and language group. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and coded thematically; matrices were then used to compare the themes that emerged across the subgroups. Results: Eight themes emerged as important to women's views of services: service accessibility, information provision, attention to client comfort, providers' personalization of care, service organization, providers' empathy, technical quality of care and providers' respect for women's autonomy. Women reported that it was important to feel comfortable during visits, to feel that their decision-making autonomy was respected, to have providers show empathy and be nonjudgmental, and to see the same provider across visits. The only notable difference among racial, ethnic and language groups was that Spanish-speaking Latinas wanted to receive language-appropriate care and contraceptive information. Conclusions: Future surveys of family planning service quality should include measures of the factors that women value in such care, and efforts to improve providers' communication and counseling skills should emphasize the personalization of services and respect for clients' autonomy.

A sample of 131 women of mixed ethnicity from inner-city Boston who were living in transitional housing participated in a 4-week pre/post measurement design. Results showed that, despite the short duration of the intervention, participants self reported significantly more use of safe sex behaviors and being prepared for sexual intimacy after the intervention.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Epilepsy is poorly understood by the public and has been associated with numerous myths. This, coupled with its sometimes dramatic clinical manifestations, has often resulted in stigmatization of persons with epilepsy. A questionnaire to measure knowledge of, attitudes toward, and perceptions of epilepsy (KAPE) was adapted from previous studies and administered to students of the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago. The response rate was 91% (355 students). Knowledge was limited, especially with respect to epilepsy's cause, its incidence, and management of an acute emergency. Attitudes toward epilepsy were generally positive. Students who knew someone with epilepsy scored significantly higher on knowledge and attitude questions. A stigma score was calculated to assess perceived stigmatization. There were no differences between the genders, but persons from rural areas and persons of mixed ethnicity perceived less stigmatization. Hindus perceived greater stigmatization than people of other religions. Overall, students still feel persons with epilepsy are discriminated against and experience stigmatization.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine Army women's condom use patterns, reasons for condom use and nonuse, and what is liked about and problems associated with condom use. Methods: Army women (n = 131) from military posts around the country were recruited. The women ranged in age from 18 to 68 years (M = 30.5, SD = 10.5). The sample was of mixed ethnicity. Questionnaires were distributed by the units and returned directly to the principal investigator. Participants completed a series of anonymous open- and closed-ended questions regarding their experiences with condoms. Closed-ended questions were analyzed with descriptive statistics and open-ended responses were content analyzed (McLaughlin & Marascuilo, 1990). Conclusions: Regular condom use was low in this sample. The most often cited responses as to why women liked using condoms included peace of mind, protection, or ease of use. The most cited problems and subsequent disuse included irritation/inflammation, breakage, improper fit, or ruining the moment. Results differed by consistency of condom use. Regular users of condoms reported a lower percentage of problems using condoms.

Thus there is a need for a better understanding of group development in social group work. This study examines the applicability of the Boston model for the stages of group development from the social worker's perspective. The Boston model is a prominent model of group development in social work. This study is a quantitative study that used an internet survey to question members from the Association for the Advancement of Social Work with Groups about the developmental pathway of their groups. The factors that influence the development of closed-ended groups such as gender and oppression status of group members were investigated. The data were analyzed by the use of chi-square and logistical regression (Weinbacht & Grinnell, 2001). The findings suggest that certain groups were more likely to develop along the lines of the Boston model. These groups included those who were considered by the group workers surveyed to be predominantly oppressed and of low income, as well as groups predominantly non-white and of mixed ethnicity. Future studies should consider expanding the study population to include other groups of social workers.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: We aimed to determine the frequency of all known forms of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) in a large Australasian cohort. Methods: We screened 101 patients with CMD with a combination of immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and DNA sequencing to identify disease-associated abnormalities in glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan, collagen VI, laminin alpha2, alpha7-integrin, and selenoprotein. Results: A total of 45% of the CMD cohort were assigned to an immunofluorescent subgroup based on their abnormal staining pattern. Abnormal staining for glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan was present in 25% of patients, and approximately half of these had reduced glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan by Western blot. Sequencing of the FKRP, fukutin, POMGnT1, and POMT1 genes in all patients with abnormal alpha-dystroglycan immunofluorescence identified mutations in one patient for each of these genes and two patients had mutations in POMT2. Twelve percent of patients had abnormalities in collagen VI immunofluorescence, and we identified disease-causing COL6 mutations in eight of nine patients in whom the genes were sequenced. Laminin alpha2 deficiency accounted for only 8% of CMD. alpha7-Integrin staining was absent in 12 of 45 patients studied, and ITGA7 gene mutations were excluded in all of these patients. Conclusions: We define the distribution of different forms of congenital muscular dystrophy in a large cohort of mixed ethnicity and demonstrate the utility and limitations of current diagnostic techniques.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The latency to withdrawal (LTW) is the expired time between the last cigarette and when the smoker feels the need to smoke again. The sensitization-homeostasis theory predicts that the LTW is inversely related to the frequency and duration of smoking such that more frequent cigarette consumption and a longer history of tobacco use will be associated with a shorter LTW. An anonymous cross-sectional survey of 1055 10th and 11th grade students of mixed ethnicity was conducted in two schools using self-completed questionnaires. Participants were asked ""After you have smoked a cigarette, how long can you go before you feel you need to smoke again?"" Of 162 current smokers, 73.5% reported a regular need to smoke and a LTW. Reported values for the LTW ranged from .05 h to ""3 weeks or more."" Monthly cigarette consumption ranged from 1 to 895. The LTW correlated inversely with monthly cigarette consumption (Kendall's tau b = -.53, P < .001) and the duration of smoking (Kendall's tau b = -.25, P < .001) as predicted by the sensitization-homeostasis theory.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: A study, entitled Evaluation of an Intervention Aimed at Resolving Behavioural Sleep Problems in 6- to 12-month-old Infants: A Pilot Study, was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a behavioural sleep intervention. This descriptive qualitative study aimed to describe parents' perceptions of the sleep intervention and any burden associated with participating in the study. Methods: Fourteen of the 35 families who had participated in the quantitative study were interviewed. Respondents comprised well-educated, middle-class and mixed-ethnicity families. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, with open-ended trigger questions, and were analysed using inductive content analysis. Result: Nine themes, which subsumed a number of categories, were constructed. Parents changed their perspectives about sleep and parenting styles; they experienced many challenges and inadvertent benefits; and they welcomed a structured framework for assisting with sleep problems. The parents fitted intervention strategies into their realities; many factors interfered with their success; and their support systems and their expectations of the study varied. Conclusion: These parents' previous education about normal infant sleep cycles and behavioural sleep problems was inadequate. The parents who were able to use the structured framework, flexible strategies and access to healthcare professionals for problem solving not only excelled in resolving their infants' sleep problems, but also gained confidence about their parenting skills and success.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: To determine among male adolescents whether bully-victims would report the poorest psychosocial health, the worst attitudes toward school, more problem behavior (delinquency, weapons possession, and substance use), and more physical injury compared with bullies, victims, and neutral students. We also assessed ethnic differences in bullying category membership. Methods: Employing multisample latent variable models, we contrasted 1,312 males in grades 7-12 classified as bullies (n = 299), victims (n = 180), bully-victims (n = 195), and neutral (n = 638) on school attitudes, psychosocial health, problem behaviors, and physical injury. Results: Hypotheses were generally confirmed, especially contrasts between bully-victims and neutrals. However, bullies did not have better school attitudes than bully-victims, and victims only marginally reported better psychological health than bully-victims. The boys of mixed ethnicity were more likely to be victims. Conclusions: Greater awareness of the problems associated with boys who both bully and are victimized is necessary for improved intervention.

The student population of this school was a Title I eligible elementary campus with students of mixed ethnicity. The purpose of the study was to document teachers' perceptions and understanding of the implementation process and those factors they perceived that inhibited and facilitated the implementation by an instructional coach of the Cognitive CoachingSM process. The method of inquiry was an instrumental case study at a single site that included a minimum of three one-on-one interviews with each of the eight participants. These interviews triangulated with historical data and observations provide the information to tell the story of the implementation process and extend the reader's understanding of the implementation process. The themes revealed in the research included: (1) lack of understanding and clarity of the Cognitive CoachingSM process, (2) influence of the campus leadership, (3) teacher's willingness or resistance to change educational practice, (4) relational trust, (5) influence on instructional change, and (6) increased student achievement. This research study offers implications for both practice and theory. There are specific implications for administrators, instructional coaches, principals, and teachers as they implement the Cognitive CoachingSM process. There is a need for clear, well-defined expectations for implementation at both the campus and district level. In addition, personnel responsible for the implementation process at the campus and district level must be trained in the Cognitive CoachingSM process. Teachers must be aware of the process and terminology pertinent to the implementation process. The Cognitive CoachingSM process provides the opportunity for teachers to restructure their educational practice as they to engage in professional dialogue and reflection with instructional coaches, principals, and peers. Further studies on the connection between relational trust and the implementation process, would provide educators and researchers a fuller understanding of the factors that support the process of implementing innovative reform models in schools.

As such, this quantitative study examined the effect of ethnic identity factors on individual marital satisfaction in 126 heterosexual French-Canadian/English-Canadian, dual-career, professional unions in Ontario. The sample was divided into eight comparison groups depending on their relationship makeup. Drawing upon independent research of interethnic, dominant/minority ethnicity, and gender differences in marital satisfaction (Carisse, 1971; Fu, Tora, & Kendall, 2001; Kurdek, 2005), the hypotheses for this study were that (a) both genders in same-ethnicity marriages will report higher levels of marital satisfaction as measured by the Dyadic Adjustment Scale than both genders in mixed-ethnicity marriages, and (b) English-Canadians will report higher levels of marital satisfaction as measured by the Dyadic Adjustment Scale than French-Canadians. English and French are Canada's two official languages and ethnicities, which are often referred to as racial, not just ethnocultural differences, despite Canadians' shared, nominally White, European origins. In Ontario, English Canadians enjoy the majority/dominant culture and language, and French Canadians the minority/nondominant culture and language. Overall, there was not a difference in marital satisfaction between individuals in same-ethnicity marriages (i.e., Groups 1, 4, 5, and 8) and individuals in mixed-ethnicity marriages (Groups 2, 3, 6, and 7). With regards to marital satisfaction, individuals from dominant culture ethnicity (Groups 3, 4, 7, and 8) reported lower levels of satisfaction than individuals with the nondominant culture ethnicity (Groups l, 2, 5, and 6), again only for dyadic consensus. In addition, the difference between dominant and non dominant culture males was larger than the difference between dominant and non dominant culture females, for the dyadic consensus scale. When the level of ethnic identity between French Canadians and English Canadians was considered, it appeared that there was a difference between levels of identity. This level of ethnic identity was related to marital satisfaction.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Research has sought to understand how environmental factors influence adolescent physical activity, yet little is known about where and with whom adolescents are physically active. Purpose: This study used electronic ecological momentary assessment (e.EMA) to map the social and physical contexts of exercise and walking across adolescence. Differences in physical activity contexts by gender, grade in school, day of the week, and season were examined. Methods: Twice a year between 9th and 12th grade, 502 adolescents (51% female) of mixed ethnicity (55% White) participated in 4-day e.EMA intervals (Thursday-Sunday) where their primary activity (e.g., exercise, TV, homework), social company (e.g., friends, family, class), and physical location (e.g., home, school, outdoors) were assessed every 30 (+/-10) min during waking hours. Results: Overall, greater proportions of exercise and walking were reported with friends, outdoors, and at school. However, boys were more likely to report exercising and walking in outdoor locations than girls. Exercising with classmates, family, and at school decreased across high school. Walking with family, friends, and outdoors also decreased. On weekdays compared to weekends, students reported a greater proportion of their exercise and walking at school. Students were more likely to report exercising and walking outdoors in the fall and the spring than in the winter. Conclusion: e.EMA showed that the social and physical contexts of adolescent exercise and walking vary as a function of gender, grade in school, day of the week, and season. Understanding the contexts of physical activity during the high school years can be helpful in designing interventions during adolescence.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: The natural intervention of a new light-rail stop in a neighborhood is examined for relationships with ridership and moderate-activity bouts. Design: At Time 1, surveys and 1-week accelerometer readings assess transit use and moderate-activity bouts. One year later (Time 2), after the opening of a new light-rail stop, measures were repeated. Setting/Participants: During the summers of 2005 and 2006, 51 residents participated from a low-income, mixed ethnicity neighborhood in Salt Lake City, Utah. Intervention: A new light-rail stop was built and opened in the middle of the surveyed neighborhood. Main Outcome Measures: Physical activity was measured as a bout of 8 or more minutes of moderate activity (3.0 metabolic units [METS]), according to accelerometer counts, controlling for hours worn. Prompted recalls allowed moderate-activity bouts to be labeled as walks to transit or not. Results: Analyses in 2006-2007 show that the percentage of rail riders increased significantly, from 50% to 68.75%, after the stop opened. In cross-sectional analyses at Times 1 and 2, self-reported rides on light rail were significantly related to more moderate-activity bouts, controlling for gender, household size, and home ownership. Longitudinally, with the same control variables and adding Time 1 moderate activity, light-rail rides at Time 2 predicted increased Time 2 moderate activity. Conclusions: A new rail stop was associated with increased ridership. Walks to light rail were associated, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with moderate-activity bouts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article analyses gaps in the university graduation rates of third-generation Ashkenazim and Mizrahim (the two major ethnic groups among Israeli Jews), in comparison to the same gaps among members of the second generation. The empirical analyses have been performed using a special file of the 1995 Israeli census which matched records of respondents to their parents in the 1983 Census, thereby allowing identification of the ethnicity of the third generation for a representative sample of men and women, 25-34 years of age in 1995, as well as the identification of persons of mixed ethnicity. The results suggest that the gaps between the two major ethnic groups are not smaller in the third generation than in the second generation. Persons of mixed ethnicity-of both the second and third generations-are located about midway between the two ethnic groups with respect to their university graduation rates. Much of the ethnic-based gap in university graduation is due to differences in family background, especially among women. We discuss the implications of these results for the future of ethnic-based stratification in Israel.

Participants were 78 (34 male, 44 female) preschool children of mixed ethnicity who were between three to five years of age. All subjects completed four tasks that assessed false-belief understanding, deceptive ability, deception detection ability, and peer acceptance. Results from the four-way repeated measures mixed-model analysis of variance (2 Gender x 3 Age x 2 False-Belief Understanding x 2 Deception) suggest that there is a task effect, age effect, gender effect, and false-belief understanding effect for deception among preschool children. Children received significantly higher scores on the deception detection ability task than they did on the deceptive ability task. This indicates that young children find deception detection to be easier than deceptive ability. In addition, this also provides evidence that deceptive ability and that deception detection are two separate constructs. This is further supported by the principal components analysis, which extracted two separate components for deception intelligence. In addition, three-year-old children perform significantly lower than four- and five-year-old children on deception tasks. However, there is not a significant difference between the performances of four- and five-year-old children on deception tasks. This supports previous research that four years of age appears to be the critical age for the emergence of Machiavellian Intelligence (Peskin, 1992; Peterson, 2003). Moreover, males perform significantly better on deception tasks than females. Furthermore, there is a significant positive correlation between deception detection ability and peer acceptance. Children who obtain higher deception detection ability scores are ranked as being more liked by their peers.

The purpose of this project was to focus on the impact parents have on their children's cross-race relationships. Adolescents' perceptions of parents' messages about these relationships were examined to investigate how this related to the extent of contact with peers from different ethnic backgrounds and the extent to which it impacted adolescents' subsequent evaluations of cross-race relationships. Participants were 347 ninth- and twelfth-graders of mixed ethnicity and across gender. Three factors were proposed to influence their attitudes toward cross-race relationships: perception of intergroup contact, perception of parents' racial attitudes, and perception of parents' messages. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: (1) Intergroup Contact Measure, (2) Cross-Race Friendship and Dating Experiences, (3) Parental Attitudes, and (4) Personal Attitudes and Autonomy. The Intergroup Contact section asked demographic questions regarding the racial make-up and chance at interaction with individuals from a different racial background. The second section, Social Experiences, asked questions regarding the participant's experience with cross-race friendships and romantic relationships. The third section, Parental Attitudes, assessed the participant's perception of his or her parents' attitudes toward cross-race relationships. The fourth section of the survey, Evaluations of Parental and Personal Attitudes, asked participants their opinion on who should make rules for adolescents' dating and friendship choices. Findings indicated that perceptions of intergroup contact had an effect on the formation and development of both cross-race friendships and dating relationships. Perceptions of parent racial attitudes had an effect on the actual experiences participants had within their cross-race relationships. In addition, the findings indicated that parents evaluated cross-race relationships differently and their messages played a key role in shaping the experiences of their children. These findings both contribute and expand on existing literature about adolescent social relationships and theories of prejudice and racial bias, providing further support to intergroup contact theory.

The goals of the Interactive Problem Solving (IPS) method are to reduce prejudicial attitudes and increase transference. The present study evaluated whether a simulation of the IPS method reduces prejudicial attitudes and increases both transference and empathy by comparing the IPS method to a Discussion method, which was a control condition which focused primarily on the mutual interests of the groups in conflict. One-hundred and eighty Indian-American and Pakistani-American undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a mixed-ethnicity, same-sex dyad. A third-party facilitator, who was the same sex as the dyad members, was randomly assigned to each dyad. The facilitator led the dyad in a simulated discussion about the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan using a randomly assigned conflict management method (i.e., IPS method or Discussion method). Pre-tests and post-tests were administered before and after the discussion and a follow-up questionnaire was emailed three weeks later. The first hypothesis was tested and supported. The IPS method condition, compared to the Discussion method condition, led to more decrease in prejudicial attitudes toward the opposing party. The second hypothesis investigated transference, which is the extent to which the participants engage in reading, thinking, and communicating about the Kashmir conflict, the workshop, or the opposing party. It was tested and supported the hypothesis and found that the IPS method participants demonstrated higher transference than the Discussion method participants. The third hypothesis was assessed and supported. The IPS method participants had higher empathy than the Discussion method participants over time. Finally, two supplemental hypotheses to Hypothesis III were tested and supported. Regarding the first supplemental hypothesis, in both methods, as participants' empathy increased, their prejudicial attitudes decreased. The result of the second supplemental hypothesis was that as the participants' empathy increased, their transference increased. For both hypotheses, the relationships were stronger in the IPS method condition than the Discussion method condition. The findings of the present study extended the evaluation research on the IPS method. Implications for evaluation research on the IPS method are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: To investigate weight perception, dieting and emotional well being across the range of body mass index (BMI) in a population-based multiethnic sample of early adolescents. Design: Cross-sectional population-based survey. Subjects: In total, 2789 adolescents 11-14 years of age from three highly deprived regional authorities in East London, in 2001. Measurements: Data were collected by student-completed questionnaire on weight perception, dieting history, mental and physical health, health behaviours, social capital and sociodemographic factors. Height and weight were measured by trained researchers. Overweight was defined as BMI >85th centile and obesity as BMI >98th centile. Underweight was defined as BMI <15th centile. Results: In all, 73% were from ethnic groups other than white British. Valid BMI were available for 2522 subjects (90.4%) of whom 14% were obese. Only 20% of overweight boys and 51% of overweight girls assessed their weight accurately. Accuracy of weight perception did not vary between ethnic groups. In all, 42% of girls and 26% of boys reported current dieting to lose weight. Compared with white British teenagers, a history of dieting was more common among Bangladeshi, Indian and mixed ethnicity boys and less likely among Pakistani girls. Self-esteem was not associated with BMI in girls but was significantly lower in obese boys than those of normal weight (P = 0.02). Within ethnic subgroups, self-esteem was significantly lower in overweight white British boys (P = 0.03) and obese Bangladeshi boys (P = 0.01) and Bangladeshi girls (P = 0.04), but significantly higher in obese black African girls (P = 0.01) than those of normal weight. Obese young people had a higher prevalence of psychological distress (P = 0.04), except among Bangladeshi teenagers, where overweight and obese young people had less psychological distress than those of normal weight (P = 0.02). Birth outside the UK was associated with reduced risk of obesity in girls (P = 0.02) but not with history of dieting, weight perception or psychological factors in either gender. Conclusion: High levels of current dieting for weight control and inaccurate perception of body mass are common across all ethnic groups. However, dieting history and the associations of obesity with self-esteem and psychological distress vary between ethnic groups. Interventions to prevent or treat obesity in black or minority ethnicity groups must consider cultural differences in the relationship between body mass, self-esteem and psychological distress.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The study examined predictors of gender role stereotypes for a sample of 121 Israeli adolescents aged 14 to 17. Specifically, the contribution of three sets of variables was tested: background variables, parental factors, and adolescents' personality traits (self-esteem and tolerance for ambiguity). The findings indicated that the background variables contributed more than the other types of variables toward predicting adolescents' gender role perceptions. Adolescent boys expressed more stereotyped gender role perceptions than adolescent girls. In addition, the older the adolescents, the less stereotyped their perceptions appeared to be. The contribution of ethnicity was also found statistically significant: adolescents of Asian-African background tended to have more stereotyped gender role perceptions than their counterparts of European-American or mixed ethnicity. As for the intergenerational transmission of stereotypes, the mothers' gender role stereotypes were found to be more statistically significant predictors than the fathers' gender role stereotypes: mothers transmitted stereotypes equally to sons and daughters, whereas fathers influenced daughters more than sons. Finally, adolescents' personality traits were found to contribute significantly toward predicting their gender role stereotypes: the greater the adolescents' self-esteem and tolerance for ambiguity, the less stereotyped their gender role perceptions appeared to be.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: The prevalence rates of disorders among a community-based sample of Hawaiian youths were determined and compared to previously published epidemiological studies. Method: Using a two-phase design, 7,317 adolescents were surveyed (60% participation rate), from which 619 were selected in a modified random sample during the 1992-1993 to 1995-1996 school years: 590 selected randomly and 29 at risk (i.e., Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression score of >35 and suicidal risk) from grades 9-12. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version 2.3, was used to determine DSM-III-R diagnoses. Prevalence rates, weighted for ethnicity, Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scores, and suicide attempts, were calculated for any diagnosis and various disorders. Meta-analyses compared the Hawai'i sample to four community-based studies (randomly selected youths from community populations) and two high-risk studies (homeless, low-income, or high unemployment communities). Results: Hawaiian females had the highest rate for any diagnosis (37.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 28.4%-48.0%) and non-Hawaiian males had the lowest rate (19.6%; 95% CI 14.8%-25.5%). Hawaiian males (26.8%; 95% CI 18.2%-37.5%) and non-Hawaiian females (27.9%; 95% CI 22.2%-34.4%) had intermediate and comparable rates. Overall, Hawaiians had significantly higher rates (32.7%; 95% CI 26.1%-40.1%) than non-Hawaiians (23.7%; 95% CI 19.9%-28.0%) when controlling for gender, and girls had significantly higher rates (30.8%; 95% CI 25.8%-36.3%) than boys (21.1%; 95% CI 16.8%-26.1%) when controlling for ethnicity. These findings were primarily the result of the significant differences in rates regarding anxiety disorders. Meta-analyses showed the Hawaiian youth rate for any diagnosis was comparable to high-risk studies and nearly three times higher than the community studies. Conclusions: Hawaiian youths, especially females, are at high risk. Research on the sociocultural factors that underpin both the genesis of and protection from psychopathology is imperative for Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian mixed-ethnicity youths.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study examined predictors of gender role stereotypes among a sample of 121 Israeli adolescents aged 13-17. Specifically, the contribution of three sets of variables was tested: background variables, parental factors, and adolescents' personality traits (self-esteem and tolerance for ambiguity). The findings indicate that background variables contributed most toward predicting adolescents' gender role types. The adolescent boys expressed more stereotyped gender role perceptions than did the girls. In addition, the older the adolescents, the less stereotyped their perceptions. The contribution of ethnicity was also found to be significant: adolescents of Asian-African background tended to have more stereotyped gender role perceptions than did their counterparts of mixed ethnicity. As for intergenerational transmission of stereotypes, mothers' gender role stereotypes were found to be more significant predictors than fathers' stereotypes: mothers transmitted stereotypes equally to sons and daughters, whereas fathers influenced their daughters more than their sons. Finally, adolescents' personality traits contributed significantly toward predicting their gender role stereotypes: the higher the adolescents' self-esteem and the greater their tolerance for ambiguity, the less stereotyped their gender role perceptions.

The sample consisted of 44 maltreated and 56 nonmaltreated children (females = 51) of mixed ethnicity. Subjects were administered a 20-item measure of attributional processes. The results indicated that relative to nonmaltreated children, physically abused boys were more likely to attribute hostile intentions to a variety of relationship figures, including their parents, an unfamiliar teacher, their best friend, and unfamiliar peers. A positive relation was also found between the frequency of physical abuse and hostile attributional tendencies among males. Finally, support was found for the role of children's hostile attributions of their mothers in mediating the relation between physical abuse and children's hostile attributions of unfamiliar peers. The results support a link between physical abuse and hostile attributional tendencies in children in early elementary school.

Children were interviewed to test hypotheses about implicit racial biases, perceptions of similarity between peer dyads, and judgments about cross-race friendships. Implicit racial biases emerged when children evaluated ambiguous picture cards, with children viewing a White child as more likely to be a transgressor than a Black child in certain situations. There were no racial biases when evaluating potential cross-race friendship (it was judged to be feasible); nor was there any evidence of an outgroup homogeneity effect. Children who used ethnicity as a reason for judging peers to be similar, however, were less likely to judge that the cross-race dyads could be friends. The findings indicate the ways in which minority children's judgments about the majority and their perceptions of similarity between peer dyads influence their interpretations of peer interactions.

Youth (N = 7506; 46% male; 11-14 years old) completed surveys on their intentions to use alcohol-related services, beliefs about services, previous use of services, and substance use. Students who reported stronger positive beliefs reported greater intentions to use services. Girls, younger students, and whites also reported stronger interest in using services than boys, older students, and youth of mixed ethnicity, respectively. Adolescents who reported current use of substances were less willing to use prevention services. Current research highlights the importance of creating prevention services for this age group that are developmentally relevant and that focus on features that will attract youth, such as utilizing an interactive discussion format. Beginning to understand what motivates adolescents to seek help can facilitate the creation of better prevention programs.

Understanding the influence of diversity is particularly important for organizations that rely on team-based work structures, where individuals must engage in face-to-face interactions more frequently than in other organizational settings. The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of gender and ethnic diversity on team member interactions when performing a highly interdependent task that is both cognitively and behaviorally challenging. Participants were composed of 264 undergraduate students who enrolled in psychology courses at Florida International University and formed 66, 4-person teams. Teams participated in a low fidelity F-22 flight simulation consisting of two aircraft that had to interact in order to be successful. A 2 x 2 design was utilized in which the gender and ethnicity composition of each team was manipulated to form four experimental conditions (same gender/same ethnicity, same gender/mixed ethnicity, mixed gender/same ethnicity, mixed gender/mixed ethnicity). Both ethnic and gender homogeneity in teams resulted in increased interpersonal cohesion. Moreover, coordination fully mediated the relationship between interpersonal cohesion and team performance. Higher levels of interpersonal cohesion enhanced coordination between team members, which ultimately improved performance. Implications of these findings are discussed, as are limitations of the study and suggestions for future research.

The purpose of the study was to look at whether these relationships would also hold for relational aggression. Further, a short-term longitudinal study tested whether relational aggression could predict popularity (liking) and friendship stability and mutuality two months in the future. Participants were 74 boys and girls (ages 5 and 6; 35% Caucasian, 22% Asian/Pacific Islanders, 16% Latino/Hispanic, 8% African American, 19% mixed ethnicity or ""other"") enrolled in private preschool programs; 52 of these also participated in time 2 assessments. The Preschool Social Behavior Scale (PSBS) peer and teacher forms (Crick et al., 1997) measured relational aggression and overt aggression. Teacher and peer reports of relational and overt aggression showed good internal consistency at both time 1 and time 2 (alphas ranged from .88 to .94). The time 1-time 2 test-retest correlations for peer nominations of relational aggression and overt aggression were .74 and .84 respectively. Popularity (liking) was measured using Denham and Holt's (1993) method in which children placed pictures of each participating child into boxes labeled with smiling, frowning and neutral faces based on how much they hiked each child. Consistent with previous research, test-retest reliability was good (.71). Number of mutual friends was assessed by asking each child to select pictures of participating classmates they considered to be friends; if both children selected each other, they were considered ""mutual friends."" Friendship stability was indexed by the number of mutual friends at time 1 who also met the criteria for mutual friendship at time 2. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to test the relationship between relational aggression and the friendship variables. Results showed that peer nominations of relational aggression were negatively related to time 1 liking, time 1 number of mutual friends, and friendship stability even when teacher ratings of overt aggression were controlled. Overt aggression was also significantly related to these variables. Further, relational aggression significantly predicted the number of mutual friendships and liking two months later (controlling for initial levels of these variables). Gender did not interact with relational aggression in predicting any of these variables. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

More specifically, this study investigated the validity of micro worry (i.e. worry about personal concerns) and macro worry (i.e. worry about broader societal issues) constructs and their relationship to clinical conceptualizations of worry. It was expected that micro worry would be correlated with negative indicators of mental health and personal well being while macro worry would be correlated with positive indicators of these variables. It was also expected that the micro worry construct would be positively correlated with measures of clinical worry. The construct of value concordance (i.e. the disparity between a participant's endorsement of a value type on the PCVS from the sample mean) was also investigated. It was expected that the endorsement of highly discordant values would be related to negative indicators of mental health and personal well being. Furthermore, this latter effect was predicted to be influenced by ethnicity with value concordance effects predicted to be stronger for African American participants. Participants were college students of whom 55 were African American women and 67 White American women; male participants included 48 African Americans and 36 White Americans. Correlations in the predicted direction were obtained between micro worries and self-report measures of positive and negative affect, general mental health status, and life satisfaction. Contrary to expectations, correlations between macro worry and the same self-report measures were either not obtained or inconsistent with predictions. As expected, correlations between micro worry on the Micro Macro Worries Scale (MMWS) and two other self-report measures of worry derived and validated in a clinical treatment context were found. Significant effects were discovered for value discordance with self-report measures of macro worry and positive affect. In reference to interaction between ethnicity and value discordance, it was found that: (a) African Americans low in discordance for the value of stimulation report less worry and those high in stimulation discordance report less life satisfaction, (b) White Americans low in discordance for the stimulation value type report more worry, (c) White Americans high in discordance for the self-direction value type report poorer mental health while African Americans high in self-direction discordance report greater mental health, (d) White Americans low in discordance for the tradition value type report more life satisfaction and those high in tradition discordance report less positive affect. Other findings provided no support for the mediating effects of stress on ethnocultural differences in reported distress and symptoms. Differences between African American and White Americans were significant in individual values, worry, subjective well being, and general mental health status.

Using shared reality theory (Hardin & Conley, 2000; Hardin & Higgins, 1996), which posits that interpersonal relationships are built upon commonly held attitudes and beliefs, it was predicted that positive relationships with same-ethnicity others will elicit high ethnic identification but that positive relationships with different-ethnicity others will elicit lower ethnic identification. In this study, 112 Asian-American women (66 from same-ethnicity marriages, 46 from mixed-ethnicity marriages) were instructed to think of the positive aspects of either their relationship with their spouse or their relationship with their mother. Women in mixed-ethnicity marriages thinking about their different-ethnicity spouse reported lower ethnic identification on the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992), compared to women in mixed-ethnicity marriages thinking about their mother and to women in same-ethnicity marriages thinking about their mother or their spouse. Greater shared understanding of ethnicity with mother accounted for the higher levels of ethnic identification reported by women in mixed-ethnicity marriages thinking about their mother compared to women in mixed-ethnicity marriages thinking about their spouse. Greater shared understanding of ethnicity with spouse accounted for the higher levels of ethnic identification reported by women in same-ethnicity marriages compared to women in mixed-ethnicity marriages.

Inter-ethnic unions comprise around 2.7% of all unions in the USA and 1.3% in Britain and are increasing. The impact of these changes on the ethnic/racial diversity of Britain and North America and the demand from persons of mixed race to describe their 'full' identity requires a response from government and Census agencies that classify the population by race/ethnicity. Research show that the self-understandings of persons of mixed race may incorporate a range of identities, some biracial and others a single group like 'black', although the options available in the USA may still be limited by the legacy of the hypodescent policy. The solutions offered by classifications in the 2000/2001 round of censuses include a subdivided 'mixed' category in England and Wales and provision to select one or more categories in the USA. This marks an end to the official conceptualisation of 'pure' races that has been so pervasive in the past and, for the first time, offers mixed race identity to those of mixed heritage.

Hyman, Zelikoff, and Clarke (1988) found that the criteria with which children exhibited PTSD symptoms as a result of ""disciplinary"" actions, which occurred within the school day, were not outside the realm of normal experiences. They suggested that further studies address children's worst school experiences to assess the extent to which school personnel induced stress related symptoms. This study sampled students from sixth through twelfth grades from a mixed ethnicity, low to middle class urban school district and assessed the level of stress symptomatology they experienced after their worst school experience. The My Worst School Experience Scale (MWSES), a self-report measure that ask children to rate behaviors, thoughts, and feelings they may have experienced after a traumatic event, was used to make comparisons of traumatic events. The findings indicate that students who were classified as learning disabled (receiving Special Education services) had higher maladjustment scores as compared to their non-classified peers (in Regular Education). The groups did not differ in stress symptoms and none met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD. These findings corroborate those of Snook (2000) where experiences outside of school are significantly more likely to cause stress symptoms than those in school. As predicted, a teacher caused 51.3% of the worst school experiences reported by students with learning disabilities and 42.9% of experiences reported by the non-classified children. Similar to findings reported by Snook (2000) 23.3% of worst school experiences reported by the Special Education group and 36.8% of experiences reported by the Regular Education group involved a peer (i.e., teasing, fighting, lying, harassing, etc.). It is important for school personnel and students to have a positive and pleasant environment within the school building. Therefore, it is helpful to be able to assess the school environment by the use of normative scales, such as the MWSES, to assess when the stress symptoms are severe enough to reach the level of PTSD.

Retrospective review of clinical data ascertained from the Stanford Sleep Inventory, polysomnography and Multiple Sleep Latency Test data, as well as clinical notes were used. The authors compared the severity and clinical presentation of narcolepsy in 64 African Americans, 353 Caucasians, 32 Asians, 26 Latinos, and 9 Ss of mixed ethnicity. Ss were recruited through the Stanford center for narcolepsy research. A striking similarity in symptomatology, age of onset, and disease severity was found across ethnic groups. Mean age of onset for sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and cataplexy were 19-23 years old. Results found that narcoleptic patients have slightly but significantly elevated body mass index relative to normative data and are born slightly more frequently during the month of March.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Notes that access to health care in the US is a function of many variables, including income, education, health insurance coverage (HIC), and ethnicity. This chapter briefly discusses the barriers associated with access to HIC and how this gateway to health care is associated with alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence (IPV). Specifically, the chapter examines the empirical data on HIC for treatment for IPV and alcoholism among ethnic Americans. An analysis of the 1995 Couples Study, comprising a total of 1,599 Black, Hispanic, White, and mixed ethnicity (in which the ethnicities of the partners did not match) heterosexual couples, is presented. Ss were interviewed about their demographic characteristics, alcohol consumption patterns, HIC, and the occurrence of 11 IPV behaviors. Results suggest that barriers to minority health care exist and are particularly prevalent among US Hispanics. Income was the most important factor in determining HIC status. Results suggest that minority couples who are affected by alcohol problems, including alcohol-related IPV, will be less likely to find the appropriate care to solve their problems. It is suggested that the inequality in access to care is likely to further contribute to the disparity in IPV across ethnic groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions for women in the USA. 24 articles from 1989 to 1997 were included. The authors evaluated 5 ethnic groupings (All Ethnicities Combined, African-American, White, Hispanic and a Mixed Ethnicity group) over 4 time periods (post-test, less than 2 mo after the intervention, 2-3 mo after the intervention and 6-24 mo after the intervention) on 3 HIV-related sexuality outcome variables (HIV/AIDS knowledge, self-efficacy and sexual risk reduction behavior). The HIV interventions appear effective at improving knowledge about HIV/AIDS and increasing sexual risk reduction behaviors for all ethnicities examined at all follow-up periods, with one exception. The findings for self-efficacy are less consistent. The interventions were less consistently effective for African-American women, for whom significant improvements in feelings of self-efficacy were only seen 6 mo or longer after the intervention. The present analysis elucidates ethnic differences which may have previously been obscured while demonstrating convincingly that HIV interventions are generally effective for women of many different ethnicities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Although the use of focus group methodology is increasing in social science research, few empirical evaluations of this method are found in the literature. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the utility of focus groups as a research method. We present a study in which a mixed-ethnicity sample of 44 men, ages 18-43 years, participated in both an individual interview and a focus group discussion covering 4 identical topics related to intimate and sexual relationships. Although both methods generated similar conclusions, a greater range and richness-depth of themes were present in the individual setting. However, dynamic interactions in the focus group setting provided insight beyond the content themes. Theories of small group dynamics are used to discuss our findings.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article focuses on the ethnic identity of children in Belize. Belizean nationalism, as taught in the primary schools, is both pan-ethnic and multiethnic. However, because the increasingly widespread practice of ethnic mixing is unacknowledged, there is a discrepancy between what is taught in school and the daily life of children.The overt intent is to recognize and celebrate difference; however, the result has been to silence children's voices. Children, primarily between ages 7 and 11, and teachers were interviewed concerning ethnic identity over 2 school years. Tests, drawings, and papers in which notions of ethnicity were a part were collected. Classes were observed everyday. Teachers reported that 68 out of 230 were of mixed ethnicity. In day-to-day circumstances of school, teachers did not label children by more than 1 ethnic group. 58 out of 68 of the ethnically mixed Ss were interviewed. The results are (1) 10 Ss identified themselves as 2 ethnic groups, (2) 5 Ss said they were mixed without specifying an ethnic group, (3) 39 Ss chose a single ethnic label, and (4) 4 remaining Ss said ""I don't know."" No clear pattern emerged that could predict what ethnic identity a child of mixed ethnicity would choose.

Ss comprised 804 academically talented students (mean age 14.54 yrs) of Asian- American, White, Hispanic, African-American, American-Indian, or mixed ethnicity. Ss attending a summer enrichment program completed questionnaires regarding internally and externally focused reasons for choosing a course. Results show that male Ss enrolled in traditionally male (TM) courses in significantly greater numbers than they enrolled in traditionally female (TF) courses; female enrollment in the 2 types of courses was more evenly distributed. Asian-American Ss' course enrollment in TM and TF courses was more balanced than enrollments by non-Asian American Ss, and Asian-American Ss endorsed fewer internal reasons than did non-Asian Americans. Ss in TM classes endorsed more external reasons for course choice than did Ss in TF classes. Ss who gave more internal reasons for course choice reported enjoying classes more than did Ss who gave more external reasons. No differences were observed concerning the effect of gender on motivation.

The 13 sites were divided into 4 ethnic strata, within which only YMSM of 1 of the following ethnic backgrounds were recruited: African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and mixed ethnicity. Results show that 22% of Ss reported that their last sexual contact with their main sexual partner, someone other than a main sexual partner, or both involved unprotected anal intercourse. Ss from Asian/Pacific Islander sites, mixed sites, and Hispanic sites were more likely than Ss from African American sites to report unprotected anal intercourse. Within the mixed sites, Hispanic Ss, followed by Asian/Pacific Islander and White Ss, were more likely than African American Ss to report unprotected anal intercourse. It is concluded that interventions are needed that are responsive to the racial/ethnic differences in HIV risk behaviors of YMSM throughout urban American cities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Explored differences in the self-reported drug use and exposure to drugs of an ethnically diverse group of 408 7th-grade students from a large city in the southwest. The authors contrast the explanatory power of ethnic labels (African American, non-Hispanic White, Mexican American, and mixed ethnicity) and 2 dimensions of ethnic identity in predicting drug use. One dimension focuses on perceived ethnically consistent behavior, speech, and looks, while the other gauges a sense of ethnic pride. Ethnic labels were found to be somewhat useful in identifying differences in drug use. In conjunction, ethnic labels and ethnic entity measures explained far more of the differences in drug use than either did alone. The 2 dimensions of ethnic identity predicted drug outcomes in opposite ways, and these relations were different for minority students and non-Hispanic White students. Generally, African American, Mexican American, and mixed-ethnicity students with a strong sense of ethnic pride reported less drug use and exposure, while ethnically proud White students reported more. Ethnic minority students who viewed their behavior, speech, and looks as consistent with their ethnic group reported more drug use and exposure, while their White counterparts reported less.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Investigated how children use directives and forms of exclusion to organize play activity. Elementary school children of mixed ethnicity were observed playing the game of jump rope over the span of 1 mo. Girls' dominance in the game was observed to change over time. In mixed-sex groups where boys were learning how to jump, girls frequently set the agenda regarding how the game was to be played. However, as boys gained proficiency in the game, they became equal partners in calling plays and making decisions. Rather than finding differences in directive forms related to gender, the author found that the ability to use actions that tell others what to do in a very direct fashion in cross-sex interaction changes over time as children become more skilled in the activity.

Specifically, the present study established norms for the adolescent population for the Student Social Support Scale (SSSS; Nolten, 1994). The SSSS has proven to be a sound instrument in measuring children's perceptions of social support, with high levels of reliability and validity. The SSSS measures emotional, informational, appraisal, and instrumental forms of support provided by parents, teachers, close friends, and classmates. Additionally, an exploration of possible ethnic and gender differences was conducted. The research participants of this study consisted of a multiethnic sample of 191 ninth-, tenth-, eleventh-, and twelfth-grade students from four high schools (public and private) in the Chicagoland area. Overall, the preliminary analyses suggested that the SSSS is a valid and reliable measure of perceived social support with a multiethnic sample of adolescents. The results indicate that females consistently reported higher levels of perceived social support across the Total Scale, and Classmate and Close Friend subscales. Conversely, the male subjects consistently reported higher average levels of perceived support on the Parent and Teacher subscales. However, the only statistically significant result was that females perceived higher levels of social support from their Close Friends. With regard to the factor structure of the SSSS (Nolten, 1994), the exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor solution (parent, teacher, close friend, classmate). However, the confirmatory factor analysis was unable to confirm such a model. Additionally, the role of ethnicity in social support was inconclusive. That is, statistically, ethnic differences were observed between the five ethnic groups (Caucasian, Latino, African-American, Mixed Ethnicity, and Asian) on the Parent and Teacher subscales. However, due to the fact that the ethnic groups were of unequal size, post hoc analyses, to determine which specific groups differed on these subscales, could not be utilized. Further, Classmate support ratings consistently accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in self-image, social, academic, and total self-concept ratings. Finally, additional analyses indicated that there was not a statistically significant difference between the respondents' age/grade and how they perceived social support from the various sources. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed in the final chapter of this dissertation, and recommendations for social support researchers are provided.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Argues that facial expression is an important source of information about infant and caregiver behavior, but human observer-based methods of measuring facial expression are semiquantitative, labor intensive, and difficult to standardize across laboratories and over time. When subject recruitment and observational assessments span several years or multiple sites and population, it is difficult to maintain consistent criteria. It is contended that these are serious limiting factors, especially in large, multisite, longitudinal studies. An automated method of facial expression analysis (Automated Face Analysis) that was developed by the authors is discussed. The authors present evidence indicating that the Automated Face Analysis demonstrated high concurrent validity with manual Facial Action Coding System coding, and in the cross-validation set that included subjects of mixed ethnicity, average recognition accuracy for 3 action units ranged from 85-93% depending on the module. It is suggested that with continued development, Automated Face Analysis will greatly reduce or eliminate the need for manual coding, make feasible the use of larger, more representative data sets, and open new areas of investigation.

Literature has suggested a link between ethnic identity formation and other psychological constructs which may affect school success among some minority groups. This research sought to better understand the values, perceptions, and behaviors related to ethnic identity construction in Hawai'i where every ethnic group is a statistical minority. A mixed-method research design utilized data from 40 student interviews to clarify findings of a survey administered to 580 students from grades 9-12 at two school sites. The survey included the Multigroup Measure of Ethnic Identity. An analysis of variance revealed systematic differences in the salience of ethnic identity across the sample. Rural High scores were significantly higher than the scores of students at Urban High. Scores were higher for females than for males. Within schools, however, scores were higher for single-ethnicity students of a given gender than for mixed ethnicity students of the same gender. Qualitative findings produced examples of cultural resources that students used to explain their ethnic identity, attitudes, and values and provided evidence that females tend to be closer to their ethnic identity than males. The examples also illustrate the role of personal agency in the formation of adolescents' ethnic self-perceptions.

This experiment was designed to evaluate the distributive bargaining, integrative bargaining, and interactive problem solving models of conflict resolution, using intergroup expectancies and attitudes as dependent measures. Jewish and Arab students were paired into mixed-ethnicity dyads to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian dispute about Jerusalem according to one of the three models. It was hypothesized that dyad members using the interactive problem solving model would become the least pessimistic about the conflict, and would show the greatest positive change in their attitudes toward members of the other ethnic group. The results support these predictions, and help to make up for the paucity of research on the assessment of conflict resolution strategies.

This particular Navajo sample evidenced significantly higher levels of ethnic identity in comparison to students of Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, or mixed ethnicity.

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of maternal directiveness on children with developmental delays by comparing maternal scaffolding and directiveness behaviors in relationship to maternal beliefs. Subjects were 25 preschool children with developmental delays and their mothers from a representative urban population of mixed ethnicity and SES. Mother-child dyads were videotaped while engaged in an eight-minute free-play activity and a puzzle task. A questionnaire measuring mothers' beliefs in learning, maturational, and cognitive-developmental theories of development was administered next. Children's developmental ages were later assessed. Tasks were scored using the Mother-Child Rating Scales (MCRS) and the Scales for Assessing Dyadic Scaffolding Behaviors (SADSB). Correlations were run to analyze the relationship between scales. While scores were inconclusive at the subscale level due to high intercorrelations within and among the MCRS and SADSB, important findings resulted including: (a) mothers believed more in a learning theory explanation of development than cognitive-developmental or maturational theories; (b) mothers who believed most in learning theory tended to be more directive in free-play; (c) scaffolding significantly correlated with children's developmental age; (d) directiveness negatively correlated with scaffolding and had little relationship with developmental age; and (e) greater generalizability of the results were obtained than in most previous studies. A framework is suggested for looking at mother-child interaction. Scaffolding provided a better explanation than directiveness for examining mother-child interactions. Suggestions are provided for future research and educational applications of the outcomes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Ethnic identity was conceptualized into three categories: (1) unexamined, (2) searching for identity, and (3) achieved ethnic identity. Analyses of data collected from 12,386 adolescents showed that ethnic identity is an important qualifier of the relationships between independent variables of ethnicity and gender, and dependent variables of global self-esteem, academic self-confidence, and purpose in life. Whites and Native Americans had lower ethnic identity, and Blacks and Hispanics had higher ethnic identity. Asians and respondents of mixed ethnicity had intermediate levels of ethnic identity. The greater the ethnic identity, the higher the self-esteem, purpose in life and self confidence. This mechanism applies to ethnic minorities and to women among whom achieved ethnic identity may blunt the negative effects of social denigration and stereotyping, and it applies to whites, too. The paper argues that multiculturalism in the schools can increase ethnic identity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the relationship of safer sex behavior practices, knowledge of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), social norms, and familiarity with persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with HIV risk appraisal in women. Risk appraisal was measured by perceived susceptibility and seriousness of AIDS. The AIDS Risk Reduction Model was used to construct a salient framework for this descriptive, correlational survey in which 208 urban women (aged 18-42 yrs) of mixed ethnicity residing in areas with high rates of sexually transmitted diseases/AIDS participated. Findings show that behavior, knowledge, and social norms contributed significant amounts of variance to perceived susceptibility but none of the independent variables contributed significant amounts of variance in perceived seriousness. Overall the findings indicate that risk behaviors are commonly reported, AIDS knowledge is incomplete, and denial of risk is pronounced.

The Imaginary Audience Scale, consisting of two subscales, the Transient Self and the Abiding Self, was administered to half of the subjects pre-treatment, and the other half immediately following their Outward Bound course. Results were analyzed for changes in levels of Imaginary Audience preoccupation over the course of treatment, as well as for ethnic differences in responses to treatment, and in responses to both subscales of the Imaginary Audience Scale. Results showed that participants completing the program, regardless of ethnicity, expressed significantly greater willingness to reveal themselves and take risks in the presence of adults in positions of authority. African American delinquents were less willing to reveal themselves to a mixed-ethnicity audience of peers than Caucasian delinquents, and regardless of ethnicity, the reluctance of all participants to engage in potentially embarrassing behavior in the presence of peers did not improve over the course of treatment. There was no significant interaction found between treatment and ethnicity. Potential implications and reasons for ethnic differences were discussed. The results were interpreted as supporting the use of Outward Bound and similar programs in juvenile corrections as a means to improve adolescent delinquents' willingness to interact with, and accept help from adults in positions of power and authority.
