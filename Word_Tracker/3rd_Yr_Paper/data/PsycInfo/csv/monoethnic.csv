The population of individuals with parents from different ethnic or racial backgrounds has grown considerably in the U.S. during recent decades, reaching over 9 million in 2010, and is projected to continue growing exponentially. I argue that individuals from multiple ethnic/racial heritages encounter unique experiences in our wider monoethnic cultural environment that differ from those experienced by monoethnic/racial individuals. In consideration of these distinct encounters, I used reports of critical incidents experienced by multiethnic/racial individuals to qualitatively analyze recalled interactions that were perceived by participants to have led to marked understandings of self in terms of their ethnicity/race. Data consisted of 43 in-depth interviews with individuals descending from two or more ethnic/racial backgrounds, of which at least one had to be non-European. Using the Communication Theory of Identity, 11 manifestations of multiethnic/racial identities were explored across four conceptual frames. Moreover, three specific identity gaps were identified (personal-enacted, personal-enacted-relational, and personal-enacted-communal) and four discursive strategies (acquiescence, circumvention, passing, and dismissal) used to negotiate identity gaps were explored. Finally, participant reports indicated five supra-types of critical incidents that informed processes of meaning-making across five discernible stages of development. As a result of this research, I offer the first conceptual model of multiethnic/racial development that places communication as a central component. Findings from the present study provide insight into the ways in which multiethnic/racial identities emerge, shift, and are revised through communication with others. Specifically, findings draw attention to how discourse functions to define and construct multiethnic/racial identities, and how multiethnic/racial individuals negotiate meanings of selves from salient social interactions.

Studies on Multiethnic individuals focus on one ethnic identity and seldom explore all of their ethnicities. The first study proposes an alternative administration of the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) that encourages responses to each of the Multiethnic individual's ethnicities. The MEIM was administered to 177 Multiethnic respondents for each ethnic identity and 86 monoethnic individuals. Also, measures of self-esteem and psychopathology were measured to compare the two groups. Results show significant mean differences between MEIM1&2: t=6.03, ES=0.53, a medium effect size, and also between MEIM1&3: t=2.94, ES=0.66, a medium effect size. In addition, the second ethnic identity predicted self-esteem and depression, contributing to 39% and 28% of the variance respectively. The second study is experimental and explored the impact of questions regarding ethnic identity including forced choice versus open choice for monoethnic vs. Multiethnic individuals and how ethnic identity primes affected reaction time on an emotional Stroop task while measuring electrodermal activity. The implications of this study are relevant to understand the complexities of the growing Multiethnic population.

Chindon-ya, which dates back to the 1850s, refers to groups of outlandishly costumed street musicians in Japan who are hired to advertise an employer's business. After decades of inactivity, chindon-ya has been undergoing a resurgence since the early 1990s. Despite being labeled as anachronistic and obscure, some chindon-ya troupes today have achieved financial success generating up to one million dollars in annual income, while chindon-ya aesthetics has been taken up by rock, jazz, and experimental musicians and refashioned into hybridized musical practices. In the context of long-term economic downturn, growing socioeconomic gaps, and visually and sonically saturated urban streets, I ask how such an ""outdated"" means of advertisement has not only proven itself to be financially viable, but has also enabled widely varying sentiments, musical styles, translocal relations, forms of business enterprise, and political aspirations to articulate with one another. I analyze ethnographic observations, interviews, audio-visual materials, and archival documents I collected during fieldwork in Japan between 2006 and 2008 in order to investigate how chindon-ya has recently become reinvested and reconfigured with new meanings and possibilities. Bridging cultural geography and anthropology of sound, I pay particular attention to the production of social space through sonic culture. The popular imaginary of chindon-ya is closely associated with neighborhood streets, everyday soundscape, and the notion of taishu-the popular mass, or the public. When the neighborhood streets are increasingly regulated, privatized, and developed, and when ""taishu"" is fragmented through the recession era, what kinds of understanding of space and ""public"" emerge from chindon-ya today as they resonate with the shifting geographies of urban modernity? By extension, through this investigation, I raise what Stuart Hall calls the multicultural question in Japan by asking who constitutes the listening public as imagined by chindon-ya practitioners. I posit that listening to chindon-ya's sounds challenges the commonsense notion of Japanese public space as anonymous, transparent, and homogeneous. Rather, the performative tactics of chindon-ya highlight issues that are otherwise silenced by the official discourse of Japan as a monoethnic nation: the Japanese colonial histories; the presence of ""ethnic minorities""; and political struggles between the island of Okinawa, mainland Japan, and the US military. These analyses in turn shed light on how chindon-ya aesthetic has enabled emergent modalities of political expressions, based on politics of pleasure instead of politics of indignation. Even though my multi-sited research takes place within the national border of Japan, it has a broader regional significance. My research elucidates connections, interactions, and flows between Japan and wider Pacific regions that are produced both within and beyond the national borders. In addition, the combination of my sonic-spatial analytic, based on cultural geography and anthropology of sound, and ethnographic focus on everyday practices has a significant theoretical and methodological import to other entanglements of translocal interactions.

We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 to compare family characteristics of adolescents of a mixed-race or multiethnic background with those of a monoracial or monoethnic background. Mixed-race or multiethnic youth reported feeling less supported by parents and reported less satisfactory parent-adolescent relationships. Mixed-race/multiethnic youth were more like monoracial White youth in terms of being independent but were more like racial or ethnic minorities (African Americans, Hispanics) in regard to family activities. Reasons for these findings are explored. We discuss the need for future research on the experiences of mixed-race/multiethnic youth.

Data analyses show that the conservative government's multicultural policy documents present a binary view on multicultural families: they are either very talented, potential contributors to the Korean economy (possibly educated, rich, and white migrant workers) or illegal, harmful sojourners (mostly less educated, poor, and darker-skinned migrants). Biased toward international marriage families, the government's multicultural policy documents deliver success stories of migrant wives and images of very obedient migrant women who sacrifice their lives for their families. The government's documents on the 2009 national curriculum reform emphasize (a) the superiority of Korean ethnic groups and the cultural kinship among Koreans, and (b) sympathy toward different Others' lives rather than encouraging respect and mutual understanding. In similar ways, the conservative media and the 23 pre-screened Korean language arts textbooks depict Korean society as a beneficiary agency which gives migrants a variety of opportunities. The hardships such as xenophobia, racism, and domestic violence they encounter are described as individually oriented rather than structurally framed. Meanwhile, in the most progressive newspaper and two migrant-led websites, the government's multicultural policies are criticized harshly. Migrant-focused discourses are not often featured in Korean language arts textbooks, but some textbook publishers present and represent the voices of migrants struggling under structural problems and trying to resolve them with their colleagues. Analyses also reveal that North Korean related issues are completely silenced in Korean language arts textbook publications because of ideological and political struggles between both Koreas. In conclusion, this research challenges the monoethnic perspectives presented in the Korean language arts textbooks and explores the possibilities of enacting social changes in solidarity with Koreans and migrant Others.

The first goal of this research was to learn more about parents' beliefs about emotion as an important and understudied component of parents' socialization of emotion, and to do so across multiple cultures within the United States. A second goal of the research was to develop a good model for using focus group methodology in developmental psychology. We achieved these goals by conducting focus groups with parents who had at least one 4- to 12-year-old child and shared their beliefs about emotions in the family. To assess parental beliefs across several cultural groups within the United States, the focus groups were comprised of monoethnic groups and were either: African American (AA), European American (EA), or Lumbee American Indian (LA).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Editorial,"There is still a lot of growing room for Japanese research on bilingualism. Perhaps one of the reasons for the scarcity up to now has been the tendency of the Japanese to think of their own society as a monolingual/monoethnic one, with other groups being 'invisible' (Yamamoto 2003). This view is increasingly being challenged. Scholars have noted that since ancient times there have been multilingual elements in Japanese society (e.g. Loveday 1996; Maher 1994); although numbers may have been small, it has been a society with different language groups (e.g. Kikuchi 1994; Suh 2000; Yim 1993). Although this special issue features 'bilingualism' in the title, we wish 'bi-' to be considered a shorthand expression for 'bi- and multi-.' The research presented here consists of five papers on simultaneous multiple language acquisition from infancy. We are proud to present this special issue. We hope that it will prove to be a thought-provoking contribution to the field, and that it will stimulate much further research, not only in Japanese bilingualism research itself but also in many other typologically disparate combinations of languages.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Slovenia is a small, predominantly monoethnic, mostly Catholic society, with a long and turbulent history of fighting against foreign aggression, which has a long-lasting problem of suicidal behavior. The suicide rate has been very high for the past 40 years (between 25 and 35 per 100,000 per year). This fact was hidden to the international public in the much lower Yugoslav rates until 1991, when Slovenia became an independent state. When suicide is such a frequent phenomenon, every adult inhabitant of Slovenia knows one or more people who died by suicide and has their own experiences of being a survivor of some sort. This has a great influence on the individual and national attitudes toward the phenomenon, but is also reflected in the everyday language, where phrases that include insinuations about a suicidal act are quite common (""My life is so awful I should just do away with myself.""). The always-present problem can produce two antonymic reactions and behaviors at the same time-suicide can be either understood and even expected under certain circumstances, or it can be condemned and persecuted. Slovene literature, reflecting the attitudes of the environment in which it is written, usually explains suicide as a result of failure, insanity, or despair, and therefore is interpreted as highly sinful, and thus a non-Christian death. Suicide-even though mentioned and studied extensively by Slovene scientists and artists-has so far remained predominantly in the domain of psychiatry, clinical psychology, and the medical system, which is more or less true for the care of suicide survivors as well. This chapter offers an overview of coping with suicide in Slovenia.

It is part heuristic, part narrative inquiry, examining the author's own story as a parent of a multiracial and multiethnic child and comparing it with the personal stories of parents of other multiethnic and multiracial children. The participants in this study were all biological or step parents of multiracial and multiethnic children. There were 8 people interviewed, plus 1 heuristic participant; they represented 6 families. Including the heuristic participant, they were the parents of 17 children. In this study, the primary research question was: how do parents experience raising multiracial and multiethnic children? During the review of the literature, research showed that many parents of children of color raise their children using identity competencies and particular parenting skills. In chapter 3, a conceptual framework was proposed in which parents of multiracial and multiethnic children used a combination of identity competencies and parenting skills to help their children interface with the outside world. An interview protocol was developed to test this conceptual framework. Interviews of 8 parents and 1 heuristic inquiry were written as narratives in chapter 4. A thematic presentation examining the common themes among the narratives and heuristic inquiry was offered at the end of chapter 4. Ultimately, the researcher determined that parents of multiracial and multiethnic children do use identity competencies and parenting skills when raising their children. However, the conceptual framework, while useful, also presented limitations. Thus, a revised conceptual framework emerged. In the revised framework, parents of multiracial and multiethnic children prepare their children for interactions with the world by focusing on developing: (a) identity competencies, (b) specific parenting skills, (c) language choices, (d) relationships with grandparents or extended families, and (e) their own and their children's religion. Recommendations for parenting multiracial and multiethnic children as well as parenting monoracial and monoethnic children are offered at the end of chapter 5. In addition, implications for leadership and social justice are developed.

We argue for a view of Kiezdeutsch as a multiethnolect, based on a recognition study that tested the acceptability and evaluation of such features by adolescents from a multiethnic and a monoethnic neighbourhood of Berlin. Our results support a view of Kiezdeutsch as a linguistic system of its own, with features that establish a distinct way of speaking that is associated with multiethnic neighbourhoods, where it cuts across ethnicities, including speakers of non-migrant background.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper falls within the paradigm of postcolonial, interdisciplinary and cross-cultural study. It discusses the assimilative/integrative policies that shape the history curriculum for 1948-Palestinian Arabs as a minority ethnic group in Israel and promotes emancipatory measures for the history curriculum, within the postcolonial multi-ethnic minority/majority context. This paper challenges monoethnic thinking concerning history teaching and marginalized voices. It proposes recommendations for ethnographers, educators and policy makers to produce a history curriculum that acts as a vehicle for peaceful coexistence between the 1948-Palestinian Arabs in Israel and the Jews in Israel.

These associations have been made in a limited number of monoethnic studies, leaving the majority of other ethnicities (e.g., Multiethnic individuals) unexamined. When compared to monoethnicities, Multiethnic individuals utilize mental health services more, suffer greater amounts of serious mental illness, and have higher rates of illicit drug use. To date, there has been no study catering to Multiethnic individuals regarding perceived ethnic discrimination, a potential risk factor contributing to their physical and psychological health, considering it has been associated with monoethnicities (e.g., Asians, Blacks, and Latinos) they may be comprised of. This study analyzed perceived ethnic discrimination in Multi- and monoethnic adults with use of the community version of the Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire (PEDQ-CV) developed by the research team of Elizabeth Brondolo, PhD of St. John's University. Participants were recruited from Northern California universities in addition to the Internet utilizing Qualtrics, an academic survey software website. Results of the examination bequeath important findings to the literature on perceived ethnic discrimination in addition to the literature on ethnicities involved in the investigation (i.e., Asian, Black, Latino, Multiethnic, and White). Multiethnic individuals were found to perceive significantly more ethnic discrimination than Whites, yet significantly less ethnic discrimination than Blacks. Furthermore, Multiethnic individuals with White descent perceived significantly less ethnic discrimination than Multiethnic individuals without White descent. Additionally, Blacks perceived significantly more ethnic discrimination than Latinos and Whites.

The notion of the missionary's incarnational bonding process has been of great concern in my own personal life, as well as in the cross-cultural missionary world. This study uses the Brewsters' concept of bonding as a starting point and develops it further in order to enhance the effectiveness of cross-cultural adjustment and develop a field-based training model. This study consists of three parts. The first part investigates and develops the incarnational bonding theory from Biblical and missiological perspectives. The second part explores the effect of culture-the missionary's own and that of his receptors'-on cross-cultural adjustment. Based upon the discoveries in the second part, the third part develops a model of field-based training that is relevant for missionaries, particularly those from a Korean background of monocultural, monolingual and monoethnic homogeneity. I utilized mixed methodologies in my research design, taking a qualitative and quantitative approach to collect the necessary data in order to investigate three components: the missionary's effective incarnational bonding process and its relationship to cultural adjustment; how the missionary's own culture and that of his receptors affects the process; and, finally, what sort of innovative field-based training model would most effectively enhance the missionary's cross-cultural communication. The research produced three findings: incarnational bonding is a phenomenon that is necessary for and critical to cross-cultural missionary endeavors; the missionary's understanding of his own culture is even more significant and applicable to the incarnational bonding process in the context of a cross-cultural setting; and a field-based missionary training model must be developed further in order to enhance the carrying out of the Great Commission.

The present study addresses this gap by examining the role of alcohol-related problems and anger as correlates of marital satisfaction among newlywed monoethnic Latino couples (n = 13), biethnic Latino couples (n = 28), and European American couples (n = 89). Higher self-reported anger by both spouses predicted lower marital satisfaction for all couples. Ethnicity interacted with husbands' alcohol-related problems in predicting husbands' marital satisfaction in monoethnic Latino couples. Ethnicity interacted with husbands' anger in the prediction of wives' marital satisfaction in biethnic Latino couples. Conclusions and implications for treatment and research are discussed.

Recent studies vary widely, showing that multiethnic people may have psychological functioning that is inferior, equal, or superior to their monoethnic peers. Ethnic identity has emerged as an important correlate to psychological functioning. In this study ethnic identity and psychological functioning were studied in a population of very young adults, aged 18 to 20 with a mean age of 18.92 years. A multiethnic person was defined as someone who self-labeled their parents as having come from at least two different major ethnic groups (based largely on the Census 2000 categories, African-American, Asian and Pacific Islander, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Native American, and white [European-American]). Sixty multiethnic college students from urban areas, mostly from the same New York City area campus, were compared to sixty monoethnic majority (white) students and forty-one monoethnic minority students. They completed five questionnaires; a demographic questionnaire, a national background checklist, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1983), and the Multi-group Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992). General linear model analyses showed that multiethnic subjects did not differ significantly from monoethnic subjects on either self-esteem, psychopathology, or on their acceptance of other groups. Multiple regression analyses showed that while self-esteem in multiethnic subjects was not significantly predicted by demographic factors, psychopathology could be significantly predicted by ethnic identity, socioeconomic status, ethnic group affiliation, and parents' marital status. Psychopathology was best predicted, however, by ethnic identity, acceptance of other groups, socioeconomic status, and self-esteem. A subgroup of multiethnic subjects was identified that reported high levels of psychopathology. They also reported a higher level of stressful family events than was the average for their group. The wide variance in current studies' findings of multiethnic versus monoethnic psychological functioning may be explained by a greater incidence of stressful life events in multiethnic groups. The importance of ethnic identity to the emotional health of multiethnic people is highlighted.

The purpose of this study was to expand the knowledge of Latino marital relationships by examining the role of affect in the concurrent and longitudinal marital satisfaction of monoethnic Latino (n = 13), biethnic Latino (n = 28), and European-American (n = 89) newlywed couples. The vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney & Bradbury, 1995) was used to understand the relationship between ethnicity, affect, and marital satisfaction. Couples' problem-solving interactions were videotaped and rated with the Behavioral Affect Rating System (BARS; Johnson, Johns, Kitehara, Ono, & Bradbury, 1998). The BARS affects used were Affection, Humor, Anxiety, Defensiveness, Aggression, Scorn, Frustration, and Hurt. Marital satisfaction was measured by the Marital Adjustment Test (MAT; Locke & Wallace, 1959). Hypotheses based on cultural classifications and Latino cultural scripts were tested using correlations, analyses of variance, and mixed block entry regressions with interaction terms for ethnicity. There were differences in affect ratings based on ethnicity. Monoethnic Latino couples had higher Affection and Hurt, biethnic Latino couples had higher Defensiveness and Aggression, and European American couples had higher Anxiety. Factor analyses demonstrated that Defensiveness, Aggression, Scorn, and Frustration measured a single construct labeled Anger. Significant predictors of husbands' concurrent marital satisfaction were husbands' education, wives' MAT, husbands and wives' Anger, and an interaction of ethnicity with husbands' Affection. Wives' concurrent marital satisfaction was predicted by husbands' MAT and wives' Anger, as well as interactions with husbands' Affection and Humor. Beyond the MAT control variables, husbands' marital satisfaction a year later was explained by interactions of ethnicity with wives' Anxiety and Humor. Wives' longitudinal marital satisfaction was predicted by wives' place of birth, wives' Anger, and interactions of ethnicity with wives' Anger, Anxiety, and Affection. The findings demonstrate that affect is a key component of marital satisfaction for newlywed couples and that there are differences in the role of affect in couples' marital satisfaction based on their ethnicity. Several implications for culturally appropriate marital theory and intervention are discussed.

Research on ethnic identity reveals that for members of ethnic minority groups, developing a secure ethnic identity has been found to increase their feelings of self-esteem and heighten their self-awareness while lowering their feelings of anxiety and inferiority (Phinney & Alipuria, 1996). The problem is that the literature tends to focus on the experiences of monoethnic individuals while ignoring the experiences of multiethnic individuals. Multiethnic identity theorists assert that the ethnic identity development process is more complicated for people from multiple ethnic backgrounds (Root, 1996). As a result, it may not be appropriate to generalize findings from studies conducted on monoethnic individuals to the experiences of multiethnic individuals. The purpose of this study is to examine the ethnic identity development of multiethnic individuals. Research on multiethnic identity development communicates the importance of examining the various factors in each person's life that contribute to his or her ethnic identity development instead of just focusing on ethnic identity development as a linear process (Root, 1998). In building on past research, I specifically focused on the research question: What, if any, is the impact of family dynamics on multiethnic identity development? To accomplish this goal, I recruited 100 multiethnic individuals who were required to complete four brief questionnaires measuring ethnic identity, ethnic socialization, family dynamics, and self-esteem. The results revealed that there was a significant relationship between family dynamics and ethnic identity for the participants. There was also a significant relationship between ethnic socialization and ethnic identity for the participants who had one parent who was from a dominant ethnic background and one parent who was from a minority ethnic background. In addition, a significant relationship was found between ethnic identity and self-esteem. Finally, there was a significant relationship between both of the family variables-ethnic socialization and family dynamics-and self-esteem for the participants.

Ethnic identity development may be an especially complex challenge facing biethnic and multiethnic individuals, who are often forced to choose one ethnicity. As children of interracial relationships, biracial and multiracial youth have legitimate claims to multiple ethnic heritages, yet these heritages are often not recognized due to skin color, appearance or name. This study examined the differences in ethnic identity development among adolescents, particularly focusing on multiethnic individuals, exploring the relationships among ethnic identity and self-esteem, ethnic identity and psychological adjustment, and ethnic identity and parental attachment. Two hundred and fifty-one participants completed four pencil and paper measures; the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1990), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), the Achenbach Youth Self-Report (1991) and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Greensburg & Arsmden, 1987). A series of one-way analysis of variance revealed that multiethnic participants scored significantly lower on ethnic identity than both African-Americans and Latinos. As predicted, Multiethnics showed no difference in psychological adjustment and self-esteem, as compared to their monoethnic counterparts. In addition, it was found that the relationship to mother and father was significantly correlated to psychological adjustment, but not to self-esteem. It was revealed in a series of multiple regressions that the relationship to mother, father and ethnic identity achievement accounted for 38% of the variance in psychological adjustment. Lastly, a somewhat limited finding is that having an African-American friend conferred the most significant contribution, predicting 8% of the variance in ethnic identity.

Empirical and theoretical literature concerning this population has been limited and often inconclusive. With continued growth of a multiethnic/multiracial movement issues concerning this population are becoming more salient. The current study investigated ethnic identity, self-esteem, and adjustment among Japanese-African Americans and Japanese-European Americans. The sample consisted of 86 biethnic adults (54 Japanese-European Americans, 32 Japanese-African Americans). Subjects were recruited at local college campuses, through multiethnic organizations, and through snowballing techniques. Subjects completed materials that were mailed to them. The study was correlation with a pre-experimental, cross-sectional design. Heritage Combination (majority/minority, minority/minority) was the primary predictor variable with Gender, Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity comprising additional predictor variables. Instrumentation included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) (Rosenberg, 1965), the Adjective Check List (ACL) (Gough & Heilbrun, 1965), and the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) (Phinney, 1992). Results of the study provided a greater understanding of the heterogeneity within the biethnic community and the need to look further at process as well as outcome. Japanese-African Americans and Japanese-European Americans did not significantly differ in their decisions to identify monoethnically versus biethnically, though monoethnic identifiers were more likely to be male. In terms of ethnic identity as measured by the MEIM, Japanese-African Americans were more likely to assert higher ethnic affirmation and belonging than Japanese-European Americans when education and parental support were sufficient. On remaining aspects of ethnic identity, the predictor variables of Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity accounted for a significant amount of variance in ethnic identity. Relative to self-esteem as measured by the RSE, Heritage Combination was not predictive of self-esteem, though the predictor variables of Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity added significantly to the prediction of self-esteem. In general, irrespective of heritage combination, subjects appeared to have high levels of self-esteem. In terms of adjustment measured by the ACL - PADJ, neither Heritage Combination or any predictor variables contributed significantly to the prediction of adjustment. However, in general, the sample represented a well adjusted group of individuals as evidenced by an ability to effectively manage life's stressors and to maintain a positive outlook.

With the hope of facilitating successful program development and reducing the number of adolescents who experience emotional and behavioral dysfunction, an increasing number of researchers have examined the risk and protective factors related to adolescent development and adjustment. In line with such research, this study examined two factors, perceived parent support and homogeneity of adolescent and perceived parent ethnic identification, and their association with adolescent psychological adjustment. The data used for this study were obtained as part of a longitudinal investigation conducted by the Tri-Ethnic Center. In 1995 and 1996, data were collected from high school students attending school districts in the southwestern U.S., one in an urban city (population = 500,000) and the other in a mid-sized city (population = 100,000). A total of 75 Mexican-American/Spanish students, 114 White-American/Anglo students, and 27 Multiethnic Mexican-American/Spanish and White-American/Anglo students aged 15 to 18 were included in this study. Findings indicated that perceived parent support was associated with the following psychological adjustment measures: Depression, Anger, Blame, Global Self-Esteem, and Social Self-Esteem. Adolescents who reported low perceived parent support indicated more depression than adolescents who reported medium low, medium high, or high perceived parent support. The same pattern was evident for the psychological adjustment scales measuring anger and blame. Other group differences were found in reports of feelings of anger and blame. Adolescents who indicated medium high perceived parent support reported more anger than adolescents who perceived high levels of parent support. Adolescents who reported medium low perceived parent support indicated more blame than adolescents who reported high perceived parent support. With respect to global self-esteem and social self-esteem, adolescents who perceived low parent support indicated lower global self-esteem and lower social self-esteem than adolescents who perceived medium low, medium high, or high parent support. In a secondary analysis, it was found that males reported more anxiety than did females. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

Mean CBCL total problem scores were low for all three groups. No significant differences across ethnic groups were found for the Total Problems scale and the Internalizing and Externalizing scales, nor for the syndrome scales, except for the Withdrawn scale, the Sami/Norwegian sample showing the highest scores. However, signicant ethnicity x gender interactions emerged, indicating that the effect of ethnicity was different for boys versus girls. Sami mothers reported the highest and the Norwegian mothers the lowest scores for girls, whereas the opposite pattern was found for boys. Correlations between mothers' and fathers' reports were generally low. Differences in mean scale scores between 122 pairs of parents were found for boys but not for girls, mothers scoring higher than fathers.

There were two main purposes to the present study. The first was to determine which factors are associated with having a strong Mexican American ethnic identity. Four antecedent factors, perceived physical resemblance to Mexican group members, ethnic composition of neighborhoods while growing up, Mexican cultural exposure and knowledge, and parental attitudes towards Mexican ethnicity, were examined. Strength of individual's Mexican American ethnic identity was assessed as a function of individual's heritage and the four antecedent variables. The second purpose of the study was to gain information about biethnic heritage individuals and to determine how biethnic heritage individuals are similar and/or different from monoethnic heritage individuals. Forty-four monoethnic heritage and thirty-eight biethnic heritage individuals participated in the study. The individuals' ethnic identity was assessed using a modified version of the MEIM (Phinney, 1992). The four predictor factors were assessed using measures created or modified by the researcher. Overall, the results indicated that the two heritage groups differed. The monoethnics had stronger Mexican American ethnic identities, perceived themselves to look more like a typical Mexican group member, had more Mexican cultural knowledge and exposure, and lived in more homogeneous Mexican neighborhoods. Several hypotheses examined the relationship between the predictor factors and strength of ethnic identity, regardless of heritage group. Three of these variables, Mexican cultural knowledge and exposure, perceived neighborhood composition, and parental attitudes, helped predict strength of Mexican American ethnic identity. Perceived physical resemblance to Mexican group members did not show this relationship. The last set of hypotheses looked at the interaction of heritage group with the predictor. These interactions were not supported by the results, except for perceived ethnic composition of neighborhood. These results indicate that these variables are important in helping to predict strength of ethnic identity and seem to support the notion that biethnic and monoethnic heritage individuals differ and could be considered members of distinct groups.

Four hypotheses were examined in this study. Hypothesis one stated that there would be a significant relationship between urbanization and multicultural life styles. More specifically, in component 1a it was expected that as the number of years of urbanization increased, multicultural distance scores away from American Indian culture would increase. In component 1b, it was expected that as urbanization increased, multicultural coexistence scores would increase. Hypothesis two stated that there would be a significant relationship between boarding school exposure and multicultural life styles. Hypothesis three stated that there would be a significant relationship between ethnic heritage (monoethnic vs. multiethnic) and multicultural life styles. In component 3a, it was expected that the monoethnic sub-sample would have significantly lower mean multicultural distance scores than the multiethnic sub-sample. In component 3b, it was expected that the monoethnic sub-sample would have significantly lower mean multicultural coexistence scores than the multiethnic sub-sample. Hypothesis 4a stated that the Anglo-American multicultural direction score would be significantly higher than the ""other"" multicultural direction score for the entire sample. In component 4b, it was expected that the difference between the Anglo-American multicultural direction scores and ""other"" (African American, Asian American, and/or Latino) multicultural direction scores would be significantly greater for those who attended boarding school than those who did not attend boarding school. In component 4c, it was expected that the difference between the Anglo-American multicultural direction scores and ""other"" (African American, Asian American, and/or Latino) multicultural direction scores would be significantly greater for those who are monoethnic than those who are multiethnic. The results indicated that with respect to hypothesis 1a, the longer an American Indian lives in Los Angeles County, the more likely he/she is to move away from American Indian culture. Hypothesis 1b was not supported by the statistical results. With respect to hypotheses 2a and 2b, these hypotheses were not supported by the statistical results. Results indicated that with respect to hypothesis 3a, monoethnics are more likely to maintain their culture of origin while multiethnics are more likely to move way from American Indian culture. Hypothesis 3b was not supported by the statistical results. Results indicate that with respect to hypothesis 4a, the Anglo-American multicultural direction score was significantly higher than the ""other"" multicultural direction score for the entire sample. With respect to hypothesis 4b, this hypothesis was not supported by the statistical results. Results indicate that with respect to hypothesis 4c, this hypothesis was not supported by the statistical results. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

Results from a self-report questionnaire showed that ethnic identity was strongly related to both parentage and type of ethnic community. Monoethnic Ss at the coast (with great integration and assimilation) identified mostly as bicultural or Norwegian, but in the highland (with strong ethnic support), they identified strongly as Samis. Ss with mixed parentage identified strongly as Norwegian at the coast, but mostly as bicultural in the highland. Ethnic behaviour and attitudes were significantly associated with both family and regional context, and ethnic self-identification was related to components such as attitudes toward language and ethnic paraphernalia. The authors discuss the importance of community support in indigenous cultures to encourage adolescent attachment to ethnic groups.
