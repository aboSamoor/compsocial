Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Polyculturalism is the belief that different racial and ethnic groups, both historically and contemporarily, have interacted, exchanged ideas, and influenced each other's cultures. Endorsement of polyculturalism involves viewing cultures as dynamic and constantly changing, as well as deeply connected to each other through different racial and ethnic groups' interactions and shared histories. Our past work in diverse samples in the U.S. has found that endorsement of polyculturalism is associated with less support for social inequality, more positive attitudes toward diversity, and lower racial/ethnic-, gender-, and sexual identity-based prejudice. Given heightened levels of prejudice faced by Muslim Americans in the U.S. currently, we aimed to explore in the current investigation whether polyculturalism can help us understand attitudes toward Muslim Americans. We found with both community adults across the U.S. (via craigslist; Study 1) and undergraduates at a university in the Northeastern U.S. (Study 2) that endorsement of polyculturalism was associated with less negative and more positive intergroup and policy attitudes as well as behavioral intentions toward Muslim Americans. These associations persisted when controlling for potentially confounding sociodemographic variables, such as age, gender, nativity, and race/ethnicity (both studies), as well as other established predictors of intergroup attitudes, including social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism (Study 2). Consistent with past studies, these results suggest endorsement of polyculturalism is associated with more positive attitudes toward Muslim Americans in addition to other intergroup attitudes. Studying polyculturalism may be important for us to understand and improve intergroup attitudes and dynamics in an increasingly globalized, diverse world.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Editorial,"This editorial introduces the current issue of Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology. The first seven papers in this issue of the journal tackle the question of diversity in different ways. In doing so, they help us to critically reflect on different possibilities for managing diversity, including multiculturalism, omniculturalism, polyculturalism, and of course the traditional route of assimilation. The four other major papers included in this issue of the journal report empirical studies that have very interesting implications for peace building. The journal concludes with three book reviews. First is an excellent book review essay by Hayward (2015) takes up the theme of human rights and conflicts, through discussing new books on Northern Ireland and human rights. Followed by two reviews by Tobias (2015) and Marcus (2015) that might particularly be useful for classrooms and workshops, on the topics of radicalization and conflict analysis.

We investigated four acculturation orientations (assimilation, multiculturalism, color-blind, and polyculturalism ideologies) and the motivations to respond without prejudice. We examined what predicted support for Harmony Day as well as explicit discrimination. Multiculturalism, polyculturalism, and internal motivation to respond without prejudice correlated with positive attitudes in both scenarios. External motivation to respond without prejudice was positively correlated with discrimination. Conversely, color-blind ideology had no effect, and assimilation ideology related positively to explicit discrimination and negatively with Harmony Day. Using a multiple regression analysis, there was a difference in emphasis in different contexts. Our findings provide antiprejudice practitioners with material for discussions which can promote positive intergroup relations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We review limitations of the traditional paradigm for cultural research and propose an alternative framework, polyculturalism. Polyculturalism assumes that individuals' relationships to cultures are not categorical but rather are partial and plural; it also assumes that cultural traditions are not independent, sui generis lineages but rather are interacting systems. Individuals take influences from multiple cultures and thereby become conduits through which cultures can affect each other. Past literatures on the influence of multiple cultural identities and cultural knowledge legacies can be better understood within a polyculturalist rubric. Likewise, the concept elucidates how cultures are changed by contact with other cultures, enabling richer psychological theories of intercultural influence. Different scientific paradigms about culture imply different ideologies and policies; polyculturalism's implied policy of interculturalism provides a valuable complement to the traditional policy frames of multiculturalism and colorblindness.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In cultural contexts in which sexist beliefs are considered traditional, shifts toward gender equality represent an example of cultural change. Polyculturalism is defined as the belief that cultures change constantly through different racial and ethnic groups' interactions, influences, and exchanges with each other and, therefore, are dynamic and socially constructed rather than static. Thus, polyculturalism may involve openness to cultural change and, thereby, would be expected to be associated with lower sexist attitudes. Four studies (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) with undergraduate and community samples in the Northeastern United States tested whether endorsement of polyculturalism is inversely associated with sexism, above and beyond potentially confounding belief systems. Across studies, for both women and men, endorsement of polyculturalism was associated with lower sexist attitudes for two classes of sexism measures: (a) attitudes toward the rights and roles of women and (b) ambivalent sexist attitudes toward women. Associations remained significant while controlling for potentially confounding variables (colorblindness, conservatism, egalitarianism, gender and ethnic identity, gender and race essentialism, multiculturalism, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation). Greater openness to criticizing one's culture mediated polyculturalism's association with attitudes toward the rights and roles of women but not with ambivalent sexist attitudes toward women. Studying polyculturalism may provide unique insights into sexism, and more work is needed to understand the mechanisms involved.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"To contribute to the pressing question of what drives individuals' cross-cultural attitudes in our increasingly globalized world, in two studies, we examined the relationship between endorsement of polyculturalism (belief system focusing on historical and current interactions, influences, and connections among different racial/ethnic groups) and cross-cultural attitudes. In Study 1, high school and college students (N = 134) in the Philippines generally endorsed polyculturalism, and greater endorsement of polyculturalism was associated with more positive attitudes toward people from other countries living in the Philippines. In Study 2, college students, who were coming of age in two countries with richly diverse histories (Philippines: N = 168, United States: N = 211), generally endorsed polyculturalism, and in both countries, greater endorsement of polyculturalism was associated with more positive attitudes toward people from other countries and toward befriending people migrating from other countries. Across studies, polyculturalism explained unique variance in attitudes toward people from other countries after controlling for participants' degree of national identification, social dominance orientation, and extent of positive feelings toward oneself. Implications of these findings are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Polyculturalism is an ideology focusing on the many ways that racial and ethnic groups have interacted, exchanged ideas, and influenced each other's cultures throughout history and into the present. In this paper, we first briefly review the introduction of and research on polyculturalism by historians. Then we summarize numerous studies with racially and ethnic diverse college students and adult community members in the United States, which have found that greater endorsement of polyculturalism is significantly associated with more positive racial/ethnic intergroup attitudes (less support for social inequality, greater interest in, appreciation for, and comfort with diversity and differences, greater interest in intergroup contact, and greater support for liberal immigration and affirmative action policies) and lower sexual prejudice (lower affective prejudice toward gay men and lesbians, traditional heterosexism, and denial of discrimination against homosexuals, and more positive attitudes toward gay men and lesbians). We conclude by discussing several future directions of this work.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Research on intergroup ideologies (colorblindness, multiculturalism) has increased our understanding of intergroup attitudes. This article reports empirical tests of the relation between a newly studied ideology, polyculturalism (ideology focusing on interactions and connections among racial/ethnic groups), and intergroup attitudes. Across four studies (with racially/ethnically diverse U.S. undergraduates, and Black and White American adults), greater endorsement of polyculturalism was related to greater equality beliefs; appreciation for and comfort with diversity; willingness for intergroup contact; and endorsement of liberal immigration and affirmative action policies. Polyculturalism explained unique variance after controlling for colorblindness, multiculturalism, assimilation ideology, social dominance orientation, and right-wing authoritarianism.

Research on intergroup ideologies, particularly multiculturalism and colorblindness, has demonstrated their importance in the study of intergroup relations. While research shows that each of these ideologies has positive associations with intergroup attitudes and behaviors, each also has some negative associations, prompting calls for studying other ideologies. This dissertation presents some of the first empirical tests of a newly studied intergroup ideology, polyculturalism, which emphasizes that different racial, ethnic, and cultural groups have interacted and greatly influenced each other and continue to do so. I aimed to build and expand on intergroup ideologies research by (1) directly comparing polyculturalism's associations with intergroup attitudes, intergroup anxiety, and academic self-efficacy in diverse college settings to multiculturalism's and colorblindness' associations with those variables (pilot study, Study 1); (2) further examining polyculturalism's associations with social, academic, and health outcomes, namely intergroup anxiety, sense of belonging at one's university, academic confidence, and motivations for alcohol consumption, which is a health problem prevalent on college campuses (Study 2); and (3) testing a theoretical model of the connections among polyculturalism, social, academic, and health outcomes, by testing possible mediators of polyculturalism's relationships with outcome variables (Studies 1 and 2). Findings for multiculturalism and colorblindness were somewhat mixed, with some positive, some negative, and some nonsignificant associations with outcome variables. However, polyculturalism was consistently associated with less support for social inequality, greater interest in, appreciation for, and comfort with diversity, less intergroup anxiety, greater academic self-efficacy, greater sense of belonging at one's university, and less drinking motivated by intergroup discomfort. Additionally, intergroup anxiety was a significant mediator of the relationships that polyculturalism had with academic self-efficacy and sense of belonging at one's university, and academic self-efficacy was a significant mediator of the relationship between polyculturalism and intergroup anxiety. Taken together, findings highlight that polyculturalism has positive social, academic, and health implications for college students in diverse academic settings, providing some evidence for the proposed theoretical model. It would be fruitful for future work to further investigate polyculturalism.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Abundant research on the relationship between ideologies and sexual prejudice has not focused on intergroup ideologies such as colorblindness, multiculturalism, and polyculturalism. In three studies with racially and ethnically diverse college and community samples, endorsement of polyculturalism-an ideology focusing on the interactions, influences, and connections among racial and ethnic groups-was associated with lower sexual prejudice (as measured by affective prejudice toward gay men and lesbians, traditional heterosexism, denial of discrimination against homosexuals, and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians). Polyculturalism's relationship with lower sexual prejudice was mediated by greater openness to criticizing elements of one's culture that marginalize some groups. Polyculturalism accounted for unique variance in sexual prejudice even when controlling for colorblindness, multiculturalism, social dominance orientation, ethnic identity, conservatism, as well as race and gender. Colorblindness and multiculturalism were not consistently related to lower sexual prejudice. Future work on intergroup ideologies and sexual prejudice is discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Scholars have long explored the colorblind and multicultural ideological approaches to improving intergroup attitudes and relations. Polyculturalism, a newly studied ideological approach, focuses on the past and current interactions and connections among different racial and ethnic groups. Drawing on cross-disciplinary work, we critically examine the various forms that each of these ideological approaches has taken across studies, and their implications for intergroup attitudes and relations among racially and ethnically diverse children, adolescents, and adults. Although each ideological approach has been examined in several ways (often combining different forms of each approach), there is sufficient comparative work to draw some conclusions. We propose that a combined ideological approach be implemented in educational settings that maximizes the strengths and positive intergroup consequences of colorblindness, multiculturalism, and polyculturalism, while minimizes the weaknesses and negative intergroup consequences of each approach.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The post-apartheid Dance Studies curriculum in South Africa is attempting to offer school learners both an education and training in dance as an art form. The outcomes-based syllabi are intended to ensure that learners come to respect the diversity of South African society, and therefore a range of dance styles and genres are offered in order to enhance understanding and appreciation of this diversity. Serious questions and problems arise, however, when the intentions need to be translated and implemented into the classroom. Both political and cultural issues inform the hidden curriculum of the syllabi. In addition, the context of schooling in much of the Western Cape, in particular, means that many of the learners in schools offering Dance Studies are drawn from communities beset by current social and political strife. This paper attempts to raise some of the issues involved when we ask: Whose dance are we teaching in the classroom? To what end?

Two small groups of five participants were asked to coconstruct, independent from each other, a visual map depicting a mutually agreed-upon story of a common experience, and then present their map to the other group. Group collaboration and post-process discussion were recorded and transcribed, formal and informal assessments were used to address some variables, and process and analysis models, tools, and concepts were applied. Located in the nexus of visual communication and intercultural communication, the study approached the research objectively and subjectively and covered three categories of theories of intercultural communication (W. B. Gudykunst, C. M. Lee, T. Nishida, & N. Ogawa, 2005): social construction and constructivist theories, theories about cultural differences, and theories concerning communication patterns, in particular communication networks. The data demonstrated that groups' communication patterns were projected into the gestalt of the visual maps, and the coconstruction of meaning was not found in the individuals' personal frames, but in the communication pattern between them-not in the elements of the visual map but in the gestalt. The cocreated meaning was confirmed in a self-organized seating constellation that mirrored the hierarchy of the groups to each other and exposed, subconsciously, the roles individuals had played. In an Epilogue to the traditional dissertation chapters, integral theory-in particular D. E. Beck's (n.d.) Spiral Dynamics Integral and K. Wilber's (2005) All Quadrants All Levels-provided the foundation for developing two new models to accommodate the interdependent relationship between the elements of the human core (the Layers of Complexity) and to fully investigate the communication acts through objective and subjective lenses on the individual and collective levels (the Map of Complexity). Data suggested a paradigm shift into polyculturalism with transcultural communication forms, and the potential multipositionality and contextuality of cultural hybrids, leading to the hypothesis that culture has become an available design.
