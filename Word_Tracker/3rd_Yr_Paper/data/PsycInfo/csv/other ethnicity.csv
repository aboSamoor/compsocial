Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Heightened state anxiety can have a deleterious impact on memory for faces. In this paper we investigated whether anxiety: (i) moderates the own-ethnicity bias (OEB) and (ii) impairs face recognition accuracy at the encoding or retrieval phase of an OEB face-recognition task. Using a typical OEB task, anxiety was induced during encoding and retrieval in Experiment 1, but only during retrieval in Experiment 2. An OEB was found in both experiments, but anxiety did not moderate the OEB in either experiment. In Experiment 1, anxious participants were poorer at face recognition for both own- and other-ethnicity faces. In Experiment 2 anxiety did not impair face recognition. Together, these studies suggest that anxiety impaired participants' encoding, but not retrieval, of faces. The implications of these findings are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",,"Previous experiments have demonstrated that exposure to faces can change the perception of normality in new faces, such that faces similar to those at exposure appear more normal. Here we examined how experience influences adaptation effects in African Hadza hunter-gatherers, who have limited experience with White faces. We exposed participants to sets of either Hadza or White European faces that were manipulated to possess either wide-spaced or narrow-spaced eyes. We collected normality judgments both pre-exposure and post-exposure by showing pairs of images, one with wide-spaced and one with narrow-spaced eyes. Examining the difference between the pre-exposure and post-exposure judgments revealed that participants selected an increased number of images that were congruent with the faces to which they had been exposed. The change in normality judgments was strongest for White faces, suggesting that representations of White ethnicity faces are more malleable and less robust to adaptation, potentially because of the decreased experience that individuals had with them. A second experiment using the same test stimuli with a sample of White participants revealed equivalent adaptation effects for both Hadza and White faces. These data highlight the role of experience on the high-level visual adaptation of faces.

Child temperament measures (laboratory observations and maternal reports) and depressive symptoms were collected from 205 seven-year-olds (46% boys), who were followed up 1 (N = 181) and 2 (N = 171) years later. Child participants were Caucasian (87.80%), Asian (1.95%), or other ethnicity (7.80%); 2.45% of the sample was missing ethnicity data. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate within- and between-person variance in intercepts and slopes of child depressive symptoms. A steeper increase in depressive symptoms was found for children lower in laboratory-assessed effortful control (EC). Lower mother-reported surgency and higher mother-reported NE predicted increases in child depressive symptoms in the context of lower mother-reported EC. Our findings implicate EC as having main and moderating effects related to depressive symptoms in middle childhood. We emphasize the importance of developing prevention programs that enhance EC-like abilities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"People are able to recognize faces from their own ethnic group more easily than faces from other ethnicities. Ethnicity information also easily activates perceptual biases; therefore, the goal of the present study was to examine how ethnicity characteristics affect trustworthiness decisions. We compared the trustworthiness judgments of four samples (two Caucasian and two Asian) to facial images varying along both-trustworthiness level (high, medium and low) and ethnicity (African, Caucasian, South Asian and East Asian). Results showed that trust perception generalized across face ethnicity. More importantly, we found differences in the trustworthiness judgments of other-ethnicity faces between the four samples. Only Caucasian participants showed a bias pro own-ethnicity, especially Hungarian participants when judging medium or low trustworthy looking faces. On contrary, the two Asian samples showed no such bias. Further investigation of the positive own-ethnicity bias suggested that for Hungarian participants, when there are no positive facial expression cues to evaluate, negative ethnicity stereotypes can influence social judgments of faces. Furthermore, this positive bias was highlighted as increased vigilance towards differences in facial cues conveying trustworthiness in other ethnicities coupled with a reduced ability to detect such cues in own-ethnicity faces.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The ability to accurately verify facial identity has important forensic implications, but this ability is fallible. Research suggests that anxiety at the time of encoding can impair subsequent recall, but no studies have investigated the effects of anxiety at the time of recall in an experimental paradigm. This study addresses this gap using the carbon dioxide (CO2) model of anxiety induction. Thirty participants completed two inhalations: one of 7.5% CO2-enriched air and one of medical air (i.e., placebo). Prior to each inhalation, participants were presented with 16 facial images (50% own-ethnicity, 50% other-ethnicity). During the inhalation they were required to identify which faces had been seen before from a set of 32 images (16 seen-before and 16 novel images). Identification accuracy was lower during CO2 inhalation compared to air (F[1,29]=5.5, p =.026, eta2p =.16), and false alarm rate was higher for other-ethnicity faces compared to own-ethnicity faces (F[1,29]=11.3, p =.002, eta2p =.28). There was no evidence of gas by ethnicity interactions for accuracy or false alarms (ps>.34). Ratings of decision confidence did not differ by gas condition, suggesting that participants were unaware of differences in performance. These findings suggest that anxiety, at the point of recognition, impairs facial identification accuracy. This has substantial implications for eyewitness memory situations, and suggests that efforts should be made to attenuate the anxiety in these situations in order to improve the validity of identification.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: This study examines neurocognitive functioning in a large, well-characterized sample of homeless adults with mental illness and assesses demographic and clinical factors associated with neurocognitive performance. Method: A total of 1500 homeless adults with mental illness enrolled in the At Home Chez Soi study completed neuropsychological measures assessing speed of information processing, memory, and executive functioning. Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected. Linear regression analyses were conducted to examine factors associated with neurocognitive performance. Results: Approximately half of our sample met criteria for psychosis, major depressive disorder, and alcohol or substance use disorder, and nearly half had experienced severe traumatic brain injury. Overall, 72% of participants demonstrated cognitive impairment, including deficits in processing speed (48%), verbal learning (71%) and recall (67%), and executive functioning (38%). The overall statistical model explained 19.8% of the variance in the neurocognitive summary score, with reduced neurocognitive performance associated with older age, lower education, first language other than English or French, Black or Other ethnicity, and the presence of psychosis. Conclusion: Homeless adults with mental illness experience impairment in multiple neuropsychological domains. Much of the variance in our sample's cognitive performance remains unexplained, highlighting the need for further research in the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in this population.

Disparities in asthma treatment in the emergency department prognosticate asthma outcomes in children and adult asthma patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between socio-economic/demographic factors (i.e., ethnicity, income level, insurance type, and location) of asthma patients and receipt of asthma treatment, evaluation, and management in emergency departments in Maryland. Methods: This study was a non-experimental research design. The representative population consisted of 146 adults and children with asthma in Maryland. One-hundred-forty-six cases with codes for management, evaluation, and treatment of mild, moderate, and severe persistent asthma symptoms were extracted from the 2009 State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD). Frequency distribution of the population by marital status, length of stay, gender, ethnicity, admission source, and admission type was displayed. The significance of ethnicity, income level, location, insurance type and management, evaluation, and treatment of mild, moderate, and severe persistent asthma was tested. Results: The number of African Americans presenting themselves to the emergency department for evaluation and management for mild persistent asthma was significantly higher than expected, X2 (6, n = 107) = 17.213, p = .009. This was inconsistent with the literature which stated that African Americans and Hispanics used the emergency department more than any other ethnicity. No significance was found between location and asthma treatment, management, and evaluation; health insurance status and asthma treatment, management, and evaluation; income and asthma treatment, management, and evaluation. Gender was independent from age at admission, length of stay, number of procedures, and total charges. Conclusion: Inconsistent with the literature review the results of this study did not show significance the study variables except for relationship for ethnicity and asthma treatment, evaluation, and management.

A total of 302 early childhood and elementary pre-service teachers participated in this study. The Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI), the Creative Personality Scale (CPS), the Creative Behavior Inventory (CBI), and the Creativity-Fostering Teacher Behavior Index (CFTI), were used to measure the pre-service teachers' personality traits (Five-Factor Model; openness to experiences, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability), creative personality trait, creative behavior/activity experiences, and their behaviors to support children's creativity (independence, integration, motivation, judgment, flexibility, evaluation, question, opportunities, and frustration). The mediating role of the creative behavior/activity variable in the relationship between the pre-service teachers' personality traits and their behaviors to support children's creativity were analyzed. There were four major findings: 1) pre-service teachers who had more creativityrelated behavior experiences were likely to use more creativity-fostering teaching styles; 2) pre-service teachers who had higher scores on the openness personality trait were likely to use more creativity-fostering teaching styles 3) pre-service teachers who had more creativity-related behavior experiences were likely to use more creativity-fostering teaching styles; and finally, 4) pre-service teachers' creative behavior/activity experiences fully and partially mediated the relationship between the openness trait and creativity-fostering teacher behaviors. Additional findings indicated that senior and master's degree students had higher scores on creative personality trait and creativity-fostering behavior than junior students. White/Caucasian pre-service teachers had higher scores on the extraversion personality trait than other ethnicity pre-service teachers. Pre-service teachers who prefer to teach younger children had higher scores on creative personality trait than preservice teachers who prefer to teach older children. These findings will enable researchers and practitioners to anticipate teaching behaviors that are likely to lead to positive outcomes with regard to young children's creative behavior.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, LGBT Youth in America'sSchools by J. Cianciotto and S. Cahill (2012). A principal strength of the book lies in its critical analysis of those studies that explore the social and psychological experiences of LGBT students, school-age children of same-sex couples, and LGBT youth of African-American, Asian-American, or other ethnicity. Of course, readers in other fields should also find the book helpful, first and foremost those on the frontlines school administrators, teachers, guidance counselors, and consultants. In addition, mental health professionals, along with the parents of LGBT students and, in some instances, the students themselves, may also derive value from the book. Comprehensive, well-structured, and accessible, this book is written in a lucid style that is refreshingly free of jargon and in-apt moral pronouncements. An essential work, it is a welcome addition to the growing body of works pertaining to our educational system and the experiences and needs of our nation's LGBT youth.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Empirical research on mental health care use and its determinants in young school-aged children is still scarce. In this study, we investigated the role of ethnicity, socioeconomic position (SEP) and perceived severity by both parents and teachers on mental health care use in 5- to 8-year-old children with emotional and/or behavioural problems. Methods: Data from 1,269 children with a high score (> P90) on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in the school year 2008-2009 were linked to psychiatric case register data over the years 2010-2011. Cox proportional hazards models were used to predict mental health care use from ethnicity, SEP and perceived severity of the child's problems. Results: During the follow-up period, 117 children with high SDQ scores (9.2 %) had used mental health care for the first time. Ethnic minority children were less likely to receive care than Dutch children (HR Moroccan/Turkish: 0.26; 95 % CI 0.13-0.54, HR other ethnicity: 0.26; 95 % CI 0.12-0.58). No socioeconomic differences were found. After correction for previous care use, ethnicity and parental perceived severity, impact score as reported by teachers was significantly associated with mental health care use (HR 1.58; 95 % CI 1.01-2.46). Conclusions: Ethnicity is an important predictor of mental health care use in young children. Already in the youngest school-aged children, ethnic differences in the use of mental health care are present.A distinct predictor of care use in this age group is severity of emotional and behavioural problems as perceived by teachers. Therefore, teachers may be especially helpful in the process of identifying young children who need specialist mental health care.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54% males; 73% non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22% Hispanic; 5% other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems increase risk for trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms increase risk for later alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis). Logistic and negative binomial regressions were performed in a path analysis framework. Results provided the strongest support for the self-medication hypothesis, such that PTSD symptoms predicted higher levels of later alcohol and drug problems, over and above the influences of pretrauma family risk factors, pretrauma substance use problems, trauma exposure, and demographic variables. Results partially supported the high-risk hypothesis, such that adolescent substance use problems increased risk for assaultive violence exposure but did not influence overall risk for trauma exposure. There was no support for the susceptibility hypothesis. Finally, there was little support for the shared vulnerability hypothesis. Neither trauma exposure nor preexisting family adversity accounted for the link between PTSD symptoms and later substance use problems. Rather, PTSD symptoms mediated the effect of pretrauma family adversity on later alcohol and drug problems, thereby supporting the self-medication hypothesis. These findings make important contributions to better understanding the directions of influence among traumatic stress, PTSD symptoms, and substance use problems.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Initial studies with healthy subjects and individuals with high risk for psychosis have suggested that virtual reality (VR) environments may be used to investigate social and psychological mechanisms of psychosis. One small study reported that VR can safely be used in individuals with current persecutory delusions. The present pilot study investigated the feasibility and potential negative side effects of exposure to different virtual social risk environments in patients with first episode psychosis and in healthy controls. Seventeen patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) and 24 healthy control subjects (HC) participated in four virtual experiments during which they walked for 3.5-4 minutes in a virtual cafe, looking for avatars with digits on their clothing. The level of paranoid thoughts, as well as psychological, physiological, and behavioral correlates of paranoid thoughts, were measured in different virtual social risk environments, manipulating two factors: population density and ethnicity of avatars. FEP and HC frequently had paranoid thoughts about avatars. Paranoia in the real world correlated strongly with paranoid thoughts about avatars in virtual environments (Spearman's rho = 0.67 and 0.54 in FEP and HC respectively, p < 0.01). FEP kept a smaller distance to avatars than HC. In FEP, but not in HC, galvanic skin response was significantly stronger in virtual environments with avatars of other ethnicity than in the own ethnicity condition. These results suggest that VR is an acceptable and sufficiently realistic method to use in patients with first episode psychosis. VR research may help to increase our understanding of the social and psychological mechanisms of psychosis and to develop new treatment applications.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: To examine DSM-IV lifetime/current psychiatric disorder co-morbidity and correlates in ethnically-diverse obese patients with binge eating disorder (BED) seeking treatment for obesity and binge eating in primary care. Method: A consecutive series of 142 participants (43% Caucasian, 37% African-American, 13% Hispanic-American, and 7% ""other"" ethnicity) were evaluated with semi-structured interviews. Results: 67% of BED patients had at least one additional lifetime psychiatric disorder, with mood (49%), anxiety (41%), and substance-use (22%) disorders most common. In terms of current co-morbidity, 37% had at least one other psychiatric disorder, with anxiety (27%) and mood (17%) most common. Few gender differences were observed but psychiatric co-morbidity rates differed across ethnic/racial groups with larger differences for current diagnoses. African-American and Hispanic groups were more than twice as likely as the Caucasian group to have additional current psychiatric disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. Psychiatric co-morbidity was associated with greater eating-disorder psychopathology and poorer functioning, but not with binge-eating or BMI. Conclusion: Our study presents new findings suggesting that among obese BED patients in primary care, ethnic/racial minority groups are more likely than Caucasian groups to present with psychiatric co-morbidity. Within BED, psychiatric co-morbidity shows few gender differences but is associated with greater eating-disorder psychopathology and poorer functioning.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a growing public health concern, especially among adolescents. In the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, NSSI is classified as a criterion of borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, a distinct NSSI disorder will now be included in DSM-5 as a ""condition requiring further study."" It is important to note that, at this time, there is little direct evidence supporting the DSM-5 proposal over the DSM-IV classification. To address this need, the current study examined the extent to which NSSI occurs independently of BPD and has clinical significance beyond a diagnosis of BPD in adolescent psychiatric patients. NSSI disorder was assessed based on the proposed DSM-5 criteria in 198 adolescents ages 12 to 18 (74% female; 64% Caucasian, 14% Hispanic, 10% African American, and 12% mixed/other ethnicity) from a psychiatric hospital. Major Axis I disorders, Axis II BPD, and suicide ideation and attempts were assessed with structured clinical interviews; emotion dysregulation and loneliness were measured with validated self-report questionnaires. First, results indicated that NSSI disorder occurred independently of BPD. Specifically, although there was overlap between the occurrence of BPD and NSSI disorder, this overlap was no greater than that between BPD and other Axis I disorders (e.g., anxiety and mood disorders). Second, NSSI disorder demonstrated unique associations with clinical impairment-indexed by suicide ideation and attempts, emotion dysregulation, and loneliness-over and above a BPD diagnosis. Taken together, findings support the classification of NSSI as a distinct and clinically significant diagnostic entity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Individuals tend to recognize persons of their own ethnicity better than those of another, a phenomenon known as own-ethnicity bias. One explanation of this bias is the contact hypothesis, that is, face recognition is better for ethnic faces that are seen more often. Own ethnicity bias in children, specifically Hispanic children, has received little attention and this study examined own-ethnicity bias in Black (n = 53), East/Southeast Asian (n = 54), Hispanic (n = 96), and White (n = 247) children 5-7, 9-11, 13-16 years of age from southern California. With the majority of individuals in southern California being Hispanic or White, the contact hypothesis predicts that children should recognize own-ethnicity faces better than other-ethnicity faces and other-ethnicity Hispanic and White faces better than Asian or Black faces. Children were shown 32 adult and child, men and women Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White faces. They were then asked to recognize previously seen faces from a set of old and new faces. Own-ethnicity bias was found for Hispanic and White participants. Some support was found for the contact hypothesis, that is, Hispanic and White children recognized Hispanic and White faces better than Black faces, and for White children, better than Asian faces. Contrary to expectations, Hispanic children recognized Asian faces better than Black faces; and, Asian and Black children exhibited no significant bias. An alternative explanation of face recognition biases focused on children's attitudes toward ethnic groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The current study investigated: (a) the relationships of exposure to the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) with reductions in substance use, illegal activity, and juvenile justice system involvement in adolescents diagnosed with a substance use disorder, and (b) the pathways by which reductions in the target behaviors were achieved. This study is a secondary data analysis of longitudinal data from a large-scale implementation effort for A-CRA. The sample consisted of 1,467 adolescents who presented to substance use treatment and reported past-year engagement in illegal activity. Participants had an average age of 15.8 years (SD = 1.3) and were 25% female, 14% African American, 29% Hispanic, 35% Caucasian, 16% mixed ethnicity, and 6% other ethnicity. Path analyses provided support that participation in A-CRA had a significant, direct association with reduced substance use; a significant, indirect association with reduced illegal activity through reductions in substance use; and a significant indirect association with reduced juvenile justice system involvement through reductions in both substance use and illegal activity. In addition, post hoc analyses using a bootstrapping strategy provided evidence that reductions in substance use partially mediated the relationship between A-CRA and illegal activity.

The present research tested empathy biases related to ethnicity when targets were depicted in negative and positive contexts. Caucasian (n = 99) and Asian (n = 99) participants gave subjective ratings for images depicting same or other ethnicity individuals in socially-relevant negative and positive contexts. Participants rated significantly higher on all three dimensions of empathy (affect, perspective taking, and understanding) for same ethnicity targets than for other ethnicity targets. However, this bias was found only for targets depicted in negative contexts. Moreover, no ethnicity bias was found for ratings of valence, arousal, distress, and interest. The results suggest that ethnicity-related biases in empathy are present, are limited to negative contexts, and are not merely a manifestation of a more general cognitive or affective bias.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: We tested a dual-process model based on behavioral and emotional regulation constructs, which posits that good self-control and poor regulation make independent contributions and have different types of pathways to outcomes. The utility of the model for predicting substance use was tested in two diverse populations of younger adolescents. Method: A survey was administered in classrooms to middle-school students in Westchester County, New York (N = 601) and Honolulu, Hawaii (N = 881). The New York sample was 8% African American, 5% Asian American, 47% Caucasian, 31% Hispanic, and 9% other ethnicity. The Hawaii sample was 21% Asian American, 8% Caucasian, 26% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 34% Filipino, and 10% other ethnicity. Structural equation modeling analyses tested pathways from the four regulation variables through six hypothesized mediators to a criterion construct of substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana). Results: Results were replicated across samples and were consistent with prediction. Unique contributions were found for good self-control and poor regulation, including both behavioral and emotional aspects. Good self-control had an inverse effect on substance use primarily through relations to higher levels of protective factors (e.g., academic competence). Poor regulation independently had a risk-promoting effect on substance use through relations to higher levels of risk factors (e.g., negative life events). Conclusions: Two field studies showed the dual-process model is robust across different populations. Substance prevention programs should consider approaches for enhancing good self-control as well as procedures for reducing poor regulation and minimizing its impact. Extensions to health behaviors including dietary intake and physical activity are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Previous research has revealed a strong relationship between mere visual facial cues and body weight. They can be exploited to validly judge the weight of the human body. We tested to what extent observers are able to judge body weight and height on the basis of same-ethnicity and different-ethnicity faces. Caucasian and Asian observers saw Caucasian and Asian faces and estimated the person's weight and height-merely on the basis of greyscale photographs of the face. These height and weight estimates were influenced by ethnocentric specifics of familiar face proportion and face-body relationship. Own-ethnicity weight estimations showed higher accuracy than foreign-ethnicity estimations. Observers ignored the changed base-rate for weight of other-culture faces in a culture-egocentric fashion. Height judgments, in contrast, reflect a higher degree of sophistication. A bias toward the own, familiar body proportion was visible here, especially for Japanese observers-however, the height judgments showed that observers were able to incorporate the other-ethnicity height proportion to some extent.

Specifically, this study examined whether pre-trauma substance use problems increase risk for trauma exposure (the high-risk hypothesis) or PTSD symptoms (the susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms increase risk for later alcohol/drug problems (the self-medication hypothesis), and whether the association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is due to shared risk factors (the shared vulnerability hypothesis). This study also examined the roles of gender and ethnicity in these pathways. A series of logistic and negative binomial regressions were performed in a path analysis framework. A composite pre-trauma family adversity variable was formed from measures of family conflict, family life stress, parental alcoholism, and other parent psychopathology. Results provided the strongest support for the self-medication hypothesis, such that PTSD symptoms predicted higher levels of later alcohol and drug problems among non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasian participants, over and above the influences of pre-trauma family adversity, pre-trauma substance use problems, trauma exposure, and demographic variables. Results partially supported the high-risk hypothesis, such that adolescent substance use problems had a marginally significant unique effect on risk for assaultive violence exposure but not on overall risk for trauma exposure. There was no support for the susceptibility hypothesis, as pre-trauma adolescent substance use problems did not significantly influence risk for PTSD diagnosis/symptoms over and above the influence of pre-trauma family adversity. Finally, there was little support for the shared vulnerability hypothesis. Neither trauma exposure nor preexisting family adversity accounted for the link between PTSD symptoms and later substance use problems. These results add to a growing body of literature in support of the self-medication hypothesis. Findings extend previous research by showing that PTSD symptoms may influence the development of alcohol and drug problems over and above the influence of trauma exposure itself, preexisting family risk factors, and baseline levels of substance use.

Data were collected from 122 preschool children (57 boys, 65 girls; 86 European American, 9 African American, 17 Hispanic, and 10 other ethnicity) over a 2-year period. Children participated in emotion knowledge interviews, mothers rated children's emotion regulation skill, and observations were conducted of children's emotional expressiveness with peers in both Years 1 and 2. Naturalistic observations of children's peer play behavior were conducted to assess the proportion of time children spend in pretend and physical play in Year 1. Analyses revealed that sociodramatic play predicted children's emotional expressiveness, emotion knowledge, and emotion regulation 1 year later, after controlling for Year 1 ASC skills. Rough-and-tumble play predicted children's emotional expressiveness and emotion regulation 1 year later, whereas exercise play predicted only emotion regulation. Some associations between sociodramatic play and rough- and-tumble play and children's ASC were moderated by gender.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine the use of prescribed psychoactive medications in a prospective cohort of children shortly after they entered foster homes; and to identify demographics, maltreatment history, psychiatric diagnoses including ADHD comorbidity, and level of aggression that contribute to prescribed use of stimulant and atypical antipsychotic medication over time. Methods: The sample included N = 252 children (nested in 95 sibling groups) followed for three years up to 4 yearly waves. Results: Nearly all (89%) met criteria for at least one of eight psychiatric diagnoses and 31% (75/252) used one or more prescribed psychoactive medications. Over half (55%) were diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); of these 38% used stimulants and 36% used atypical antipsychotics. Of the 75 medicated children, 19% received > 3 different classes of drugs over the course of the study. Stimulants (69%) and atypical antipsychotics (65%) were the most frequently used drugs among medicated children. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) showed that male gender (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.5-9.3), African American vs Latino ethnicity (AOR = 5.4; 95% CI = 2.1-14.2), ADHD regardless of Oppositional Defiant (ODD) or Conduct (CD) comorbidity (AOR = 6.0, 95% CI = 1.3-27.5), ODD or CD (AOR = 11.1, 95% CI = 2.1-58.6), and Separation Anxiety (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.0-4.0) psychiatric disorders were associated with the use of prescribed stimulants; while male gender (AOR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.5-9.3), African American vs Latino (AOR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.2-9.2) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (AOR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.9-13.7), ADHD regardless of ODD or CD comorbidity (AOR = 5.8, 95% CI = 1.2-28.7), ODD or CD (AOR = 13.9, 95% CI = 3.3-58.5), Major Depression/Dysthymia (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.1-6.7) psychiatric disorders, and history of sexual abuse (AOR = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.3-18.4) were associated with the use of prescribed atypical antipsychotics. Conclusion: The aggressive use of atypical antipsychotics, which has unknown metabolic risks, suggests that the efficacy and safety of such treatment strategies for psychiatrically ill children in foster care should be monitored.

While research has been done on the effect of individual variables (e.g., attachment style) on help-seeking, there is no published research that attempts to create a larger, overarching model to predict help-seeking. In this study, multiple factors were examined to predict help-seeking intent and behavior. Psychological distress was expected to be related to increased help-seeking. As well, anxious attachment, perceived need for treatment, resource awareness, belief in treatment efficacy, life events, and intent to seek help if necessary were also expected to increase help-seeking, while avoidant attachment, mental health-related stigma, and social support were expected to decrease help-seeking. These variables were also anticipated to moderate the relationship between distress and help-seeking. Participants in this study were between the ages of 18-25 (M = 20.1, SD = 1.8) and predominantly female (79.1%). This was a racially diverse sample: 44.6% Caucasian, 18.7% African American, 13.6% Asian, 12.8% Middle Eastern, and 10.2% Other ethnicity. Participants completed a baseline assessment as well as a follow-up assessment two months after the baseline. Results showed that many of the measured variables were independently related to help-seeking intent (including anxious attachment, stigma, and others). When all of the variables were examined concurrently, life events, belief in treatment efficacy, and perceived need for treatment were found to be uniquely related to help-seeking intent. The results of this study also suggest that the measured variables do not predict help-seeking behavior in emerging adults, as none of the analyses were significant. While help-seeking intent and behavior were initially found to be correlated, they were not significantly related once the covariates for help-seeking behavior were taken into account. The research and clinical implications of these findings are discussed, particularly the implications for research that assumes help-seeking intent can be used as a direct proxy for help-seeking behavior.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Undue influence of shape or weight on self-evaluation-referred to as overvaluation-is a core feature across eating disorders, but is not a diagnostic requirement for binge-eating disorder (BED). This study examined overvaluation of shape/weight in ethnically diverse obese patients with BED seeking treatment in primary care. Participants were a consecutive series of 142 (105 female and 37 male) participants with BED; 43% were Caucasian, 37% were African-American, 13% were Hispanic-American, and 7% were of ""other"" ethnicity. Participants categorized with overvaluation (N = 97; 68%) versus without clinical overvaluation (N = 45; 32%) did not differ significantly in ethnicity/race, age, gender, body mass index, or binge-eating frequency. The overvaluation group had significantly greater levels of eating disorder psychopathology, poorer psychological functioning (higher depression, lower self-esteem), and greater anxiety disorder co-morbidity than the group who did not overvalue their shape/weight. The greater eating disorder and psychological disturbance levels in the overvaluation group relative to the non-overvaluation group persisted after controlling for psychiatric co-morbidity. Our findings, based on an ethnically diverse series of patients seeking treatment in general primary care settings, are consistent with findings from specialist clinics and suggest that overvaluation does not simply reflect concerns commensurate with being obese or with frequency of binge-eating, but is strongly associated with heightened eating-related psychopathology and psychological distress. Overvaluation of shape/weight warrants consideration as a diagnostic specifier for BED as it provides important information about severity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Associations between peer group self-identification and smoking were examined among 2,698 ethnically diverse middle school students in Los Angeles who self-identified with groups such as Rockers, Skaters, and Gamers. The sample was 47.1% male, 54.7% Latino, 25.4% Asian, 10.8% White, 9.1% Other ethnicity, and 59.3% children of immigrant parents. Multiple group self-identification was common: 84% identified with two or more groups and 65% identified with three or more groups. Logistic regression analyses indicated that as students endorsed more high-risk groups, the greater their risk of tobacco use. A classification tree analysis identified risk groups based on interactions among ethnicity, gender, and group self-identification. Psychographic targeting based on group self-identification could be useful to design more relevant smoking prevention messages for adolescents who identify with high-risk peer groups.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) What is the ethnicity difference of dietary sodium intake in relation to hypertension in Canada? To answer this question, we used the health and nutrition survey component of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS 2.2) in 2004 and the Proportional Hazard Regression (PHREG) models to analyze the percentages and the potential associations between dietary sodium intakes related to occurrence of hypertension in different ethnicity groups in Canada. Our results showed that adult Caucasian Canadians (9.10%) and Black Canadians (9.02%) were more likely to have the high level of sodium (>2,300mg/day) consumptions compared to other ethnicity groups. Moreover, male's consumption of high level of sodium (>2,300mg/day) is more than female's in all ethnicity groups except East-Asian Canadians and Other Canadians. The adjusted hazard ratios in the PHREG multivariate analysis of adult high blood pressure (HBP) related to high (more than 2,300mg/day) sodium intake compared to low (Less than I,500mg/day) controlled for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and total energy intake in different ethnicities. The Hazard Ratio (HR) in the high level (>2,300mg/day) sodium consumption, all ethnicity subjects exceeded those of the Caucasian subjects at a significant level (HR, from 1.19 to 1.41) except other Canadians group. In conclusion, when confounding factors are considered and controlled, males consumed more high level sodium than females in all ethnicities except East-Asian Canadians and Other Canadians. Overweight/obesity and corresponding high sodium intake is strongly associated with an increased risk of hypertension. Native Canadians, East-Asian Canadians, Black Canadians, and South-Asian Canadians exceeded those of the Caucasian subjects at a significantly statistical difference when compared people whh high blood pressure (HBP) by those without FIBP.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Previous evidence synthesis estimates of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in England did not consider excess HCV risk in ethnic minority populations. We incorporate new information on HCV risk among non-injectors by ethnic group, and additional information on injecting prevalence in order to generate new and updated estimates of HCV prevalence risk in England for 2005. Methods: Bayesian evidence synthesis was used to combine multiple sources of data that directly or indirectly provide information on the populations at risk, or prevalence of HCV infection. HCV data were modelled by region, age group and sex as well as ethnicity for never-injectors and by injecting status (ex and current). Results: Overall HCV antibody prevalence in England was estimated at 0.67% [95% credible interval (95% CrI): 0.50-0.94] of those aged 15-59 years, or 203 000 (153 000, 286 000) individuals. HCV prevalence in never-injectors remains low, even after accounting for ethnicity, with a prevalence of 0.05% (95% CrI 0.03-0.10) in those of white/other ethnicity and 0.76% (0.48-1.23) in South Asians. Estimates are similar to 2003, although patterns of injecting drug use are different, with an older population of current injecting drug users and lower estimated numbers of ex-injectors, but higher HCV prevalence. Conclusions: Incorporating updated information, including data on ethnicity and improved data on injectors, gave similar overall estimates of HCV prevalence in England. Further information on HCV in South Asians and natural history of injecting are required to reduce uncertainty of estimates. This method may be applied to other countries and settings.

The study compared coaches' value orientations across urban, suburban and rural geographic locations of the high schools in which the study participants coached, and across their ethnic/racial identities. Of the twenty-five (N=25) participant coaches, nineteen (n = 19) were White/Caucasian, and six (n = 6) were Black/African-American. No other ethnicity/racial group self-identified in the study. The study was conducted during the 2007-2008 academic year. This research is significant because sport is so important in American culture, and high school coaches impact more athletes than coaches at any other level (Anderson, 2005; Coakley, 2009). Coaches' experiences, value orientations and social meanings are important to understand because they affect how head coaches and assistants teach values to their players (Anderson, 2005). There is, also, a dearth of research on values, and coaches' values in sport sociology (Cashion, 1998; Hecter, 1992; Hitlin & Pilivin. 2004; Hutcheon, 1972; Redekop, 1998; Spates, 1983). The qualitative-interview study was purposive in nature, only selecting high school head football coaches in the researched state. Participants consented to be interviewed and tape- recorded. Pseudonyms were self-chosen prior to the interview. The taped interviews were transcribed to aid in analysis. Data were triangulated, comparing qualitative-interview, scholarly literature review, and sport applicable social theories. Findings for coaches' personal values presented the themes of: (1) hard work, (2) honesty and trust, (3) family, and (4) faith and other values. Coaches, also, selected the American cultural value themes of: (1) acknowledgement of diversity and inclusion within American society, (2) personal values as American cultural values, (3) hard work as a personal and cultural values, (4) personal responsibility as a social and cultural responsibility, and (5) acceptance and affirmation of American cultural values such as patriotism, nationalism and punctuality. Football value themes were depicted as (1) hard work, (2) respect for team mates, self, and the game, (3) character development, (4) commitment to a high standard of performance, and (5) physical and mental toughness, courage and handling adversity. Therefore, according to these coaches, hard work is their number one personal and football value, and is noted as an important American cultural value. The values are the foundation for the head coaches' decision making process in relationships with assistant coaches and players. Coaches across all geographic areas (i.e., urban, suburban, rural) expressed a strong similarity in all values. An alarming ethnic/racial values viewpoint was voiced by some coaches who stated that they had ""no basis for comparison"" when questioned about ethnic/racial comparative values differences and/or similarities. These coaches had never played against, nor coached against, any other ethnic/racial peer group than their own and, therefore, held limited diversity experience. Further research is needed.

Once hired, hospitality managers must assure adequate training for all employees; training is an important human resource management function that can increase productivity in any organization. This study aimed to assess current training topics and methods used with employees with disabilities, as well as managers' knowledge and attitudes about people with disabilities, in hotels, restaurants, and school foodservice operations in the United States. Interviews and questionnaires were used for data collection. Questionnaire respondents gave a neutral response (mean rating 3.30 on a scale where 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) to knowledge questions about disability-related topics such as specific types of disabilities, training for specific types of disabilities, Americans with Disability Act (ADA), federal and state benefits of hiring people with disabilities, reasonable accommodations, legal issues, hiring process for disabled people, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) role. Topics with the highest mean ratings were: knowledgeable about ADA (3.68), physical disabilities (3.66), mental disabilities (3.52), and reasonable accommodation (3.46). The training methods most commonly used, as reported by questionnaire respondents, were on-the-job training (96%), demonstrations (78%), and self-guided training (53%). The training tools most commonly used were text and manuals (68%); audio/video tapes, DVDs, and CDs (53%); and computer programs (40%). The most commonly reported training topics for hotel and restaurant employees were cleaning procedures (93%), customer service (93%), equipment usage/cleaning (88%), knowledge of product (87%), and communication skills (85%). The most commonly reported training topics for school foodservice employees were food safety (99%), cleaning procedures (99%), equipment usage/cleaning (97%), handling of food (97%), and food preparation (96%). Attitudinal questions were analyzed for the two groups: commercial (hotels and restaurants) and noncommercial (school foodservices). In general, hotel and restaurant managers and school foodservice authorities had a neutral attitude toward employees with disabilities with means of 3.26 and 3.31, respectively. Factor analysis was conducted and correlations were calculated to ensure there was a significant correlation between the statements within each factor. For both groups, four factors with loadings higher than 0.400 were extracted. Factors were named based on the items included in each one of them. Factor 1 was named ""Teamwork and Costs,"" factor 2 ""Training,"" factor 3 was labeled ""Characteristics,"" and factor 4 ""Skills."" Mean scores were computed for each of the four attitudinal factors. The mean score for Factor 4 (Skills) was the highest of the four factors for both groups. For the hotel and restaurant group, statistically significant differences (p < .001) were found between mean scores for factor 1 (Teamwork and Costs) and ethnicity of participants (Caucasian or other ethnicity); Caucasians had a higher mean (3.23). Mean scores for Factor 4 (Skills) were statistically significant (p < .05) based on age and number of years working for the current organization. Hotel and restaurant managers' ages and number of years working for their current organization had an effect on their attitudes toward employees with disabilities in relation to the importance of providing training on specific skills. For the school group, statistically significant differences (p <. 05) were found between mean scores for Factor 4 (Skills) and ethnicity of participants (Caucasian or other ethnicity); respondents from the non-Caucasian subgroup had the higher mean (4.18).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Comment/Reply,"Comments on an article by George J. Unick et al. (see record 2011-25834-013). Unick et al. provide a timely report on whether ethnicity plays a role in clinical, demographic and service system characteristics in the psychiatric emergency service (PES) and subsequent inpatient admission. Unick et al. noted that, in San Francisco County, African Americans were over-utilizing and Asians were underutilizing the PES than adults in the population at large. The authors found that both Asians and blacks had higher levels of functional impairment on PES admission in comparison to other ethnicity groups. Not only that, Asian patients also had a higher probability of being admitted to the inpatient unit when compared to White patients. Clearly, ethnicity plays a role in PES utilization and inpatient admission. What are the clinical implications of the growing emphasis on cultural emergency psychiatry? The main limitation of this study was its retrospective nature and the fact that it included only patients from a single PES. Second, the findings may not be applicable to other settings. However, this study represents a commendable effort to capture how clinical, demographic and service system characteristics are influencing decision making in the PES. This study also fills an important gap by providing a current snapshot of how cultural barriers may interfere with quality PES care. To thrive in an era of healthcare reform, we must take up the unparalleled opportunities for system reform in all levels of psychiatric service to provide quality of care.

Vol.71(10-B),2011, pp. 6452.",0419-4217,,Dissertation Abstracts International,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"The purpose of the current study was to examine the association between mania and close peer relationship quality in a community sample of adolescents. Two types of close peer relationships, close friendships and romantic relationships, were evaluated. In addition, the current study examined two potential mediators of the association between mania and close relationship quality, social skills and social dominance. Due to the substantial overlap between symptoms of mania and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and the documented peer relationship difficulties experienced by youth with ADHD, symptoms of ADHD were controlled in study analyses. Participants were 571 adolescents (57% female; 19% 10th grade, 30% 11th grade, 51% 12th grade; 66% Hispanic, 17% White, 7% African-American and Caribbean American, 4% Asian, and 6% mixed or other ethnicity) from 2 public high schools in the Southeastern United States. Adolescents completed self-report questionnaires during school. The Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) was used to assess adolescents' risk for mania. Adolescents reported on their social skills (empathy, cooperation, and assertion) using the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS). The Social Dominance Scale (SDS) was used to assess adolescents' tendency to be overly intrusive or dominant in social situations. The Conners-Wells' Adolescent Self-Report Scale (CASS) was used to assess adolescents' self-reported symptoms of ADHD. Parent-report was obtained for 50 adolescents by phone interview. Parent-reported symptoms of mania, social skills, and symptoms of ADHD were assessed. Four hypotheses guided study analyses. First, it was expected that greater levels of mania would be associated with fewer positive qualities and more negative qualities in a close friendship and romantic relationship. Second, it was hypothesized that more symptoms of mania would be associated with poorer social skills and greater levels of social dominance. Third, social skills and social dominance were expected to mediate the association between mania and close relationshp quality. Fourth, it was expected that the hypothesized relationships between mania, social skills, social dominance, and close relationship quality would remain significant after controlling for the association between mania and symptoms of ADHD. Gender was examined as a moderator in the main study analyses. Ethnicity and age were used as control variables. Gender was found to be a moderator, and so all study analyses were examined separately for boys and girls. All adolescents reported having at least one close friend. Fifty-four percent (n = 307) of adolescents reported having a romantic partner. Analyses examining qualities of adolescents' romantic relationships were conducted using only those adolescents who reported having a romantic partner. In terms of the first hypothesis, for boys, higher levels of mania were directly associated with more positive qualities in a close friendship, and were also indirectly associated with more positive qualities in both a close friendship and romantic relationship. For girls, higher levels of mania were indirectly associated with more positive qualities in a close friendship, fewer negative qualities in both a close friendship and romantic relationship, and also more negative qualities in both a close friendship and romantic relationship. In terms of the second hypothesis, higher levels of mania were associated with greater empathy for both boys and girls. Higher levels of mania were also associated with more social dominance for both boys and girls. In terms of the third hypothesis, for boys, empathy mediated the association between mania and more positive qualities in a close friendship and romantic relationship. For girls, empathy mediated the association between mania and more positive qualities in a close friendship.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Internet-based patient portals are intended to improve access and quality, and will play an increasingly important role in health care, especially for diabetes and other chronic diseases. Diabetes patients with limited health literacy have worse health outcomes, and limited health literacy may be a barrier to effectively utilizing internet-based health access services. We investigated use of an internet-based patient portal among a well characterized population of adults with diabetes. We estimated health literacy using three validated self-report items. We explored the independent association between health literacy and use of the internet-based patient portal, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and income. Among 14,102 participants (28% non-Hispanic White, 14% Latino, 21% African- American, 9% Asian, 12% Filipino, and 17% multiracial or other ethnicity), 6099 (62%) reported some limitation in health literacy, and 5671 (40%) respondents completed registration for the patient portal registration. In adjusted analyses, those with limited health literacy had higher odds of never signing on to the patient portal (OR 1.7, 1.4 to 1.9) compared with those who did not report any health literacy limitation. Even among those with internet access, the relationship between health literacy and patient portal use persisted (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8). Diabetes patients reporting limited health literacy were less likely to both access and navigate an internet-based patient portal than those with adequate health literacy. Although the internet has potential to greatly expand the capacity and reach of health care systems, current use patterns suggest that, in the absence of participatory design efforts involving those with limited health literacy, those most at risk for poor diabetes health outcomes will fall further behind if health systems increasingly rely on internet-based services.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in persons with bipolar disorder but little is known about utilization of services for risk reduction. We assessed determinants of access to weight counseling in a sample of patients with bipolar disorder. Methods: Patients enrolled in the Continuous Improvement for Veterans in Care: Mood Disorders (CIVIC-MD), a prospective study conducted from July 2004-July 2006. Patient data were obtained from a baseline questionnaire and chart review. Results: Out of 298 patients, 73% received some weight counseling, with utilization more likely for those with higher BMI (OR = 1.12, p < 0.001) or prescribed a second generation antipsychotic (SGA) (OR = 1.80, p = 0.05). About 41% received 2> dietary consultations with consults more likely for those reporting illicit substance use (OR = 1.9, p < 0.05) or SGA treatment (OR = 2.4, p < 0.05). In approximately 25% of patients, increased BMI (OR = 1.06, p = 0.04) and SGA treatment (OR = 2.13, p = 0.04) were associated with greater likelihood of receiving > 2 exercise consultations. Zero-inflated Poisson regression found SGA treatment was associated with more diet consultations (beta = 35, p < 0.05) while SGA treatment (beta = 29, p < 0.05) and women (beta = 76, p < 0.001) were associated with more exercise consultations. Illicit substance use (beta = -0.36, p < 0.05), binge drinking (beta = 32, p < 0.05) and other ethnicity (beta = -0.57, p < 0.05) were associated with fewer exercise consults. Limitations: Single-site study and limited chart detail. Conclusion: The majority of patients received some weight counseling, with obesity and SGA predicting service use over time. However, low utilization patterns underscore the need for research into determinants of long-term counseling utilization to improve patient health outcomes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Over the past two decades, the overall number of female prisoners in the United States has grown substantially. While the number of women in prison remains lower than the number of men, women are entering prisons at a faster rate than men. From 1995 to 2005, the total number of female prisoners increased 57 percent compared with a 34 percent increase in male prisoners. The authors of this article are evaluating a women-focused treatment program implementing curricula based on relational theory to determine its relative effectiveness compared to a standard prison therapeutic community (TC) treatment program. The participants in the women-focused program at the time the study was conducted were 53 percent Caucasian, 20 percent African American, 18 percent Hispanic, and 9 percent ""other ethnicity"" Of these, 47 percent reported never being married, 36 percent were divorced or separated, 12 percent were married and 5 percent were widowed. The women ranged in age between 18 and 54 years, with a mean age of 36 years. The women-focused program was staffed by 16 full-time staff members. The staff group members ranged in age from 25 to 60 years, with a mean age of 43 years (SD= 11.2). Participants in the client focus group identified several issues that they felt were important to address in order facilitate their recovery. There was a general consensus that the top two issues that they needed and wanted to address while in treatment were their drug use and their familial relationships. why they were using drugs. The women who were mothers were very concerned about the effects of their drug use and lifestyle in general on their children. Despite the richness and utility of the data, generalizability from the focus group discussions may be limited due to the small sample size and the fact that the participants were not randomly selected. Thus, the findings from the focus group discussions represent the perceptions of the staff and clients who participated in the focus groups and may not represent those who did not. The information gathered from these focus groups highlights the need to increase the collaboration between the treatment and custody staff in order to ensure that the goals of the treatment program are not undermined by the conflicting goals of the correctional system.

Psychoeducational presentations are among the most time- and cost-effective methods for improving sleep habits. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a thirty-minute psychoeducational sleep presentation through comparison of self-report assessments of sleep quality, physical health, and mental health at baseline and 9-weeks post intervention. Sleep quality scores for poor sleepers significantly improved between the two time points (F(1,238) = 38.471, p < .001). Students in the sleep intervention group reported an improvement trend in their overall sleep quality greater than those in the active control group (F(1,238) = 2.89, p = .091). Intervention interactions between baseline and post intervention of both gender and ethnic group evidenced differential efficacy for sleep quality improvement in some subgroups. While males in both the sleep and the active control groups showed significant improvement in sleep quality, only females in the sleep intervention also achieved this improvement. Females in the active control condition did not improve from baseline to follow up. Whites and multiracial/other ethnicity students in the sleep group significantly improved their sleep quality over time and only whites improved their sleep quality in the active control group. Blacks and Latinos did not significantly improve in either intervention group. Examination of the impact that change in sleep quality between baseline and post intervention had on health-related quality of life yielded results showing that good sleepers (t(89) = 2.75, p = .007) and poor sleepers (t(58) = 3.25, p = .002) with the largest decrease in sleep quality exhibited significantly lower mental health scores over time. There were no significant changes in either group for physical or mental health quality scores in those who improved sleep quality the most. A brief psychoeducational sleep intervention for college freshmen is a viable to implement in a classroom setting and is shown to improve sleep and to evidence meaningful benefit to physical and mental health.

What little research that had been conducted has largely been made up of anecdotal insight of psychological practitioners who had worked with clients. A need exists to speak with the survivors themselves to chronicle their experiences in as much detail as possible to help researchers and practitioners wrap their mind around the totality of the loss as well as ground future research. The participants in the study consisted of twelve persons who had immediate family members who had been murdered. Participants were interviewed utilizing Lincoln & Guba's Naturalistic Inquiry paradigm. They were initially interviewed and encouraged to discuss their loss in narrative and then were asked a series of specific questions that may or may not have been discussed during the narrative. The collected data was analyzed utilizing the constant comparison methodology. Results indicate that many homicide survivors feel overwhelmed by the changes that occur in the short and long term. None of the participants reported positive experiences interacting with mental health practitioners but virtually everyone endorsed peer-group support. There was also evidence that participants whose loved one was murdered by a person of an ethnicity that differed from their own resulted in racist feelings towards the other ethnicity. Further, there was no evidence that the process of interviewing homicide survivors was in and of itself negatively perceived or harmful; rather some participants reported feeling relieved that they were able to discuss their loss in totality without having to edit themselves. Results suggest that homicide survivors may spend an unusual amount of time reflecting on the person that their loved one may have become had they not been murdered. Suggestions also include how to best notify and support homicide survivors and how practitioners may best relate with their clients.

The influences of and interactions among gender, ethnicity, and income on academic growth were examined. The hypotheses tested included: (1) achievement gaps exist at 3rd grade, (2) gaps grow from 3rd to 8th grades, and (3) gender differences are more apparent in analyses of the tail distributions than in averages of the overall distribution. Performance data were scale scores for language arts, math, and science domains, from a widely-used standardized test. Ethnicity and income were strongly correlated (r(630)= 0.79, p<.01). Performance gaps by ethnicity were found at 3rd grade in language arts (beta 02 = -20.61, p<.05) and science (beta02 = -17.58, p<.05), and differences in linear and quadratic growth by ethnicity and income opened a performance gap in math by 8 th grade (beta22=-2.42, p < .05; beta 32=0.19, p < .05), with African American students averaging lower than Caucasians. Influences of ethnicity and income were large and stable in the tails, with low income and African American children over-represented in the bottom tail and nearly absent from the top tail over time. A significant interaction between gender and ethnicity showed African American boys scoring significantly lower in science than their peers at 3rd grade (beta04=-20.90, p<.05). The HM results predicted a significant acceleration in science growth by boys relative to girls after 6th grade (beta21=-2.89, p<.05; beta 31=0.25, p<.05). Analyses of the tail distributions make clear that average differences obscure important information: sex differences differed by academic domain, by tier of performance, and changed with time. These complex results preclude simple generalizations of ""male advantage"" or ""female advantage"" by academic domain.

Unfortunately, the symptoms of many disorders presented in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) lack sufficient psychometric evaluation. In this study, an item response theory (IRT) analysis was applied to ratings of the 18 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in 268 preschool children. Children (55% boys, 45% girls) in this sample ranged in age from 37 to 74 months; 80.4% were identified as African American, 15.1% as Caucasian, and 4.5% as other ethnicity. Dichotomous and polytomous scoring methods for rating ADHD symptoms were compared and psychometric properties of these symptoms were calculated. Symptom-level analyses revealed that, in general, the current symptoms provided useful information in diagnosing ADHD in preschool children; however, several symptoms provided redundant information and should be examined further.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The present study investigated possible ethnic contributions to overly positive self-perceptions in middle childhood. The goals of this study were threefold. First, the present study sought to replicate the intriguing findings reported by Zakriski and Coie that African American children overestimate their acceptance, and European American children underestimate acceptance by other-ethnicity peers. Second, this study examined possible explanations for ethnic differences in the pattern of perceptual bias. Finally, this study extended prior research by examining ethnic differences in the accuracy of children's perceived peer acceptance. Archival data consisting of 826 children in third (N = 284), fourth (N = 241), and fifth grades (N = 301) were used in the present investigation; 237 of which were African American children, and 589 were European American children. Results of this study replicated the findings of Zakriski and Coie. Moreover, African Americans' overestimation and European Americans' underestimation of acceptance by other-ethnicity peers was found to be attributable to more positive views of self and others among African American children relative to European American children. Finally, children were found to be more accurate about judging their acceptance by peers of the same ethnicity than those of a different ethnicity. Possible explanations of what causes African American children to have more positive views of self and others than European American children are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Logit analysis is used to examine the likelihood of Penang (Malaysia) consumers to purchase organic food products (OFP). Results suggest that OFP purchases by consumers of various ethnicities are affected by similar and dissimilar sociodemographical and attitudinal factors. Specifically, Malay purchase decisions are motivated by females, urbanites, and those with higher income levels. Additionally, attitudinal characteristics for Malays include those with food-safety concerns, sick friends/family, health-supplement expenditures, and those who consider price or availability to be important attributes. Meanwhile, the Chinese market consists of older female consumers with fewer children, who are concerned about food safety and who acquire health supplements regularly. Lastly, consumers of Indian/other ethnicity are solely motivated by being users of health supplements.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: Little is known regarding modifiable factors that may explain sociodemographic disparities in breastfeeding rates among women in the United States. Using a mediation model approach, we examined the relative contributions of breastfeeding and formula feeding psychosocial factors in explaining disparities in breastfeeding intentions. Methods: We interviewed 532 expectant first-time mothers regarding exposure to breastfeeding by others (breastfeeding exposure), comfort with ideas of breastfeeding (breastfeeding comfort) and formula feeding (formula feeding comfort), and breastfeeding self-efficacy. We used logistic regression to evaluate the independent and mediating effects of these variables on strength of intention to fully breastfeed for 6 months (breastfeeding intention). Results: The ethnic distribution of the sample was 41% white, non-Hispanic; 27% Hispanic; 14% African- American; 12% Asian; and 6% mixed or other ethnicity. In the overall sample, formula feeding comfort, breastfeeding comfort, and breastfeeding self-efficacy all independently predicted breastfeeding intention (p < 0.0001), but formula feeding comfort had the largest effect: adjusted odds of stronger breastfeeding intention increased threefold for each 1-level decrease (among four levels) in formula feeding comfort. The unadjusted odds (95% confidence interval) of stronger breastfeeding intention were 0.37 (0.24-0.58) for African-American versus non- African-American women; African-American women had higher formula feeding comfort (2.08 [1.32-3.29]) but similar breastfeeding comfort, breastfeeding self-efficacy, and breastfeeding exposure. Formula feeding comfort mediated 37% of the disparity in breastfeeding intentions between African-American and non-African- American women. Conclusions: Formula feeding comfort strongly predicted and substantially mediated ethnic disparity in breastfeeding intention. These results suggest that research and public health efforts aimed at increasing exclusive breastfeeding rates should include consideration of formula feeding attitudes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: To determine if Gleason score exhibits any significant variation between African-Americans and Caucasian men with prostate cancer. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Inclusion required diagnosis of prostate cancer and reporting it to the TriHealth tumor registry from 1995-2005. We excluded individuals of any other ethnicity than the two of interest (N = 15) and individuals without a reported Gleason score (N = 82). For each patient we collected data on ethnicity, Gleason score, age, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, insurance status, and surgery. Gleason score was divided into low-grade (1-6) and high-grade disease (7-10). Institutional Review Board approval was obtained prior to data collection. Results: A total of 1916 patients, (1476 Caucasians, 440 African-Americans) were eligible for inclusion in the study. There was no significance difference between either ethnicity for age, insurance status, and the percentage of men needing a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). There was no difference between either ethnicity for stages 0, 1, and 4. African-Americans were more likely to have stage 2 disease, while Caucasian men possessed more stage 3 disease (p < 0.05). African-Americans were significantly more likely to not have any prostate surgery (p < 0.05). Caucasian men were more likely to have a prostatectomy. African-American men with prostate cancer were significantly more likely to have a high-grade Gleason score compared to Caucasian men (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.11-1.35). Conclusion: African-American race is a predictor of more advanced Gleason score at the time diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Menthol may make cigarettes more addictive and rates of menthol cigarette smoking are disproportionately higher among Black. However, few studies have examined the association between menthol cigarette smoking and cessation, and the studies to date have produced conflicting findings. The present study examines the effect of menthol cigarette smoking on cessation among a multi-ethnic sample of smokers making a pharmacotherapy-aided quit attempt. We hypothesized that menthol cigarette smoking would be associated with lower smoking abstinence rates and conducted a secondary analysis of data from a multi-site randomized controlled trial of an intervention designed to facilitate repeat tobacco cessation treatment (N = 1,343). The intervention consisted of a patient phone call and a computerized provider prompt. The primary outcome for this analysis was 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence. The average age of the sample was 56 years old. Overall, 25% of the sample smoked menthol cigarettes: 19% of Whites, 62% of Blacks, and 25% of other ethnicity (p < .001). We observed no significant effects for menthol cigarette smoking or ethnicity on smoking abstinence rates. In conclusion, combined with findings from previous research, this study suggests that smoking menthol cigarettes does not decrease smoking cessation among older smokers during a quit attempt aided with pharmacotherapy.

Many variables can influence a client's diagnosis including gender. Much more research is needed in the area of gender differences particularly with adolescents in treatment. The DSM-IV-TR recognizes that there are gender features in disorders and lists them for assistance. This study examined a population of adolescents that reside in a residential treatment center and attempted to discover if there was a gender bias in the admitting diagnosis between males and females. It was predicted that upon admission the male adolescents were diagnosed with more of the behavior disorders, particularly Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder, than their female counterparts. Another purpose of this study was to examine the population in general and describe the adolescents that are commonly admitted for intensive mental health services. The results revealed many descriptive features of this population including the median age at admittance, prevalence by gender, legal involvement and ethnicity. The mean age of admittance was 15 years old and the next most common admittance age was 16. The results also showed that Hispanic males were admitted more than any other ethnicity and that they were diagnosed with Conduct Disorder.

Although Estonia has the highest prevalence of HIV in Europe, there is no active HIV surveillance program. Research has shown that Estonia has a high HIV prevalence among intravenous drug users (IDUs), ranging between 56-90% (Uuskula, Rajaleid et al. 2007). Although HIV testing data by voluntary counseling and testing centers indicate that in 2006, 48% of persons testing HIV positive identify IDU as a risk factor (Estonia 2007), the remaining 52% of cases had no identified transmission route. Additionally, an underdetermined percentage of IDUs may have other contributing factors. This project was conducted to determine the prevalence of HIV in specific risk behavior groups and understand the differences in HIV knowledge by risk behavior and HIV status. Data were collected from a self administered questionnaire with corresponding HIV testing data provided by a partner rapid testing project. Of the total project participants (n=772), 466 reported engaging in one of four investigated high risk behaviors. There were 64 initial HIV positive tests with the highest prevalence (37.10%) in persons reporting needle sharing behavior. The second largest prevalence of HIV positives was among persons engaging in unprotected heterosexual intercourse (5.35%). Through logistic regression, it was found that IDU, male gender, non-Estonian ethnicity and high school or lower education level were statistically significant factors in predicting HIV status. Another logistic model identified male gender, Russian and 'Other' ethnicity and high school or lower education as statistically significant in predicting the level of HIV knowledge. Findings of this project that showed needle-sharing as the risk behavior most highly associated with positive HIV status were similar to previous research in Estonia. However, the findings of this project identified differences between nationality and ethnicity on HIV risk and HIV knowledge. Additionally, this project was able to identify the primary HIV transmission route in a large proportion of those who tested HIV infected.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: To investigate the relation between women's reported use of breast and cervical screening and sociodemographic characteristics. Design: Cross sectional multipurpose survey. Setting: Private households, Great Britain. Population: 3185 women aged 40-74 interviewed in the National Statistics Omnibus Survey 2005-7. Main outcome measures: Ever had a mammogram, ever had a cervical smear, and, for each, timing of most recent screen. Results: 91% (95% confidence interval 90% to 92%) of women aged 40-74 years reported ever having had a cervical smear, and 93% (92% to 94%) of those aged 53-74 years reported ever having had a mammogram; 3% (2% to 4%) of women aged 53-74 years had never had either breast or cervical screening. Women were significantly more likely to have had a mammogram if they lived in households with cars (compared with no car: one car, odds ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.62; two or more cars, odds ratio 2.65, 1.34 to 5.26), and in owner occupied housing (compared with rented housing: own with mortgage, odds ratio 2.12, 1.12 to 4.00; own outright, odds ratio 2.19, 1.39 to 3.43), but no significant differences by ethnicity, education, occupation, or region were found. For cervical screening, ethnicity was the most important predictor; white British women were significantly more likely to have had a cervical smear than were women of other ethnicity (odds ratio 2.20, 1.41 to 3.42). Uptake of cervical screening was greater among more educated women but was not significantly associated with cars, housing tenure, or region. Conclusions: Most (84%) eligible women report having had both breast and cervical screening, but 3% report never having had either. Some inequalities exist in the reported use of screening, which differ by screening type; indicators of wealth were important for breast screening and ethnicity for cervical screening. The routine collection within general practice of additional sociodemographic information would aid monitoring of inequalities in screening coverage and inform policies to correct them.

The 2005 NSDUH primary principle is to measure the occurrences of drug use in the United States; however, the survey also covered questions concerning issues surrounding mental health. The purpose of this study is to provide social workers a better understanding of mental healthcare barriers in the Latino community. The literature findings suggest that Latinos underutilize mental healthcare services more than any other ethnicity. Very few studies have attempted to explore possible justification as to the low rates of mental health care among the Latino community. Furthermore, these studies have not had a wide-ranging list of possible barriers that Latinos encounter regarding mental health care. Using an existing database, key demographics and mental healthcare barriers were compared using chi-square to consider possible associations between them. Some barrier variables (at the microsystem level) that were similar to each other were joined together to make up one barrier variable. Finally, key demographic variables and barrier variables were analyzed to determine which associations had any significance. No statistical significance was found between key demographic variables and microsystem level barrier variables posed by this study. The sample taken was primarily a homogeneous sample with pregnant females being the majority of the respondents, thus, not making a good representative sample of Latinos in the U.S. Finally, further study is needed in this area, along with overall mental health care in the Latino community at all levels of social work practice.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: To psychometrically assess the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF) among a multicultural U.K. sample and to examine the relationship between breastfeeding self-efficacy and maternal demographic variables. Design: A cohort study where breastfeeding women completed questionnaires in-hospital and at 4 weeks postpartum. Sample: 165 breastfeeding women at the maternity ward in Birmingham Women's Hospital inpatient department. Measurements: BSES-SF. Results: The Cronbach's alpha co-efficient was .90 and evidence for predictive validity was demonstrated through exclusively breastfeeding mothers at 4 weeks postpartum having significantly higher in-hospital BSES-SF scores (M = 49.4, SD = 12.9) than mothers who were partially breastfeeding (M = 44.7, SD = 9.5) or bottle-feeding, M = 42.4, SD = 11.7; F(2)51.62, po.001. Caucasian mothers had significantly lower mean scores (M = 44.4, SD = 12.1) than those of other ethnicity, M = 48.4, SD = 12.9, t(163) = -2.06, p = .04. Conclusions: This study builds upon previous research and provides additional evidence suggesting that the BSES-SF has sound psychometric properties and can be utilized among diverse samples, including Southeast Asian mothers.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Over the past two decades, studies have provided evidence for the strong link between substance use (SU) and delinquency among adolescents. However, the dynamics of this relationship and its temporal ordering remain unclear. The current study used four waves of data collected from high-risk youth over a 12-month period to examine the temporal association between SU and delinquency. Youth (n = 449) were recruited from the Los Angeles juvenile probation system. The majority of the sample was male (87%), with 43% Hispanic, 16% White, 15% African American, and 26% of participants describing themselves as some other ethnicity. We estimated a series of cross-lagged path models using maximum likelihood estimation and controlled for gender, age, ethnicity, and time spent in a controlled environment during the study period. We estimated models examining the cross-lagged association between SU and drug-related crime, interpersonal crime, and property crime. The temporal relationship between SU and delinquency was similar across the three types of crime, thus we estimated a fourth model examining the relationship between SU and a latent delinquency variable indicated by the three crime scales. Findings indicated that the relationship between SU and delinquency was reciprocal at each time point, suggesting that the reciprocal effects of SU and delinquency appear to be fairly stable over time.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"HIV treatment and management is constantly evolving. This is as a result of more treatment options coming on stream, tolerance changes and progress in treatment management. HIV infection today, in resource-rich countries and in the presence of combination therapies, is experienced as lifelong treatment punctuated by adjustments to antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. People who are diagnosed as HIV positive face a number of challenges and changes around the decision to commence treatment, responses to treatment and changes in treatment regimens. This study was set up to examine the experience of switching treatments and the impact of such switches on psychological parameters. The method used was a cross-sectional questionnaire study. A group of 779 HIV-positive clinic attendees at four clinics in London and South East England participated in the study (86% response rate). They provided detail of their treatment switching experiences as well as demographic details, risk and optimism evaluations, quality of life, symptom burden, adherence and disclosure information. The sample (n = 779) comprised 183 (24%) females, 76 (10%) heterosexual males and 497 gay males (66%). Self-reported ethnicity was 67% white, 25% black, 3% Asian and 5% mixed/other ethnicity. One hundred and fifty-five (21%) were ART-naive and 624 (79%) were ART experienced; 161 (22%) were receiving their first regimen, 135 (18%) had experienced one regimen switch, 196 (26%) had multiple switches and 99 (13.3%) had stopped treatment. Treatment naive, non-switchers and single switchers generally reported lower symptom burden and higher quality of life. Multiple switchers reported higher physical symptom burden and higher global symptom distress scores. Those who had stopped treatment had significantly lower quality-of-life scores than all other groups. Suicidal ideation was high across the groups and nearly a fifth of all respondents had not disclosed their HIV status to anyone. Reported adherence was suboptimal -79% of subjects were at least 95% adherent on self-report measures of doses taken over the preceding week. In conclusion, nearly half this clinic sample will have switched treatments. A holistic approach is needed to understand the psychological effects of such switches if lifelong treatment is to be maintained and those on antiretroviral treatment are to attain good quality of life and minimize symptom burden.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: This study examined two potential mechanisms linking violence exposure and health risk behavior among adolescents in psychiatric care: sensation seeking and coping with stress through escape behavior. Method: Male (59%) and female adolescents (N=251), ages 12 to 19 years, from diverse ethnic backgrounds (61% African American, 19% white, 12% Latino, 8% biracial or other ethnicity) completed a computer-administered survey assessing study variables from 1999-2004. Overall clinic consent rate was 41%. Age and gender were included in all analyses. Results: Consistent with the literature on nonpsychiatric samples, violence exposure was associated with both increased substance use and sexual risk taking. Violence exposure was not associated with motivation to engage in risk behavior as a means of escape, although motivation to cope through escape was associated with a greater likelihood of substance use. Sensation seeking was related to substance use and sexual risk taking among all adolescents and with violence exposure primarily within male adolescents. Conclusions: Clinical interventions should promote adaptive coping strategies that emphasize maintaining healthy behavior, effective problem solving skills, and stress management techniques.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: A region at chromosome 22q11.21 has been reported to potentially harbor a candidate gene for schizophrenia, ZDHHC8 (zinc finger, DHHC domain containing 8; also annotated as KIAA1292) in a number of studies. This finding has been replicated in Han Chinese, but not in other ethnicity-specific studies. For further support from within the Han Chinese ethnic group, we selected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located at the distal 50-end (rs1633445; intron 10 of HpaII tiny fragments locus 9C, HTF9C) and the intron 4 (rs175174) of ZDHHC8 gene to test if these were associated with schizophrenia in a study sample of Taiwan. Methods: A total of 218 schizophrenia families with at least two affected siblings participated in this study. These two SNPs were genotyped using matrix-assisted laser desorption/localization ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Results: Significant associations with schizophrenia were not shown from these two SNPs. After stratifying schizophrenia according to the deficit and the nondeficit of sustained attention assessed by the Continuous Performance Test, the rs1633445 showed significant association with schizophrenia in the presence of a deficit in sustained attention (P < 0.04). Conclusion: SNP rs1633445 of the HTF9C gene may be associated with a deficit in sustained attention within schizophrenia, in a Taiwanese cohort. The deficit of sustained attention may be an endophenotype of schizophrenia, and warrants further study.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The study of peer group status typically involves examination of peer nominations received. In this study, the focus was on nominations given and received. We examined the degree to which middle school students from different ethnic groups demonstrate same-ethnicity preferences in their peer nominations, the effects of the classroom ethnic composition on these preferences, and the association between same-ethnicity preferences and social standing. Latina/o, Asian, and White students demonstrated a positive same-ethnicity bias (i.e., greater acceptance and less rejection of same ethnicity peers) whereas African-American students demonstrated a global same ethnicity bias (i.e., they were more likely to nominate African-American students in general). All students made more nominations to same-ethnicity peers when there were larger numbers of same-ethnicity peers in the classroom. Students who made more acceptance nominations to same-ethnicity peers were more accepted among same ethnicity peers and less accepted among other-ethnicity peers. The significance of the ethnic context to understanding students' peer status and the benefits and costs of same-ethnicity biases are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: Differential item functioning (DIF) is present when respondents of unique subgroups endorse certain items differently given the respondents have the same underlying ability. This study investigates the presence of DIF regarding chronic illnesses among items of the physical functioning (PF) and mental health (MH) domains of the SF-36 health survey. Methods: Multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model was applied to data extracted from the Kaiser Permanente database for members who completed the SF-36 during 1994-1995 (N = 7538). DIF effects were evaluated for sociodemographic variables and for indicators of 5 chronic conditions: hypertension, rheumatic conditions, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and depression. An iterative strategy with backward selection was applied to build DIF models, which were estimated by weighted least squares. The Hochberg procedure was applied to P values for multiple tests. Results: After controlling for the selected covariates and the latent ability, DIF was present in 3 items for hypertension, one for respiratory diseases, and one for diabetes. Adjusting for DIF did not modify the overall pattern of exogenous variables' effects on PF or MH, except Hispanic and other ethnicity on PF, education on MH became insignificant; and black ethnicity on PF, old ages and other ethnicity on MH became significant. Conclusions: Considering the number of items and disease subgroups compared, the presence of DIF was minimal among items of the PF and MH domains of the SF-36. DIF had little effect on comparisons of sociodemographic or disease groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Non-medical use of sedatives and tranquilizers carries risks including development of abuse/dependence. Such use may correlate with psychiatric symptoms. Methods: Cross-sectional survey, the 2002-2004 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Respondents 18 years and older (n = 92,020). Bivariate and multivariable associations were investigated. Results: The prevalence of past-year non-medical use of sedatives or tranquilizers was 2.3%. Of those with non-medical use, 9.8% met criteria for abuse/dependence. On multivariable analysis, panic symptoms and elevated serious mental illness scores were associated with past-year non-medical use. Also, the following past-year socio-demographic and substance use covariates were associated with past-year non-medical sedative or tranquilizer use: female sex, white/Hispanic/other ethnicity, criminal arrest, uninsurance, unemployment, alcohol abuse or dependence, cigarette use, illicit drug use, younger age of initiating illicit substance use, and any history of IV drug use. Among those with sedative or tranquilizer use, those with abuse/dependence were more likely to have agoraphobic symptoms. In addition, they were more likely to be older, unmarried, have a low education level and have been arrested. Conclusions: Non-medical use of sedatives and tranquilizers is common. Furthermore, nearly 10% of those with non-medical use meet criteria for abuse/dependence. Anxiety symptoms associated with non-medical use (panic symptoms) and abuse/dependence (agoraphobia) should alert clinicians to screen for these problems and consider alternate treatment or referral.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"A novel motivational enhancement based secondary alcohol intervention has been shown to increase quit attempts for youth with heavier alcohol use histories (Brown et al, 2005). In the present study, we examined rates of self-selection into the three formats of this alcohol intervention: group, individual, and website; and examined differences between intervention participants and the general school population and across the three formats. Over four years, students at four schools were surveyed (n = 6,000) and were provided the opportunity to participate in Project Options (PO). Youth who were selected into PO (n = 1,147) were younger and more likely to identify as African American or Multiple/Other ethnicity than the school populations. More teens in PO reported lifetime alcohol use (65% vs. 60%); however, the school population reported more current (past 30 day) drinking. Boys were more likely to utilize the group format and minority youth were more likely to select the individual format. Findings highlight the utility of multiple intervention formats to engage youth in early intervention for alcohol problems.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Recent literature has indicated that a significant percentage of oncology patients describe finding some benefit (e.g., improved personal growth, sense of meaning, and enhanced interpersonal relationships) in the cancer experience. However, few studies have investigated the role of group-based psychosocial interventions in improving benefit finding (BF), and virtually none have investigated these constructs in men. Purpose: This study examined whether a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention improves BF and quality of life (QoL) in men recovering from treatment for localized prostate cancer. Methods: Participants in this study were 191 men (M age = 65.1) treated with radiation or radical prostatectomy for clinically localized (i.e., Stage I or II) prostate cancer. Participants were primarily non-Hispanic White (40%) or Hispanic (41%), followed by Black (18%) and other ethnicity (1%), were an average of 65.1 years old (SD = 7.7), and earned an average of $47,800 annually (SD = $41,000). Participants were randomized to either a 10-week group-based cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention or a half-day educational seminar as a control condition. All participants provided demographic information and completed the Positive Contributions Scale-Cancer to assess BF, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy to measure quality of life, and a measure of perceived stress management skills. Structural equation modeling was utilized for all analyses. Results: Results indicated that the CBSM condition led to increases in BF and QoL and that these changes were mediated by the development of stress management skills. Conclusions: Results support the use of group-based cognitive-behavioral interventions in promoting QoL and BF in this population.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The pleiotropic messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in a variety of higher CNS functions, including learning, memory, and emotionality. In the human brain, NO is predominantly formed by neuronal NO synthase (NOS-I), while the so-called 'endothelial' isoform NOS-III also contributes to NO generation. We recently reported that NOS-III knockout mice display decreased adult neurogenesis and reduced responsiveness in a learned helplessness paradigm. To examine whether NOS-III plays a role in affective disorders as well, we tested a NOS-III gene haplotype, consisting of three functional polymorphisms, for an association with bipolar disorder and major depression. A significant global haplotype association with bipolar disorder (n = 284 controls; n = 91 patients; pglobal = 0.021; pt-a-g < 0.001), but not unipolar depression (n = 45) was detected. Our results thus suggest that the NOS-III genotype may convey a modest genetic risk to develop bipolar disorder. This finding should be further clarified by the use of within-family designs and in samples of other ethnicity.

Compared with two control groups, the participant group showed greater empathy toward members of the ""other"" ethnicity, even one year after participation in the peace workshops. Consistent with the attitudinal data on empathy, participants donated more money to help poor children of the ""other"" ethnicity than did nonparticipants. Implications are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: A comprehensive assessment of the psychosocial risk profiles of adolescents who report forced sexual intercourse remains an important gap in the literature, precluding meaningful discussion of the implications of such experiences. Methods: Ninth through twelfth grade high school adolescents(n = 13,601) who completed the 2001 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey were participants. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine all significant independent relationships. Results: The lifetime prevalence of forced sex for females and males was 10.2% and 5.1%, respectively. For the overall sample, feeling sad/hopeless (odds ratio [OR] 1.9), having considered (OR 2.1) or attempted (OR 1.4) suicide, being a victim of physical dating violence (OR 2.8) heavy cigarette use (OR 1.4), binge drinking (OR 0.7), having multiple recent sexual partners (OR 8.3) and unprotected sex (OR 1.7) were correlated with a history of forced sex. Among females, associations were found among sad/hopeless feelings (OR 1.6), having considered suicide(OR 2.2), fighting (OR 1.3), physical dating violence (OR 2.1) heavy cigarette use (OR 1.8), multiple sexual partners (OR 9.3) , alcohol/or drug use before sex (OR 1.6) and unprotected sex (OR 1.5). Among males, associations were found among sad/hopeless feelings (OR 1.8), attempted suicide (OR 1.9), gun carrying (OR 1.8), physical dating violence (OR 4.3), multiple sexual partners (OR 7.8), unprotected sex (OR 1.9), and other ethnicity (OR 3.3). Conclusions: Although a history of forced sexual intercourse affects a small number of adolescents, it is an important public health issue. The psychological and behavioral correlates of forced sexuality suggest that these youth have been harmed and may further place themselves in harm's way. Furthermore, the profiles of adolescent females and males who report such experiences are distinct in ways that warrant their independent examination and attention.

Telemedicine increases access to psychological interventions by linking the child and the clinician using interactive televideo (ITV). The current study evaluated an 8-week, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for childhood depression either face-to-face or over ITV. The telemedicine setup included two PC-based PictureTel systems at 128 kilibits/second. Children were assessed for childhood depression using the mood section of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present Episode (K-SADS-P). Thirty-eight families enrolled in the study and were randomized to either face-to-face or ITV treatment. Twenty-eight families completed the intervention. At pre- and post-treatment, the parent completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC). The child completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the BASC. The 28 study completers differed significantly from the 10 noncompleters on the following factors: fewer ""other"" ethnicity, more ADHD symptoms, and fewer parent depressive symptoms. The CBT treatment across the two conditions was effective. The significant Time main effects (p < .05) included: CDI total score, Parent BASC Externalizing composite, Parent BASC Internalizing composite, Parent BASC Behavior Symptom Index, Child BASC Critical Items, Child BASC School Problems composite, Child BASC Clinical composite, Child BASC Adjustment composite, Child BASC Emotional Symptom Index, and Child BASC Depression subscale. The significant Group by Time interaction effects (p < .05) were a faster rate of decline in the CDI total score for the ITV group and a faster rate of decline in the Child School Problems composite in the ITV group. The overall remission from depression based on post-evaluation with the KSADS-P was 82% and did not significantly differ across delivery method. In addition, the families in the ITV condition reported high satisfaction with the treatment on the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire and reported little difficulty hearing or seeing the therapist. The results suggest that telemedicine provides an effective alternative delivery system for treating childhood depression. Future studies may address implementing the CBT over ITV in the community and over different technologies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"For decades, suicide rates among minority African American and Latino young people have been stable and, when compared with Whites, relatively low. This is no longer the case, underscoring the need for documenting and understanding the problem of suicidality in this population. We report on the prevalence and predictors of suicidality among 879 urban adolescents in the Reach for Health study. All youth resided in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods; 69% were African American, 16% Latino, and 15% reported mixed or other ethnicity. In the past year, 15% had seriously considered suicide; 13% had made a suicide plan, 11% had attempted suicide at least once, and 4% reported multiple attempts. Risk factors significantly related to suicidal ideation are being female, having basic needs unmet, engaging in same-gender sex, and depression. Resiliency factors include family closeness and, marginally, religiosity. Risk factors related to reports of suicide attempts are being female, being Hispanic, and depression; family closeness is strong resiliency factor. Family composition, ethnic identity, coping style, peer support, and school attachment are not significant correlates of suicidal ideation or attempts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: To develop nationally representative estimates of rates of diagnosis of depression; to determine rates and type of treatment received by those diagnosed with depression; and to ascertain socioeconomic differences and trends in treatment rates of depression, including the effect of supplemental insurance coverage, for elderly Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Design: Analysis of merged interview and Medicare claims data for multiple years from merged Medicare claims and interview data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a nationally representative survey of Medicare participants. Setting: Community dwellers. Participants: Twenty thousand nine hundred sixty-six community-dwelling respondents aged 65 and older in the MCBS cost and use files for 1992 through 1998. Measurements: Diagnoses recorded in Medicare claims were used to identify individuals who received a diagnosis of depression from a healthcare provider; pharmacy and claims data were used to identify receipt of antidepressants and psychotherapy by those diagnosed. Results: The rate of depression diagnosis more than doubled, reaching 5.8% in 1998. Overall, about two-thirds of those diagnosed received treatment in each year; but those aged 75 and older, those of ""Hispanic or other"" ethnicity, and those without additional coverage to supplement Medicare were significantly less likely to receive treatment, controlling for other characteristics. If treated, members of these disadvantaged subgroups were less likely to receive psychotherapy. Conclusion: Although depression has been thought until recent years to be underrecognized in the elderly, rates of diagnosis increased dramatically in the 1990s, with concomitant increases in treatment. Nevertheless, significant disparities by age, ethnicity, and supplemental insurance coverage persist in treatment of those diagnosed. Because depression is a major source of potentially treatable morbidity in older people, increased efforts are needed to ensure access to appropriate treatment across all subgroups of older people and to remove economic barriers to treatment.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study determined whether a diverse group of people would predominantly choose a white male physician regardless of group member's sex and ethnicity when given a choice among 6 actor-portrayed video doctors (males and females of Latino, European, and African descent) and whether further exposure would alter initial selections. Participants selected a video doctor after viewing a brief introduction and again after viewing the delivery of a prevention message. Three hundred ninety-five participants recruited at a shopping mall in the San Francisco Bay Area participated in the study. Initial and final video doctor selections and ratings of video doctors on interpersonal qualities were measured. Most participants initially chose a female video doctor and even more did so at final selection. Approximately half initially chose a same-race video doctor, but fewer did so at final selection. In addition, at final selection 57% of Asian Americans and other-ethnicity participants chose a non-European American video doctor. Many healthcare consumers will accept physicians of both sexes and of different races. After observing the video doctors demonstrate a professional and warm affect, participants became even more receptive to choosing a video doctor of a different race.

Participants were 278 18-35 mo olds who were highly diverse in SES, ethnic composition, and language background. Results show that vocabulary scores increased markedly with age, were somewhat higher in girls, and were modestly correlated with SES. Children of non-Latino White ethnicity had significantly higher vocabulary scores and mean length of phrases than children of African American or other ethnicity (Hispanic, Asian, Native Americans, South Asian, mixed), even when SES was used as a covariate. Rate of language delay, using the cut-off of fewer than 50 words or no word combinations, was lower in the non-Latino White group than in the other 2 ethnic groups. Correlations between Language Development Survey scores and problem scores on the Child Behavior Checklist were low, indicating that language delay and emotional/behavior problems were not closely associated in this population sample.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"HIV prevention efforts among drug users have incorporated social support to reinforce risk reduction. This article examines the extent to which sex partner characteristics, including partner support, influence HIV sex risk practices among a little studied population of non-injecting heroin users, 257 of whom (mean age 32 yrs) were recruited in New York City between 1996 and 2001. The sample was racially/ethnically diverse (26% African American, 43% Latino, 31% white or other ethnicity) and 65% male. Three-quarters reported having unprotected intercourse within 30 days; 27% had sex with partners at known risk of being HIV infected. There were no gender differences in terms of sex or drug use practices; however, gender differences in sex partner characteristics were apparent. Men were significantly less likely than women to have partners who used drugs, receive support from their partners, use heroin with their partners, and have partners at known risk of being HIV infected. For men, increased sex risk was independently associated with sex partner support, and for women, increased sex risk was independently associated with having used heroin with sex partners. Social support may have detrimental, as well as beneficial, consequences on HIV risk.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Evaluated the factors associated with initiation of services in the Boston HAPPENS Program for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and hard to reach youth who are 12-24 yrs old. The program served 2116 (64% female; mean age 19.8 yrs). At first contact with the program, 56% received outreach services; and 91% received a health intervention. Among those receiving a health intervention, 55% had HIV counseling and testing services, 49% medical care, 24% case management, and 9% mental health services. HIV-positive youth needed more contacts before a first medical visit than those who were HIV-negative or untested. Logistic regression modeling showed that for young women, older age, lesbian-bisexual orientation, substance use, high-risk sexual behaviors, and receiving outreach services at first contact were independent predictors of initiation of services at outreach agencies; however, unprotected sex with males, and pregnancy were associated with a greater likelihood of care at hospitals or community health centers. For young men, older age, Asian/other ethnicity, and substance abuse were associated with care at outreach agencies; however, positive HIV status and unprotected sex with females were associated with care at hospitals or community health centers.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examines the temporal association between body image and depressive symptoms in an ethnically diverse sample of male and female adolescents. It was anticipated that body image would have a stronger impact on the depressive symptoms of girls than of boys and that African Americans would be less likely than the other groups to exhibit increased depressive symptomatology as a function of a change toward a more negative body image. Body image, depressive symptoms, and self esteem were each assessed at 2 points in time, approximately 13 mo apart. 877 African American, Asian American, White, Hispanic, or other ethnicity 12-17 yr olds were interviewed during Time 1, and 675 adolescents were reinterviewed for Time 2. Findings showed that girls were more influenced by change in body image than boys, but our assumption that African American girls would be least affected by body image changes was strongly disconfirmed. When the body image of African American teens declines, they experience a significant increase in psychological distress, and this increase is steeper than that observed in girls from other race/ethnicity groups.

Results show that correlates for psychological abuse were race 'Not Black' (i.e., White, Coloured, other), ethnicity 'Not Northern Sotho' (e.g., other ethnic groups), 'Father Employed and Not as Labourer,' 'Mother Employed and Not as Labourer,' 'Stepparent Present During Childhood,' and participant having 'More than 2 Good Friends'; for physical abuse it was 'violence at home not seldom'; for emotional abuse it was 'family income between R1-R30,000; for ritualistic abuse they were 'mother unemployed or labourer' and 'violence at home not seldom.' It is recommended that the above correlates should be taken note of while planning preventive strategies and campaigns against these forms of childhood abuse.

During the 5th yr, Black people were more likely than others to be detained, brought to hospital by the police and given emergency injections. Illness symptoms, social factors (admissions, compulsory detention, police contact), and treatment were also examined.

Ethnicity is thus defined as a multidimensional construct, and multiple aspects of ethnicity-including culture, ethnic identity, and minority status-were hypothesized to regulate students' academic motivation and behavior. The primary goals of these studies were to systematically investigate how ethnicity attributes impair or enhance students' engagement with schooling and academic work. The relationship between Temporal Orientation and Academic Engagement was hypothesized to be mediated by students' experiences of racism and discrimination, perceptions of the usefulness of high educational performance and attainment, ethnic identity, and social engagement. Although the overall model did not fit the data, the results provided support for several of the proposed relationships. The results also indicated that Future Temporal Orientation is an extremely important predictor of other ethnicity and academic engagement and performance variables. The results provided weak support for the existence of the proposed clusters of students, but exploratory cluster analyses indicated that bitemporal students across academic groups tended to have somewhat better grades. Gender appeared to be an important moderating variable: males' academic engagement appeared to be more influenced by their perceptions of oppression and relationships with peers, whereas females' incorporating high achievement as part of their ethnic identity appeared to impact their academic engagement most powerfully.

Results demonstrate that students are exposed to many stressors that contribute to burnout. This study was developed to determine the prevalence of burnout among Counseling Doctoral students, to identify specific factors with which it is associated, and to recommend possible interventions. The author of this research examined responses from 120 doctoral-level students attending CACREP accredited programs in the United States. Level of burnout was assessed by scores on the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Burnout was operationalized according to Maslach's definition and expressed as the following three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Independent variables potentially associated with burnout included place in program, other responsibilities, social support, university workload, financial stress, type of university attending, and therapeutic experience. They were measured via a survey instrument specifically constructed and validated for this study. Multiple linear regression analysis was the primary statistical tool used to determine which factors were independently and significantly associated with burnout. Results indicated that students with relatively low financial status, less social support, living with a significant other and children, or attending a private university had higher levels of emotional exhaustion. Students who reported having little or no difficulty with childcare arrangements, despite having young children who by their nature require more care, were less likely to experience emotional exhaustion. Students who had greater general responsibilities, carried a heavier course load, or had a heavier client load scored higher on depersonalization. Students with young children with adequate childcare arrangements were less likely to experience depersonalization. Students who had more social support, higher financial status, or had a significant other who was also a student reported higher levels of personal accomplishment. Hispanic and other ethnicity students reported significantly lower levels of personal accomplishment. This research has identified several factors associated with burnout that can be translated into interventions nationwide. Most significantly, it has highlighted the utility of personal therapy during graduate training. It also has identified areas in need of further research. By documenting significant relationships between specific stressors and burnout, this study provides justification for the continuation and expansion of research in this area.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Studies of the recognition of faces of an ethnic group different from one's own reveal a robust recognition deficit for faces of the respective out-group (cross-race effect or own-race bias) and a tendency to respond less cautiously with respect to out-group faces. Cross-national comparisons reveal that the cross-race effect appears to be larger among low-contact groups. Although exemplar-based models postulating a multidimensional face space are currently in vogue, some of the more traditional accounts (e.g., the contact hypothesis) should not be dismissed prematurely. An extended exemplar-based model that relates the out-group recognition deficit to the out-group homogeneity effect in social perception and judgment appears promising. An in-group/out-group model (IOM) of face processing is proposed that includes aspects of previous theories and derives new predictions (e.g., a cross-sex or cross-age effect). The IOM attempts to account for the out-group recognition deficit and the more lax response criterion with respect to out-group faces.

An accurate perception of worldviews is a necessary factor in that understanding. This study looked at the extant, reported, and projected worldviews of Hispanics and Anglos. Using the Scale to Assess World Views (SAWV) and the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II (ARSMA-II), students at a southwestern university identified their own worldview and that of the other ethnicity. It was hypothesized that participants would stereotype their classmates, tending to overreport the worldviews traditionally associated with the group. For Hispanics these are an understanding of the goodness of humans, a growing view of activity, collateral human relations, a combined past-present time orientations, and a view of harmony with nature. Anglos are reported to favor a mixed, good and bad, view of humans, a doing activity mode, individual emphasis, future time orientation, and desire for mastery over nature. Anglos and Hispanics were different on 3 of the 11 subscales. Only 3 of 15 subscales showed significant gender effects, and there were no interaction effects for gender and ethnicity. The hypothesis that highly acculturated Hispanics would score closer to the Anglo reported values did not hold for any of the subscales. On the Past and Present worldview subscales, ones traditionally reported for Hispanics, Anglos perceived Hispanics to be significantly more stereotypic than Hispanics self-reported. On the five traditional worldviews for Anglos, the Hispanics perceived Anglos as significantly more stereotypic on all five domains of the SAWV. Future research might more clearly define the construct of worldview and devise empirically tested ways of using the concept.

Using a sample of French- and English-Canadians drawn from the Toronto area, this study provides preliminary evidence showing that ethnic origin, media usage, and other ethnicity indicators vary in terms of the extent to which they are amenable to acculturative pressure.

Specifically, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II, the Attachment Q-Sort, and a Free Play Scale, developed by the investigator for the purposes of the present study, were employed. It was predicted that children in stable foster care (i.e., one or two foster placements) would demonstrate better mental and motor developmental outcomes, show more secure attachment to the caregiver, and demonstrate more integrative and representational play, as well as less disorganized play than children who have had multiple (i.e., three or more) foster care placements. Participants were 24 African American, 5 Caucasian, and 7 ""other ethnicity"" drug-exposed children between the ages of 23 and 48 months who were in foster care placement. Sixty-seven percent were prenatally exposed to cocaine, 22 percent to methamphetamines, and 8 percent to heroin. All of the subjects were followed through a longitudinal research study in an outpatient foster care program at a local hospital. Through this program, the children received intensive case management, developmental, and mental health services for approximately two to three years. No significant differences were found between the multiple and stable placement groups on developmental outcomes, security of attachment, or the quality of play. Exploratory analyses examined the following subgroups: (a) placement with relative versus non relative, (b) ethnicity, (c) type of drug exposure, and (d) length of time in placement. These post hoc analyses revealed three significant findings. Children placed with relative caregivers had higher scores on motor development than children placed in non relative foster homes. Caucasian children demonstrated higher mental development scores than African American children. Children prenatally exposed to methamphetamines were found to have higher mental development scores than children prenatally exposed to cocaine. The results of this study did not suggest that multiple versus stable foster care placement differentiated children on mental and motor developmental outcomes, attachment security, and play quality. Findings from exploratory analyses suggest that, for this sample, other demographic and environmental factors may have contributed more to developmental outcomes. These findings indicate a need for further exploration of the placement stability of drug-exposed children in foster care.

The groups did not have invariant measurement models denoting that the scales did not measure the groups equivalently. However, allowing for differences in the measurement model, both groups' data displayed acceptable fit to a three factor intercorrelated model of the latent variables.

Data were from 4,395 12-80 yr olds in a general population survey. During the month preceding the interview, 1,130 of all respondents had driven after having one or more drinks. Drinking pattern measures included drinking frequency, average drinking quantity, and the variance in the number of drinks consumed per occasion. To assess the relationships of drinking patterns to drinking and driving across age groups, 2 sets of analyses were conducted, one set in which age differences in drinking patterns were statistically controlled and one set in which they were not. Although the statistical control for drinking patterns reduced age differences between gender and ethnic groups, it did not eliminate them. The reduction demonstrated that part of observed group differences in driving after drinking over age among gender and ethnic groups is due to age-related differences in drinking patterns. However, despite controlling drinking patterns young respondents remained more likely to drink and drive. A supplementary analysis of self-reported incidents of driving while intoxicated further indicated that, controlling for drinking patterns, young respondents are most at risk.

Specifically, four issues were examined: (1) whether there are sociocultural differences in children's social behaviors; (2) whether there are differences in the behavioral correlates of peer acceptance for children of different sociocultural groups; (3) whether socioeconomic or ethnic differences in the processes of peer acceptance are affected by homogeneity versus diversity in the sociocultural make-up of the peer environment; and (4) whether the behavioral correlates of liking by same-ethnicity peers are the same as the corresponding correlates of liking by other-ethnicity peers. The sample consisted of 616 third- and fourth-grade children from three socioculturally distinct classroom settings: middle-class, predominantly European-American classrooms; lower-class, predominantly European-American classrooms; and lower-class, predominantly African-American classrooms. Half of the children were boys; approximately one-third were African-American. Measures included sociometric assessments of peer acceptance and behavioral reputation; self-reports of perceived self-competence; scores on standardized academic achievement tests; and teacher ratings of children's social and cognitive competence. Results indicated that the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral correlates of peer acceptance were generally the same across classroom settings. Similarly, few significant differences were found between the correlates of acceptance by same-ethnicity peers and the correlates of acceptance by other-ethnicity peers. However, significant mean differences in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning were found between children in the three different sociocultural settings, with children in more affluent school settings faring more positively on most measures. Overall, the pattern of results did not support the hypothesis that children would be perceived more positively by teachers and peers, and would experience higher self-competence, in classrooms where their sociocultural group represented a majority, rather than a minority, of the population. Interestingly, though, African-American children in middle-class, predominantly European-American classrooms were perceived by peers and teachers as less socially, behaviorally, and academically skilled, than were African-American children in lower-class, predominantly European-American classrooms. These findings are discussed in terms of implications for school integration and intervention programs.

The qualitative study investigated world view expressed in science instruction by conducting periodic observations in two science classrooms over a nine-month period, Semi-structured interviews were conducted with teachers (n = 2) who taught fifth and sixth grade science. Field notes and audio recordings provided data. Teachers were asked to review and comment on all analyzed data. Mainstream texts (n = 2) and texts written by and for Native Americans (n = 3) were examined for examples of expressed or implied world view. To define student world view, 28 Native American students in grades 5-9 were engaged in science activities at the reservation and interviewed singularly and in groups. Adult Native Americans were interviewed and asked to reflect on the educational and cultural norms of the students. Adult Native Americans were asked to review and comment on all analyzed data. Matrices and diagrams compared the worldview expressions obtained from teachers, texts, and students. A narrative described and gave examples of worldview expressions from each source of data. The variable-oriented analysis revealed strong differences in epistemology, preferred methods of teaching and learning, values, temporal/spatial orientation, and perspective of the place of humans in the natural world. Strong differences between teachers and students were also observed in prior knowledge, cultural rules for behavior and language patterns. It is hoped that this study will contribute to an understanding of the cultural basis of world view and the ways in which world view interacts with science instruction.
