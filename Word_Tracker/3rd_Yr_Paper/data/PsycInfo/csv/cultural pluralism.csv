Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Students learning English as an additional language (EAL) in Australian schools frequently struggle with the cultural and linguistic demands of the classroom while concurrently grappling with issues of identity and belonging. This article reports on an investigation of the role primary school visual arts programs, distinct programs with a specialist teacher, in a designated art room, can play in supporting EAL students' identity construction and social transition. At six Melbourne primary schools, classroom observations and teacher and student interviews revealed that the visual art programs offer clear possibilities for enhanced and empowered constructions of identity. This article focuses on four students as case studies, highlighting the powerful role visual arts programs, classrooms and teachers can play in EAL learners' identity construction. On a personal and societal level, identity construction and a positive sense of self are essential in our current era of increased linguistic and cultural pluralism, and this study offers insights into how these inclusive goals can be achieved.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The concept of identity, although quite recent in the social sciences, is one of the few concepts to have been so widely studied and theorized. Psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, even political philosophers, have used the term to shed light on a variety of sociopolitical phenomena, ranging from belonging to exclusion and from stability and homogeneity to social change and cultural pluralism. As such, identity has acquired an array of conflicting meanings, from essentialist notions which focus on unity and distinctiveness to conceptions which emphasize the fragmentation of the modern subject. The challenge in defining identity stems from the fact that it refers to both an individual's sense of self as well as to an individual's relations with others. It is, in other words, a concept that resists the individual-social dichotomy which has traditionally dominated the social sciences in general, and social psychology in particular. In this chapter we adopt a social representations perspective to theorize identity at the social-individual interface. We focus on national identities which have been particularly problematized in the context of growing cultural diversity within nation-states and are often seen as declining or changing. The chapter is structured as follows: we start with a brief account of the theory of social representations and then present our main argument of identity as a social representation embedded in strategic projects. Then, in two different sections, we discuss national identity projects in culturally diverse societies with a particular focus on Britain and Greece. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of these national identity projects for the integration of migrants.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"School belongingness has gained currency among educators and school health professionals as an important determinant of adolescent health. The current cross-sectional study presents the 15 most significant personal and contextual factors that collectively explain 66.4% (two-thirds) of the variability in 12-year old students' perceptions of belongingness in primary school. The study is part of a larger longitudinal study investigating the factors associated with student adjustment in the transition from primary to secondary school. The study found that girls and students with disabilities had higher school belongingness scores than boys, and their typically developing counterparts respectively; and explained 2.5% of the variability in school belongingness. The majority (47.1% out of 66.4%) of the variability in school belongingness was explained by student personal factors, such as social acceptance, physical appearance competence, coping skills, and social affiliation motivation; followed by parental expectations (3% out of 66.4%), and school-based factors (13.9% out of 66.4%) such as, classroom involvement, task-goal structure, autonomy provision, cultural pluralism, and absence of bullying. Each of the identified contributors of primary school belongingness can be shaped through interventions, system changes, or policy reforms.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter introduces the role of cultural dynamics in the digital age, thus explaining the theoretical and practical concepts of organizational culture, cultural values and belief systems, material culture and artifacts, language and communication systems, cultural interpenetration, deterritorialization, cultural pluralism, and hybridization; the categorization of cultural dimensions; and the application of cultural dynamics in the modern business world. Cultural influences are changing dramatically as cultures are no longer dependent on local resources to formulate their characteristic tastes, preferences, and behavior and are increasingly linked across vast geographic distances by modern communication media. Membership in a culture adapts to new cultural contexts while transporting elements of one culture to another. As membership in a culture becomes increasingly transitional, unique elements are less clearly demarcated or distinctive. Understanding the role of cultural dynamics in the digital age will significantly enhance organizational performance and achieve business goals in global business environments.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In this chapter, we explore storytelling among the Veekuhane of Botswana in general, and more specifically, we wish to highlight the pedagogical potential of these narratives/stories in transmitting cultural ideas to children in an obviously multilingual and multicultural educational environment. More important, we also wish to stress the promotion of diversity and social justice in a world that is increasingly conflicted and polarized, due in part to the poor management and opportunistic manipulation of cultural pluralism. The case of Rwanda readily comes to mind. Put differently, in using a sample of Veekuhane narratives, the chapter seeks to show how these stories could be deployed in promoting social justice in line with the country's Vision 2016 Pillars of a moral and tolerant; safe and secure; compassionate, just and caring; and a united and proud nation. Using ideas from social justice, the chapter posits that narratives are one of the many tools schools can use as a starting point for children to begin to appreciate the multicultural reality of their existence and subsequently its complex dynamics. The chapter is organized as follows: we begin by justifying the choice of stories and then sketch out the theoretical background in which we highlight Botswana's language situation and how it departs from the basic tenets of social justice and its Vision 2016. We then analyze two stories to show how their teaching could be explored for the inauguration of a more tolerant and united nation.

By analyzing the language choices of Haitian radio producers in the city, this study asks how members of the Haitian radioscape draw on the ideological markings of different languages in order to secure and negotiate their community's position within Quebec and Canada. Representing a community of approximately 75,000 immigrants, Haitian media producers provide a vital bridge between home country and host society, enabling the community to define itself both culturally and linguistically within Montreal's aural landscape. Because of Haiti's history with the French language, Haitian immigrants have traditionally been viewed as especially compatible with Quebec's definition of itself as a distinct French-speaking society. However, the classification of Haitians as French-speakers is not unproblematic. In Haiti, everyone speaks Kreyol while only 5-7% of the population is fluent in French. Reflecting Haiti's linguistic repertoire, six of the seven Haitian-staffed radio teams in Montreal broadcast in Kreyol. In contrast, Radio Union, the only station that features around the clock programming targeted at the Haitian population, broadcasts exclusively in French. While Radio Union takes pride in being the only French-language ethnic radio in North America, its language policy presumably excludes many potential listeners, creating a somewhat ironic situation in that the voice of the Haitian population in Montreal speaks French. Drawing on data culled between 2008 to 2014, including twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork at Radio Union in 2010-2011, this study investigates 1) the everyday work and linguistic practices that contribute to generating audience-appropriate programming and representing an image of a plural Quebec within Haitian radio, 2) the consequences of on-air language choice on the daily operations of the radio station, and 3) the language ideologies undergirding and shaping French and Kreyol language choice at the radio station both on- and off-air, and how they are made evident and renegotiated through the language practices of both Haitian radio hosts and their listeners.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Preserving indigenous culture and practices remains a great challenge for indigenous groups living in a pluralistic, westernized, modernized/post-modernized, and globalized society. With the different elements of social change interacting with the traditional knowledge, systems and practices, it is imperative to look at the risks and changes experienced by indigenous groups in relation to its culture. This paper narrates the presence of syncretism of traditional and contemporary practices in the rituals and music of the Ibaloi community and tries to present the possibility of harmonious interface between the modern quotidian and indigenous life in an attempt to pose minimal risks in the relationship. Rituals in the culturally pluralistic society in the Philippines-Loakan, Baguio City-are still executed and observed at present but the elements of which and other preparations are being lessened because of practicality and shift in beliefs. Nonetheless, these systems and practices still exist because of the meanings attached by the people and their socio-cultural function - as social structures and institutions of social coherence and solidarity-and their outlook about the changes and preservation of performances and rituals in the Ibaloi society.

Vol.75(9-A(E)),2015, pp. No Pagination Specified.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"Convivencia, or conviviality/coexistence, represents a pivotal node in Spanish ideologies of multiculturalism. Touted as the legacy of interreligious harmony in Al-Andalus (A.D. 711-1492), contemporary pedagogical convivencia involves policies, curricula, and activities which idealize distinct ways of communicating and enacting egalitarianism across differences. This has become important as Spain struggles with increased cultural pluralism as a result of foreign immigration. Drawing on twelve months' fieldwork at three secondary schools in the municipality of El Ejido (Almeria), I approach education as a focal sphere in which to examine the daily construction and maintenance of this ideal. Specifically, I argue that the universalist bent of contemporary convivencia pedagogies tends to obscure and invalidate minority student perspectives. Moroccan youth, who are stereotypically associated with patriarchy, piety, and cultural traditionalism, found themselves at odds with the values most fervently promoted in convivencia lessons, especially gender equality. One unintended consequence of these educational interventions was that intolerance persisted not despite, but through, lessons on tolerance-a troubling finding for a place like El Ejido, which has seen some of the worst interracial violence in Europe. Audio recordings collected during democratic education classes and related activities reveal patterns in teacher-student and student-student interactions that speak to how convivencia was constructed (and undermined) as a discursive performance of progressivism. Stance prompting, stance assessment, and stance attribution comprised tools that allowed teachers to defend their situational and moral authority while compelling students toward self-reflection and empathy. These repertoires simultaneously acted as exclusionary mechanisms toward Moroccan youth, who were positioned as ""others"" unqualified to speak as progressive subjects. Using analytic frameworks from linguistic anthropology and building on studies of diversity and civic education, I argue that the dialogues analyzed in this dissertation represent tensions ever-present in projects of democratic equality. While the shape of these efforts have much to do with Spain's mottled history with democracy, these findings hold significance for educators everywhere insofar as heartfelt support for seemingly unassailable ideals-including human rights, gender equality, and racial equality-can smuggle in ethnocentrist biases.

Researchers have offered various conceptualizations of how individuals manage their complex identities, while others have identified links between cognitive complexity and acceptance of outgroups. This paper integrates the two bodies of work by positing a route by which personal identity conflicts may lead to cognitive and cultural pluralism. For individuals committed to multiple identities perceived as conflicting, the intra-psychic experience of value conflicts may lead to a recognition of self-complexity, which is then transposed from the personal domain to the social one and expressed as a pluralistic attitude towards others. This argument find support in a study of Israeli Jewish Orthodox psychoanalytic therapists who belong to what they perceive as non-pluralistic religious groups, yet express value pluralism, which they attribute to their complex identities. One of the educational implications of this study is that facilitating engagement with internal complexity, multiple identities and personal value conflicts may promote pluralistic thinking for individuals in religious societies.

The author argues that there were recurrent efforts to maintain Irish identity by ensuring the young would understand their Irish and Catholic heritage and that adults often based this identity on the themes of Irish nationalism. Yet Irish-Americans understood that they had to demonstrate Irish loyalty to the United States, so they attempted to blend Irish and American identities in their progeny, articulating an early vision of cultural pluralism for American society. This research contributes to understandings of the invention of ethnicity and ethnic endurance in the United States and how immigrants use conceptions of the meaning of ""American"" with their national backgrounds as they create identities for their descendants. This dissertation also illuminates the importance of children and ideas about childhood to the development of ethnicity in the United States. But it also has broader meanings for the ways in which religion, ethnicity, and nationality affect the transition of immigrant progeny from the world of their parents to that of the United States and how the children of immigrants eventually become American ethnic groups.

The public school classroom in the United States has been getting more diverse, linguistically, culturally, racially, and ethnically. Classrooms in South Korea are also becoming linguistically, culturally, racially, and ethnically diverse because of the fast growth of immigration since the 1990s. In nation-states, implementing theories, practices, ideals, values of multicultural education in curricula is a responsibility for the wellbeing and academic success of all children. This dissertation examined how social studies textbooks in South Korea and the United States implement suggestions that multicultural education scholars recommend for cultural pluralism, educational equality, and social justice to reduce gaps between theories and practices. Five social studies textbooks were analyzed. Since the Seattle (WA) Public Schools recently adopted only one textbook for use in 2012-2013 in regular U.S. history classes, History Alive! Pursuing American Ideals was analyzed. Two Korea History and two Society and Culture texts randomly selected from the approved list by the South Korean Ministry of Education were analyzed as the combination of the two subjects is more equivalent to U.S. history. This study found the selected textbooks did an inadequate job of adopting multicultural education theories suggested by scholars although there are minor differences among the three sets of textbooks. Although there are not many, few stereotypical images are still found in all three sets of textbooks. Textbooks are dominated by stories of mainstreamers in each country. The coverage of ethnic minorities is often limited to roles and topics related to racial issues such as discrimination. There are no stories of how different minority groups interact with each other, and there is practically no contemporary coverage of social actions by ethnic minorities for social justice.

Using the latest nationally representative quantitative data, this dissertation attempts to fill this gap in the literature by systematically examining the cultural, socioeconomic, structural, and political adaptation of post-1991 Eastern European immigrants in the United States. Two research questions will guide this study. First, to what extent do post-1991 Eastern European immigrants in the United States adapt culturally, socioeconomically, structurally, and politically to American life? Second, what are the major determinants of cultural, socioeconomic, structural, and political adaptation of post-1991 Eastern European immigrants in the United States? This dissertation is the first comprehensive study of the adaptation experience of post-1991 Eastern European immigrants in the United States. The study simultaneously examines the cultural, socioeconomic, structural, and political adaptation of these new immigrants. In addition to an important methodological contribution and policy implications, the project reviews contesting perspectives of immigrant adaptation and develops a theoretical base for understanding Eastern European immigration. Since different Eastern European groups adapt to their new lives in the United States differently, their adaptation experiences can be best explained by different theoretical frameworks. Data from the Department of Homeland Security were used to describe the recent trends and patterns of immigration from Eastern Europe to the United States. The 2006-2010 American Community Survey (ACS), the 2008-2010 Civic Engagement Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CES-CPS), and the 2002-2010 Voting and Registration Supplement of the Current Population Survey (VRS-CPS) collected by the U.S. Bureau of the Census were used to address aspects of cultural, socioeconomic, structural, and political adaptation of new Eastern European immigrants. Ordinary least squares regression and logistic regression were used to test the hypotheses. The results show that new Eastern European immigrants have achieved a relatively high degree of English proficiency, and being recent immigrants, they have a higher likelihood of retaining their native language than other immigrant groups. Overall, new Eastern European immigrants tend to be highly educated and professional, but their average personal income is surprisingly low. Participation in civic organizations and neighborhood interaction of new Eastern European immigrants is somewhat limited, indicating that a relatively high degree of cultural and socioeconomic adaptation might not result in better structural adaptation for these immigrants. The naturalization rate among new Eastern European immigrants is comparable to that of American immigrants in general, but it is lower than the naturalization rate among other European and Asian immigrants. Voting behavior of new Eastern European immigrants is similar to other American immigrants. Overall, it appears that new Eastern European immigrants adapt well culturally, socioeconomically, structurally, and politically, but there are cross-group differences in their adaptation. In addition, empirical evidence suggests that new Eastern European immigrants have become only partially assimilated in the United States, while partially maintaining their ethnic cultures. Therefore, assimilation theory has no relevance when explaining their diverse adaptation paths and experiences. However, cultural pluralism theory, revisionist assimilation theory, and segmented assimilation theory appear to be applicable to the experiences of various Eastern European groups across different adaptation dimensions.

Paying particular attention to asset pedagogy's failures to remain dynamic and critical in a constantly evolving global world, they offer a vision that builds on the crucial work of the past toward a CSP that keeps pace with the changing lives and practices of youth of color. The authors argue that CSP seeks to perpetuate and foster linguistic, literate, and cultural pluralism as part of the democratic project of schooling and as a needed response to demographic and social change. Building from their critique, Paris and Alim suggest that CSP's two most important tenets are a focus on the plural and evolving nature of youth identity and cultural practices and a commitment to embracing youth culture's counterhegemonic potential while maintaining a clear-eyed critique of the ways in which youth culture can also reproduce systemic inequalities.

Development efforts and Nepal's recent armed conflict, in particular, introduced novel technologies and ideologies that affected Humli vulnerabilities. This dissertation is based on field research comparing two Hindu villages in northwest Nepal during 2009 and 2010. One village had more extensive ties to development than the other, and these villagers and other change agents co-created transitional contexts of vulnerability in the post-conflict setting of rural Nepal. An armed conflict dominated the political landscape in Nepal for nearly ten years, ostensibly to uplift downtrodden members of society. Humlis who joined the Maoists during the insurgency had higher average incomes and higher overall socioeconomic statuses than those who did not join. This research challenges conventional wisdom about how `people's wars' motivate individuals of different social positions. Indeed, villagers' responses to development workers and Maoist combatants were surprisingly similar. Certain development processes had de-stabilized parts of the region, and contributed both materially and ideologically to the vulnerabilities people experienced during and following the conflict. The rise of Nepali democracy and the development industry since the early 1990s has presented new social networking and resource options to Humlis as well as exposing them to new risks and vulnerabilities. The villagers who resisted some of these novelties had better food security and health outcomes and less divisive experiences of the conflict than villagers more engaged with development. Based on over a year of fieldwork (participant observation, surveys, interviews, and focus groups), statistical and ArcGIS analyses represent landscapes of health, health-seeking behavior, conflict, and kin networks in northwestern Nepal. These findings explore the integration of neoliberal development in this post-conflict setting in which cultural pluralism, caste, Hinduism and cultural conservatism all shape decision-making. They reveal the social and material resource conditions conducive to engagement in risky behavior in a politically and ecologically diverse and fragile context, with implications for Nepal's, and by extension other rapidly developing regions', ongoing development and contexts of vulnerability.

This study explores how, in the years following the 9/11 attacks and the declaration of the ""War on Terror,"" American Muslims have inhabited an ambiguous position as U.S. citizens. From American government policy statements to images circulated through the media, Muslims have been represented as ""terrorists"" and Islam as culturally ""Other"" to ""Western"" values and traditions. In post-9/11 America, it has become increasingly difficult to associate Muslims with notions of ""true Americanness"" or patriotism. This has created significant dilemmas for American Muslims who share a deep sense of national identity and a belief in the civic ideals of liberal democracy. This study asks, how are young American Muslims-defined as potential ""enemies"" in moral and racialized terms-constructing the grounds for political and religious subjectivity? Based on two years of ethnographic fieldwork in New York City, this study examines the cultural politics of belonging and identity among second and third generation South Asian American Muslim artists and activists in post-9/11 America. It explores the day-to-day experiences and strategic practices of American Muslims coming together through cultural activism and citizenship practices to simultaneously claim and redefine American belonging. Such negotiations demonstrate the limits of tolerance in Western liberal democracies, and expose how purportedly secular states constantly regulate when and how Muslim ""difference"" is practiced and expressed in public life. The study shows that despite these challenges, young American Muslims are actively redefining Islam as American in multiple and emerging public spheres.

This dissertation seeks to re-interpret Tammany in the context of a transatlantic Irish experience of hunger, dislocation, and alienation. Irish immigrants brought with them distinct political narratives which were incorporated into Tammany Hall's pragmatic but progressive ideology during the first quarter of the 20th Century. These political narratives, centered on the experience of powerlessness and oppression in Ireland and inextricably linked to Catholicism, led Irish immigrants to regard reformers in New York as American versions of their traditional enemies, the well-born Anglo-Protestant. The Irish arrived in New York with an understanding of the power of mass politics thanks to Daniel O'Connell's campaign for Catholic Emancipation in the 1820s. Few studies of Tammany Hall attempt to link O'Connell's mobilization of the Irish peasantry to Tammany's ability to turn out the vote, especially after the Famine exodus of 1845-52. Likewise, the critical role of John Hughes, the first Catholic archbishop of New York and a native of Ireland, remains outside the story of Irish-American politics, despite the key role he played in organizing the Irish vote behind transatlantic grievances. This dissertation seeks to show how a particularly Irish experience in both Ireland and New York helped to mobilize a new kind of politics which emphasized cultural pluralism, populist rhetoric, and practical solutions to social injustice. A child of a Famine immigrant, Charles Francis Murphy, transformed Tammany into a force for social change during the Progressive Era. Murphy's forgotten role in nurturing politicians such as Alfred E. Smith and Robert Wagner has been forgotten, but this dissertation will show that his embrace of change helped set the stage for the rise of Franklin Roosevelt and the implementation of the New Deal.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) The classic paradigm ""think globally and act locally"" is discovering a new relevance in the context of social development, as it provides a useful perspective on addressing the needs of nations as complex and diverse as India. In order to understand a country's motivation for change and social action, it is first necessary to understand the history of the people and their way of life. Social Work and Social Development: Perspectives from India and the United States compares India and the United States' approaches to social work and social development. The book highlights the similarities between the two countries, especially the cultural pluralism, democratic political structures, and social welfare policy commitments that make possible an inclusionary exchange of knowledge in the fields of social work and social development. The book's unique multicultural, multilevel approach integrates diverse perspectives, and provides a faceted picture of social structures and change in both countries. The goals are to ultimately move beyond the ethnocentric mantra of applying ""developed"" solutions to ""developing"" problems and redefine the parameters for understanding people and problems in international social work. The main features of this book include: (1) A unique framework for international comparisons that can be applied beyond the United States and India, (2) Contributions from Indian and US experts in social work, sociology, theology, philosophy, and women's studies, and (3) Concept overview preceding each part and discussion questions following each chapter.

I argue that Locke's consistent attention to culture was an intentional move to utilize culture as a site of resistance against racist ideology. This move allowed for resistance on two fronts. First, prioritizing culture over biology allowed Locke to redefine race as a sociocultural phenomenon, effectively discrediting biological conceptions of race and their inherent biological determinism that dehumanized African Americans. Second, Locke's promotion of African American cultural products aimed to prove black humanity by showing African Americans to be producers of culture. I argue that for Locke race is a cultural product generated by the beliefs, values, practices and traditions of a group. Race is perpetuated over time through social, not biological inheritance. Locke was especially cognizant of how culture and the arts could contribute to racial formation. I argue that art is significant in Locke's vindication project in that it offers a way of redefining perceptions of black people by means of cultural products. These products support the vindication of black humanity by showing that black people are contributors to world culture. Further, I argue that Locke promoted African American cultural products as a means of engaging in cultural reciprocity with other groups. Finally, looking beyond vindication I examine the concepts of race conservation and post-racialism in light of Locke's conception of race and commitments to cultural pluralism. The debate over whether or not to conserve race typically has been framed by W. E. B. Du Bois' essay ""The Conservation of Races."" Though Locke was a contemporary of Du Bois and offered his own race theory, he has been noticeably excluded from debates on race conservation. I argue that this exclusion is unwarranted. Drawing from his writings on race and culture I situate Locke within the debate. In closing I examine the concept of post-racialism and consider the question of conservation of the notion of race in a ""post-racial"" world.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Telling Stories in Two Languages: Multiple Approaches to Understanding English-Japanese Bilingual Children's Narratives by Masahiko Minami (see record 2011-09579-000). One of the most significant endeavors for children with respect to language and literacy development is to improve narrative ability. How this narrative ability is developed by bilingual children has not been extensively explored. Therefore, this book is a welcomed addition to the field of bilingualism not only for interested researchers but also for parents and school teachers/administrators in order to understand how narrative abilities are developed in two separate languages by bilingual children. The book consists of a compilation of several narrative studies conducted with the same 40 English-Japanese children (aged 6-12 years) living in San Francisco. Using the same narrative data, each chapter analyzes different aspects of the narratives to investigate both their universal and language-specific characteristics. The book is divided into nine chapters. The author takes an invariable position throughout the book; bilingualism is an asset which the education system needs to value in order to nurture the linguistic and cultural pluralism these children bring to school. Overall, in spite of a few minor editing errors, the book does provide the reader with invaluable resources such as complete references, subject index, and author index. This book is a great addition to the field of bilingualism research. Both researchers whose scholarship lies on narrative development of bilingual children and parents and school teachers/administrators who are concerned with bilingual children's language and literacy development can benefit tremendously from the series of research presented in this book.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper investigates the ways languages are used in Philadelphia Chinatown through qualitative content analysis of 330 photos. Examining the linguistic landscape of public spaces exposes issues of linguistic tensions, language vitality, and language shift in multilingual settings. While Chinese in the form of Mandarin is highly publicized, thereby placing disproportionate emphasis upon one language over others, Philadelphia Chinatown shows diversity, coexistence, and creative uses of multiple Chinese languages alongside English. The signage suggests linguistic rescaling connecting real and imagined audiences, conforming to broader 'Chinese' linguistic norms while localized to connect to a range of Chineses. We show how linguistic and cultural pluralism of 'Chinese' have always existed-and continue to exist-and the importance of developing socially sensitive literacy pedagogy, especially when there is a mismatch between the informal, community-level signage and what is formally taught in 'Chinese' language classrooms in the U.S. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).",http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/wll.15.1.06leu,"linguistic & cultural pluralism, Chinese languages, language literacy education","*Language

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The United States is a classic country of immigration that has long defined itself as having been built by successive waves of immigrants. Social scientists often speak of a multicultural or cultural pluralist 'model of integration' in the US that recognizes, sometimes even celebrates, diversity at the same time as it assumes and expects immigrants and their children to assimilate and become American. This article complicates the picture. It brings in history to show how national models of integration in the US are not stable but have changed over time. In fact, the very incorporation of earlier waves of immigrants in the past has contributed to these changes. It also considers local-level variation-that is, differences among US cities in policies as well as in widespread understandings about the integration of immigrants. Despite these complications, there are clearly ways that national models of integration matter in the US, which is the theme of the concluding section.

Vol.73(1-A),2012, pp. 242.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"Despite the rapid growth of the Nepalese population, presently very little is known about the Nepalese in the United States. This dissertation examines the adaptation of the Nepalese in the United States. It focuses on the following three research questions: 1. How do the Nepalese in the United States adapt culturally, structurally, maritally, identificationally, and receptionally to American life? 2. What factors influence the cultural, structural, marital, identificational, and receptional adaptation of the Nepalese in the United States? 3. Which factors play a more important role in the adaptation of the Nepalese in the United States? The theoretical framework for guiding this study is built upon the synthesis of the following theories: classical assimilation, melting pot, cultural pluralism, selective assimilation, revisionist assimilation, and transnationalism. I proposed a series of hypotheses related to Nepalese's cultural, structural, identificational, marital, and receptional adaptation for testing. The data were collected through an online survey using the online survey software tool, PsychData. The sample (N=768) was collected from the Nepalese who were 18 years old or older and currently living in the United States. I tested the hypotheses using ordinary least squares regression, logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and ordinal regression depending on the measurements of the dependent variables. The results show that the majority of the Nepalese celebrated both Hindu and American holidays/festivals. Nepali was the dominant language spoken at home and with children. Most of them had friendship with Nepalese and socialized with Nepalese. The majority of the Nepalese interacted with whites in the workplace and lived in white neighborhoods. The majority of the respondents had a Nepalese spouse and consistently preferred to marry Nepali, if given a choice. More than half of the respondents would allow their children to marry non-Nepalese. The Nepalese not only identified themselves as Nepalese, but also felt closeness to their own ethnic group. The majority of the Nepalese had been mistaken as ""Hispanics."" Half of the respondents had been treated well in the host country but discriminated sometimes, and had never had unwelcomed feelings. The results also reveal that age of entry is a significant predictor of celebrating Hindu festivals, attending Hindu religious services, attending Nepali functions, having a Nepalese spouse, disallowing children to marry non-Nepalese, and identifying self as Nepalese. Legal status significantly contributes to celebrating American holidays, identifying self as Nepalese American or Asian American, and facing less discrimination and prejudice. Length of stay increases proficiency in English language: it facilitates living in white neighborhoods, having friendship and socialization with whites, obtaining membership in Nepalese organizations, marrying a non-Nepalese, and self-identifying as Nepalese American or American/other. Education in the United States facilitates working mostly with whites and obtaining membership in American organizations. Travel to homeland increases attending Hindu religious services, being close to Nepalese, working mostly with whites, and living in white neighborhoods. Sending remittance is associated with closeness to one's own ethnic group. Similarly, reading Nepali newspapers contributes to attendance of Hindu religious services, attendance of Nepali functions, cooking of Nepali food, retention of ethnic language, self-identification as Nepalese, and closeness to one's own ethnic group. It is found that the relative importance of the predictors in predicting Nepalese adaptation varies depending on the dependent variables. Age of entry has the strongest effect on celebrating Hindu festivals, attending Hindu religious services, attending Nepali functions, and disallowing children to ma...

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Seventeen years ago Gloria Ladson-Billings (1995) published the landmark article ""Toward a Theory of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy,"" giving a coherent theoretical statement for resource pedagogies that had been building throughout the 1970s and 1980s. I, like countless teachers and university-based researchers, have been inspired by what it means to make teaching and learning relevant and responsive to the languages, literacies, and cultural practices of students across categories of difference and (in)equality. Recently, however, I have begun to question if the terms ""relevant"" and ""responsive"" are really descriptive of much of the teaching and research founded upon them and, more importantly, if they go far enough in their orientation to the languages and literacies and other cultural practices of communities marginalized by systemic inequalities to ensure the valuing and maintenance of our multiethnic and multilingual society. In this essay, I offer the term and stance of culturally sustaining pedagogy as an alternative that, I believe, embodies some of the best research and practice in the resource pedagogy tradition and as a term that supports the value of our multiethnic and multilingual present and future. Culturally sustaining pedagogy seeks to perpetuate and foster-to sustain-linguistic, literate, and cultural pluralism as part of the democratic project of schooling. In the face of current policies and practices that have the explicit goal of creating a monocultural and monolingual society, research and practice need equally explicit resistances that embrace cultural pluralism and cultural equality.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Comment/Reply,"Comments on an article by Joshua Marvle Phelps et al. (see record 2012-06930-001). The article, based on data from the newspaper language in Norway since 1984, contains a number of interesting observations and important findings. There can be no disagreement about the main conclusion, which is well documented, namely that the preoccupation with immigration and the fraught relationship of cultural pluralism to classic Norwegian nationhood has grown perceptibly in importance since the mid-1980s. There is one main change in the grammar of othering as it is practised in Norway, which is-somewhat surprisingly-overlooked by the authors, namely the slow but very perceptible shift from race to religion as the main marker of difference. Muslims are increasingly associated with values and practices that are inimical to Norwegian identity. The new right is viciously anti-Muslim. The new anti-Muslim ideology has several interesting features. First, its adherents are otherwise ideologically diverse, ranging from classical Marxists to libertarians and state-centric nationalists. Second, it recruits largely from segments of the middle class where there is a feeling of downward mobility, marginalisation and disenfranchisement. Third, taken to its extremes, this ideology relinquishes democratic procedures and declares war on The Other.

How do teachers ensure that students understand their place as actors on a dynamic and changing world stage? How do students learn to make decisions and engage locally and globally as citizens of the U.S. and members of the world community? Global education, the field of study developed to meet these goals, aims to ""develop in youth the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to live effectively in a world possessing limited natural resources and characterized by ethnic diversity, cultural pluralism, and increasing interdependence"" (National Council for the Social Studies, 2005). Global educators have developed a number of approaches to help elementary, middle and high school students perceive the world as an interconnected system. The study of global interdependence leads to the need to understand diverse cultures, cultural interactions, and human conflicts. In the sections that follow several strategies are explicated that teachers use to infuse global perspectives into the social studies through different grade levels and courses. Elements of global education can unify diverse time periods and world regions and center students' study of local issues within a global framework (Merryfield & Wilson, 2005).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"On March 8, 1979, Iranian women took to the streets of Tehran for International Women's Day. This article examines American media representations of the weeklong protests and explores how the event occasioned the emergence of a distinctly American-and deeply racialized-""discourse of the veil,"" in which ""Islam"" was rendered a national catchphrase for terror and the figure of the ""Poor Muslim Woman"" entered U.S. cultural discourse as a symbol of a new world order. Through analysis of U.S. media coverage, this piece tracks how discourses of second-wave feminism, a post-civil rights rhetoric of racial and cultural pluralism, and late-Cold War logics of secularism and liberal democracy intersected to create a racial-orientalist discourse of the veil, which would subsequently be deployed to justify U.S. military aggression in the Middle East while perpetuating state violence against women, immigrants, and people of color throughout the 1980s and into the post-9/11 era.

The purpose of this research was to examine the nature, values, and teaching-learning strategies of the North Jersey Homeschool Association (NJHSA) Chorale. This case study, conducted over a period of three months, chronicled numerous musical and social interactions of the NJHSA Chorale. Analyses of the data revealed four themes related to this organization's nature, values, and teaching-learning processes: care, community, cultural pluralism, and spirituality. The conclusions of the study include (but are not limited to) the following: the aims and values of the NJHSA Chorale resonate with central issues in contemporary educational philosophy and with central aims of community music in particular (e.g., music making for life-long learning and for community well-being).

Vol.72(3-A),2011, pp. 1090.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"This study focuses on discourses of nation, race, and memory in present-day Quebec society through an analysis of the celebrations of Quebec City's 400th anniversary in 2008. My analyses locate these commemorative practices within the broader context of a perceived crisis of Quebecois identity. I identify the modes through which difference was discursively constructed in relation to culture, race, and gender in Quebec. I then adopt a theoretical framework that examines the relationship among public commemoration, nation-building, and subject formation in Quebec. Specifically, I examine the high-profile Rencontres spectacle, several museum and art exhibits, a theatrical production, a number of musical concerts, a variety of policy documents, various protocol events, and the Quebec nationalist and anarchist protest movements in relation to each other. I argue that the Quebec 400 is best understood as a set of subject-making practices that sought to define an ideal Quebecois subject through norms of belonging that prioritized French colonial heroes and subjugated indigenous and non-French Others. Commemorative practices at the Quebec 400 celebrations articulated the liberal discourse of cultural pluralism common in Western liberal democracies post-1980s in ways that effectively positioned the normative Quebecois subject as the enlightened, generous, and reasoned patron of cultural diversity. Commemoration also operated as a creative, festive, spectacularized, and thus seemingly innocent mode of constituting national subjects in 21st century Quebec, relying as it did on territoriality and kinship relations to interpellate subjects into a national project in Quebec and to locate them in a hierarchy of belonging. The Quebec 400 was also characterized by the performance of intimate relationships between France and Quebec throughout 2008. The transnational dimensions of the normative Quebecois subject were premised on a shared understanding of the colonial-settler project in Quebec, organized around notions of whiteness, civilization, and territory.

The marriages between American soldiers and Japanese women became controversial subjects in both the United States and Japan because they crossed the constructed racial line as miscegenation. They also became an ideological symbol of war politics between the victor and the defeated. This postwar period was the first time that American soldiers and Japanese women became so intimate that their marriages became the subject of much discussion and concern in the U.S.-Japan history. This dissertation examines how such controversial marriages between American soldiers and Japanese women became subjects that invigorated American Imperialism at the beginning of Cold War. First, I analyze how the intimacy between American soldiers and Japanese women became visible within the shift of the political relationship between the United States and Japan as they moved from wartime enemy to postwar allies; as well as analyzing representations of intimacy between American soldiers and Japanese women in the early 50's. I situate configuration of American soldier husbands within the U.S. occupation of Japan as liberation and rehabilitation whereby the marriages were understood as loving projects that liberated Japanese ""enslaved"" wives. Second, this dissertation captures the shifting moments when the United States realized its cultural pluralism whereby it asserted its capability of accommodating people regardless of race and confirmed its democratic principle. I analyze how mixed racial families consisting of American soldier husbands, Japanese wives, and their ""mixed blood"" children that were impossible subjects of miscegenation became possible subjects as a model family who self-evidently invigorate American cultural pluralism during the Cold War.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Multicultural education is a curriculum reform movement expressive of the mainstream of the American sociopolitical tradition. As a reform movement multicultural education has attempted to redress issues of power relationships as expressed in the ideology of the long-established general education program inherent in most U.S. schools, but particularly as nested in the language arts and social studies curriculum. Given its narrative orientation, a paradigmatic definition of multicultural education is extremely difficult. A scholarly attempt at definition is as challenging as herding cats, because the movement is defined not in terms of a common agenda as much as it is defined in terms of opposition to the status quo. Fortunately, one of the more enduring categorizations of the multicultural tradition over the past two decades was created by Sleeter and Grant. Currently in its fifth edition, Making Choices for Multicultural Education draws on five approaches to multicultural education identified by Gibson: 1. education of the culturally different; 2. education about cultural differences; 3. education for cultural pluralism; 4. bicultural education; and 5. multicultural education. Sleeter and Grant, however, move beyond the approach of Gibson to create their own typology: 1. teaching the exceptional and culturally different; 2. human relations approach; 3. single-group studies approach; 4. multicultural education approach; and 5. multicultural social justice approach. The attraction of the Sleeter and Grant approach is that it attempts to capture the evolving nature of the multicultural education reform movement as it has refocused from issues of cultural exclusion to issues of power. This historical view of the multicultural education reform movement gives directionality to the drift of reform, and accordingly provides a vantage point from which to anticipate difficulties for the movement in the future. This chapter will use the Sleeter and Grant categorization as a template for surveying the movement, and as a vantage point for looking ahead. A second organizing principle for this chapter is the dimensional typology provided by James Banks. Banks identifies five dimensions of educational outcomes of particular relevance to multicultural education. These are: 1. content integration; 2. knowledge construction; 3. prejudice reduction; 4. equity pedagogy; and 5. empowering school culture. Drawing on these educational outcomes as they are expressed in each of the approaches of the Sleeter and Grant typology, processes of comparison across approaches will be facilitated.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study builds on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 93 child welfare workers employed in public child welfare agencies in the United States, Norway and England, and examines their perceptions of working with racial and ethnic minority families in contrast to White service users. Almost all workers reported on differences. In the United States, workers regarded cultural pluralism as a given and considered it an inherent feature of their work, regardless of the racial and/or ethnic background of the family. Further, they identified poverty, racism, and lack of feelings of entitlement as dimensions to practicing with minority families. A few mentioned language as an issue. The views of workers in the U.S. stand in stark contrast to the perceptions of workers in both England and Norway. They thought that communication challenges constituted a major problem, and that minority clients' lack of language proficiency and knowledge about society and social systems made it difficult for workers to understand families' meaning and intent (Kriz & Skivenes, 2009; 2010b). We discuss how caseworkers' perceptions may influence their decisions and affect minority disproportionality in the child protection system and analyze what factors may account for the cross-country differences we found. We also relate our findings to the broader question of citizenship and social rights in American society.

Survey data was collected from 64 immigrant Asian fathers and from 25 teachers of the fathers' 4th-6th grade children. Ten of the fathers also were interviewed. Fathers were predominately Korean, college-educated, and upper-middle class. Children were reported to perform well academically and be well-adjusted to school. Fathers perceived more work-family facilitation than conflict. Facilitation was related to fathers' positive well-being and reports of children's positive school achievement and adaptation. More conflict related to poorer well-being and reportedly poorer school adaptation. Fathers were moderately involved with their children. Greater homework and interpersonal involvement were related to more school enjoyment and better achievement, respectively. Greater direct school involvement was related to higher school anxiety for children. Less acculturated men were less likely to be involved with their children's education and more likely to have less life satisfaction. Asian fathers are not homogenous in their attitudes or behaviors, and their specific cultural values and time in America should be considered when examining this population. Qualitative interviews revealed that, fathers' wives were pivotal in facilitating or hindering their work-family balance by providing support. Fathers had desire to be involved and to mentor. However, they felt loss in the cultural pluralism that fails to provide them guidelines on fatherhood. Fathers' sense of financial responsibility to their families motivated them to do well at work. Those that experienced work-family facilitation were likely to find fulfillment at their work, or learned to draw boundaries between work and family. Those that lacked boundaries often felt frustrated at their ineffective behaviors. Not all conflict was negative in nature, some was the result of intentional greater involvement with their families. Taken together, fathers that perceived work-family facilitation were more likely to be involved and have positive well-being, which were related to children's achievement and adaptation to school. Additionally, less acculturated fathers may face challenges in defining their father role. Results have implications for educational and economic policies that address the lives of immigrant families.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Muslim American youth: Understanding hyphenated identities through multiple methods (qualitative studies in psychology) by Selcuk Sirin and Michelle Fine (see record 2008-09997-000). In this book, the authors use multiple research methods, surveys, interviews, focus groups, and life history interviews, to investigate the psychosocial implications of young Muslims' resistance, resilience, and post-9/11 identity negotiation. Seeking to ""stand with youth under siege"" , the authors of this timely, insightful, and enjoyable book examine young Muslims' strategies and resilience in responding to the aftermath of 9/11. Addressing a mainly non-Muslim readership and skillfully coping with the dearth of empirical research on Muslim youth, the authors build on existing work on immigrants, youth identity, moral exclusion, and social justice. This book, readable and wide-ranging as it is, could have been strengthened by a higher level of familiarity with U.S. Muslims. In situating Muslim identities temporally, for example, 9/11 is overemphasized to the neglect of pre-9/11 events like the Iranian revolution, the Gulf War, and the rival growth of Islamism and Sufism in North America, to name a few. This text addresses academic readers in psychology, anthropology, sociology, education, cultural studies, and lay readers with an interest in Muslim Americans, the study of demographics, citizenship, and pluralism. The ""identity maps,"" pictures drawn by Muslim youth to represent their identities, which are scattered throughout the book, convey the thesis in a more immediate fashion. I would recommend it highly for undergraduate and beginning graduate students, and certainly for all readers interested in Muslim Americans, contemporary Islamic trends in the United States, and the post-9/11 political climate.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In this chapter, I review the conceptual and empirical challenges that we encounter when trying to understand (and nurture) resilience across different cultures and contexts. Definitional ambiguity and contextual influences muddy the conceptual waters; research design and measurement similarly confound efforts to investigate resilience empirically. To address both the conceptual and empirical problems culture introduces to the study of resilience, I offer a definition that accounts for both processes and outcomes associated with adaptation in culturally meaningful ways. I also review the literature that does exist for a construct that still finds its empirical footing mostly in the minority world. Based on what is available, I argue that there is both homogeneity and heterogeneity in outcomes and processes associated with resilience when cultural pluralism and contextual variation are introduced into how we both conceptualize and investigate stress and coping in resource-poor ecologies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: We examined whether structural elements of the school environment, in particular cultural pluralism and consistency and clarity of school rules and expectations of students, could mitigate the risk for mental health problems among young sexual minority adolescents. Methods: Data were collected in 2008 by means of a computer-based questionnaire completed at school by 513 young Dutch adolescents (12-15 years old) during regular class times. Eleven percent of these students, who were enrolled in 8 different schools, reported having at least some feelings of same-sex attraction. Results: Adolescents with same-sex attractions in schools where rules and expectations were experienced as less consistent and clear reported significantly more mental health problems than their peers with no same-sex attractions in the same schools. Such differences were absent in schools where rules and expectations were experienced as more consistent and clear. There were no such effects of cultural pluralism. Conclusions: Our results suggest that schools with consistent and clear rules and expectations mitigate the risk for mental health problems among students with same-sex attractions and underscore the importance of structural measures for the health of sexual minority youth.

Traumatic Amputation: A Case of Laotian Indignation and Injustice. Culture is an essential variable of diagnosis and treatment. A cultural perspective draws attention to the social context within which symptoms arise, are given meaning, and are managed. Ethno-cultural work on illness narratives suggests that most people can provide culturally-based explanations for their symptoms. While these explanations are inconsistent with biomedical theory, they relieve patient distress by allowing the patient to create meaning for symptoms. Exploring the characteristics, context, and antecedents of the symptoms enables the patient to convey them to the clinician who may have a divergent explanation of sickness. This case study uses the Outline for Cultural Formulation of the DSM-IV created for clinicians to elicit a narrative account of the illness experience from the patient. Our study examines how the patient, a Laotian used social indignation (""Khuam khum khang"") as an explanatory model for his ailment. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after having undergone a traumatic amputation. In the process of explaining his illness through a cultural idiom, the patient was able to reveal both personal and collective meaning of repressed anger and frustration, expressing them in a context that was acceptable to him. This cultural idiom allowed the patient to reflect upon the structure of the health care system and the specific context in which symptoms and their possible origins are recounted and explored. It also clarified to the treating clinicians some categories of experience and causal explanations that did not fit easily with western biomedical and psychiatric understanding. The case study illustrates how a cultural approach to illness from the patient's perspective offers a reflexive stance on the clinician-patient interaction that allows for better patient care. Key words. culture, meaning, cultural idiom, explanatory model, DSM-IV Outline for Cultural Formulation, social indignation, clinician-patient interaction Article 2. Impact of the Use the DSM-IV Outline for Cultural Formulation on the Dynamics of Multidisciplinary Case Conferences in Mental Health. The growth of cultural pluralism in North American society has required the mental health community to show a higher level of cultural sensitivity. Mental health professionals must not only be aware of the social and historical context of their clientele, but also of their profession. Clinical evaluations provide the information for clinical care. This information must be examined in a cultural-sensitive framework for assessment and case formulation that permits an accurate diagnosis across the cultural boundaries of both patient and mental-care professional. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) sets forth an Outline for Cultural Formulation (CF). It instructs clinicians not only on how to elicit culturally relevant clinical material, but also on how to assess the importance of the diverse cultural perspectives of patients and their families, thus increasing usefulness of their own cultural knowledge in treatment. This study is a conversational analysis of the nature and application of knowledge within a clinical, interdisciplinary context. It uses an expanded version of the CF as a framework, in which the discursive practices of mental health professionals are evolving. From a symbolic interactionist perspective, it examines the way different disciplines interpret and conceptualize cultural elements and the implications of this framework for interdisciplinary collaboration of assessment, treatment plan and care.

English women who met and married American servicemen during the postwar period of 1950s-1960s experienced understandable cultural and conceptual assimilation as G.I. brides. English immigration, however, provided its own set of arduous cultural challenges that have been generally disregarded due to cultural similarities and common language that would appear to promote a seamless absorption into U.S. culture. British post-war brides confronted unique immigrant experiences as ""silent immigrants"" (Strauss & Howe, 1991) arriving in America as impressionable young women. Transitions such as to cultural change, assimilation, emotional and psychological adjustment were issues faced by these women. There is a dearth of literature exploring how these women intellectually, culturally, and emotionally adapted to cultural change in America. Procedures. The initial phase of this qualitative multicase feminist study focused on survey responses from 23 women from 10 states belonging to the Transatlantic Brides and Parents Association (TBPA), a national organization for English people living in America. From this population five women were selected to share their individual experiences through semistructured interviews. Emergent data from codification of interview verbatim transcriptions and field notes produced a holistic portrait of their unique experiences and common factors that enhanced or inhibited cultural and conceptual assimilation. Findings. These women told unique stories of personal truths about early life in England, expectations of life in America, realization of those expectations, and the degree to which skills and educational experiences advanced the assimilation process. Friendship, TBPA membership, military life, church, and work were identified as factors contributing to successful assimilation. Although the five women presented different perspectives of the assimilation process, common themes of resilience and flexibility were central to their adjustment to a new way of life and acculturation. Conclusions. The women showed remarkable openness to new experiences in the assimilation process. They embraced citizenship, pursued further education, and were generally absorbed into the mainstream American population, although some reported ethnic pluralism continues to exist. Recommendations. Further research with existing 1,931 members of the TBPA organization should be conducted to corroborate findings of this study. A longitudinal study may show the extent to which cultural pluralism continues to exist in subsequent generations of British families.

Through concepts like cultural pluralism and the possibility of group rights, these discourses seemed to promise a renewed interest in addressing the injustices surrounding cultural difference. However, such efforts quickly mired in the vexed challenges that this posed for addressing racial injustice in the American context. By exploring the writings of its key interlocutors and the understandings of racial injustice they invoke, I argue that the concept of race served a key role in defining the boundaries and limits of cultural pluralism. Yet far from transcending the racially hegemonic and exclusionary roots of American liberal ideals of freedom and autonomy, this discourse increasingly redeployed the concept of race, particularly of racial identification, as a disavowed presence in the service of reconstituting an exclusionary American national identity. By tracing the constitutive role of race within these debates, I thereby examine the difficult challenges involved in addressing the racialized past of American political culture confronting any discourse, multicultural or otherwise, that would imagine a more promising future.

Of particular interest are themes of identity, memory, loss, cultural conflict, and assimilation. The first chapter addresses Cuaderno de Sarajevo (1993) and El sitio de los sitios (1995), two war narratives written by Juan Goytisolo during the siege of Sarajevo. Goytisolo, as a ""mudejar"" intellectual (a self-appointed heir of the three cultural traditions that coexisted in Medieval Spain) identifies arguments found in the medieval Spanish ""Romancero"" in the neo-Nazi discourses arising in globalized Europe. I suggest that Sarajevo is constructed in El sitio as the epitome of epistemological cooperation among cultures. I also explore Goytisolo's rich insights into value, reason, and cultural tradition, which together build an artistic vision in which moral universalism and cultural pluralism are complementary notions. The second chapter studies the Spanish author of Amazigh origin, Najat El Hachmi, who has published two novels in Catalan: Jo tambe soc catalana (2004) and L'ultim patriarca (2008). This chapter explores how her uniquely complex social location allows her-and challenges her-to claim her own literary memory. She does this by drawing on women writers from different literary traditions: on the Arab storyteller Sherezade; Catalan writers such as Merce Rodoreda and Victor Catala; and Chicana writers such as Sandra Cisneros. The third chapter explores filmic representations of Madrid and Barcelona. I suggest that Fernando Leon de Aranoa's Barrio (1998), Pedro Almodovar's Todo sobre mi madre (1999), Helena Taberna's Extranjeras (2002), and Basel Ramsis' El otro lado...un acercamiento a Lavapies (2002) participate in and/or capture some of the semiotic struggles related to the definition of urban and national identity that are being fought in symbolic spaces of both cities.

Because little is known about the interethnic attitudes and interactions between East Asian Americans and African Americans, a qualitative, descriptive method of study was utilized. Individual semi-structured interviews were administered to a convenience sample of East Asian-American undergraduates enrolled at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). Analysis was conducted in four steps: organization of the data; generating categories, themes, and patterns; testing the emergent hypotheses against the data; and searching for alternative explanations of the data. Results revealed that while there were some noticeable similarities in students' responses, many reported sharp differences in the domains discussed. In fact, a key theme that appeared in this study is the importance of group heterogeneity when considering intergroup relations. The results of this study provide qualitative support for the salience of ethnic identity as a social identity for East Asian Americans. As part of students' discussions of positive interactions and/or relations with African Americans, they identified favorable conditions that supported the positive outcomes. These favorable conditions are consistent with contact theory literature, and include equal status, mutual respect, constructive and meaningful context, and a voluntary and long lasting nature. Students reported observing a mixed state of relations between African Americans and East Asian Americans, describing absent, superficial, hostile, as well as positive relations between the two groups. Most stated they believed change in the nature of African American-East Asian American interethnic relations should occur, particularly in the form of unity and equality between the two ethnic minority groups, and with the onus of change placed on East Asian Americans. Respondents' interethnic attitudes and interactions were largely influenced by the messages disseminated by society and the media, but also uniquely determined by the attitudes and experiences of students' parents. A final key note gleaned from this study was participants' positive leanings toward cultural pluralism. Limitations of this study and future research directions are also discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In recent years, information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly web-based technologies, have created a more complex and challenging information technology (IT) environment for governments throughout the world. As more and more activities are migrating from physical to virtual media, users and employees have been faced with relentless pressure to use technology. This calls for a greater understanding of the human, social and cultural issues involved in the acceptance of IT systems by all stakeholders of the organisation. Indeed increasingly it has been acknowledged that one of the main determinants of IT success is organisational culture, and consequently the purpose of this research is to examine cultural barriers and enablers which have impeded or facilitated the implementation of E-Government initiatives in Malaysia. An anthropological framework based on the Grid and Group Cultural Theory of Mary Douglas is used to study this issue in more depth. This framework identifies four cultural cosmologies-hierarchism, egalitarianism, individualism and fatalism. We argue that cultural cosmologies can have both enabling and constraining characteristics and that cultural pluralism in the enabling forms of hierarchism, egalitarianism and individualism is essential for the successful implementation and operation of E-Government services. We illustrate these points through two case studies in Malaysia-one displaying constraining characteristics, which impeded IT implementation/use and the other displaying enabling characteristics, which facilitated IT implementation/use. Finally, a cross comparison of the two case studies on cultural issues is also provided.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book Linguistic minorities in democratic context by Colin H. Williams (2008). From the perspective of democratic theory and practice, the author presents an analysis of the participation of cultural minorities in European states. The sociopolitical context of each state and the minorities' relationships to their respective states are presented to make the argument that linguistic policy is part of public policy, and that the design and implementation of language policies needs to be cognizant of this context. The lack of correspondence between the formal political system and different cultural identities within it, as well as attempts to maintain linguistic diversity as opposed to linguistic standardization, provide a contradiction within which other grievances may be mobilized. Attention to data collection, language legislation, and management of language diversity is required for the formulation of public policies that reflect cultural pluralism and equality and that allow for democracy and freedom of action in a multicultural world order.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(create) Studying the immigration experience to Sweden diachronically shows that migration, as well as integration into the labor market, and participation in the political arena by newly arrived immigrants, have changed character over time. A majority of the immigrants arriving to Sweden in the first decades after World War II were labor migrants from mainly Nordic and other European countries. For the most part, they were driven by economic factors. On recommendation from the Labor Organization of Sweden (LO), a change in the admission legislation took place at the end of the 1960s, where a relatively liberal policy was replaced by a more restrictive one mainly toward non-Nordic labor migrants. Assimilation policy toward immigrants also changed, and since the middle of the 1970s the integration policy of Sweden is based on cultural pluralism and the slogans of equality, freedom of choice, and partnership. Integration into the labor market and political participation have been important goals of the policy. The settlement policy implemented since the middle of the 1980s, spreading refugees who gained a residence permit to a number of municipalities, and especially those with a favorable local labor market, can be seen as a way to attain these goals. Integration policies in Sweden have not been effective during the last decades. The ""multicultural"" society does exist in Sweden only if we look at the number of foreign born relative to native born. However, when it comes to the two prominent measures of integration, employment integration and voting participation, it becomes clear that large groups of immigrants are marginalized by the Swedish society.

Participants (N = 433) were adapted physical education specialists, physical education generalists, and teacher candidates. The research method was a descriptive cross-sectional survey (Fraenkel & Wallen, 1990). Data were collected using a modified version of the Pluralism and Diversity Attitude Assessment survey (Stanley, 1997). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences in attitude scores between teachers and teacher candidates. However, women's attitude scores were significantly higher than men's. Further Friedman's ANOVA test showed statistical differences on the survey's constructs for gender and professional status. Post hoc analysis indicated that the groups scored significantly higher on the construct, Value Cultural Pluralism than Implement Cultural Pluralism. This means teachers generally valued cultural diversity, but struggled to implement culturally responsive pedagogy. In conclusion, physical educators may need better preparation to ensure cultural competence.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Due to changes in state and federal policies, as well as logistical and fiscal limitations, researchers must increasingly rely on teachers' reports of school climate dimensions in order to investigate the developmental impact of these dimensions, and to evaluate efforts to enhance the impact of school environments on the development of young adolescents. Teachers' climate ratings exhibited a robust dimensional structure, high levels of internal consistency, and moderate levels of stability over 1-and 2-year time spans. Teachers' climate ratings were also found to be related consistently with students' ratings. In three large-scale samples of schools, teachers' climate ratings were associated significantly and consistently with students' performance on standardized tests of academic achievement, and with indexes of their academic, behavioral, and socio-emotional adjustment.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Under the naturalistic theory of morality I have defended (Wong, 2006), moralities are parts of cultures. In this essay I give a brief introduction to the motivations for the theory, explain the sense in which it is relativistic, and address some of the difficulties that confront any theory that explains moralities in terms of cultures. In particular, these difficulties concern the internal diversity and contestation within cultures, as well as the fuzziness and variability of boundaries between cultures. The first section introduces the naturalistic explanation of moralities in terms of cultures. The second section surveys the ways in which difficulties for the concept of culture have been raised in recent anthropological and philosophical literature. The third section proposes a concept of culture as conversation that takes these difficulties into account. The fourth section traces implications of the concept of culture as conversation for the question of how cultures differ from one another, and for the question of the moral identity of the individual as a participant in cultural conversations. The proposed concept of culture, it will be argued, helps to defuse the problem of fuzziness and variability of boundaries between cultures, helps us to reconcile the autonomy with the cultural embedding of moral identity, and calls into question traditional understandings of healthy and developed moral identity as possessing the properties of consistency, integration, and stability.

Edited Book",,"(from the introduction) The purpose of this edited volume is to provide a seedbed for the study of the moral self and the nature of moral identity, personality, and character. The impetus for this volume was the 2006 Notre Dame Symposium on Personality and Moral Character, which brought together renowned scholars from diverse perspectives to wrestle with how best to understand the moral dimensions of personality, and what this might require by way of theory and methodology. To our knowledge this was the first time that nationally visible scholars representing developmental, social, personality, and cognitive psychology were assembled to address theoretical and empirical questions regarding moral selfhood, personality, and identity. A second Notre Dame Symposium in 2008, held under the auspices of Notre Dame's College of Arts and Letters Henkels Lecture Series, resulted in more voices being added to the ongoing conversation. The aim of the two Notre Dame symposia, and now of this volume, is to carve out space for a new field of study on the moral self that is deeply integrative across the domains of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience. Heretofore, the fragmented research on moral personality has been mostly a study of cognition without desires, rationality without brains, agents without contexts, selves without culture, traits without persons, persons without attachments, dispositions without development. We hope the present volume starts to change all that. One will find here diverse points of view and genuine disagreement about the meaning of foundational constructs, to be sure, but we are confident that the volume points the way to promising integrative futures.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Cultural globalization and language education, by B. Kumaravadivelu. The book begins with a brief account of the author's own biculturalism. He uses this context to present three models of multiculturalism: the assimilationist model, the cultural pluralism model, and the hybrid model. Throughout the book, the author uses insights from a wide range of disciplines and perspectives, and a variety of languages, integrating his own experiences and those of others. In this way, the author models in his presentation of the topic what he hopes for in language education. The book integrates both theoretical and practical discussions of the nature of culture and language, and uses both to offer a new way of thinking about language teaching. In his discussion of cultural globalization and language teaching, the author does more than just criticize what is. He proposes what could be.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Lately, cultural diversity in Western societies has, in terms of religions, languages, ethnic we-groups, transnational ties, and countries of origin, once more undergone immense growth. Modes of migrant incorporation reflect endeavours to respond to this change. While some approaches such as assimilation and multiculturalism emphasize the social integration of migrants in the host societies, the vague term 'diversity' harbours innovative measures in two respects. First, diversity addresses not only the incorporation of migrants, but also how societies and particularly their organizations deal with cultural pluralism. Second, diversity can then be understood both as an individual competence of migrants as members of organizations and the civil sphere, and as a set of programmes which organizations adopt to address cultural pluralism. Also, novel forms of diversity have emerged, such as transnationality. Yet in the absence of a rights-based foundation the question arises of how social inequality can be dealt with.

It also considers how the new identity politics of South Korean cinema complicate our understanding of national cinema. The first chapter provides a historical context for the emergence of New Korean Cinema, focusing on the shared efforts between the government and the film industry to revive local cinema and the role of the generational shift in the film industry. The next two chapters analyze several films to illustrate the changing nationalism and hybridity of national culture and audience in New Korean Cinema. The last chapter focuses on the trasnationalization of South Korean cinema, with critical attention given to hybridity as an industrial strategy and as shaped by intra-regional co-productions. I make three major arguments about globalization and national cinema in the context of New Korean Cinema. First, the nation-state remains an important actor in the process of globalization; some nation-states have successfully resisted global forces, and become powerful players in the ever-changing world media cultural economy. Second, globalization as cultural hybridization not only occurs at multiple levels but is a more ambiguous and complex process than suggested by both cultural imperialism and cultural pluralism. Third, since the new media landscape is marked by the coexistence of hybridity, nationalism, and transnationalism, it is necessary to reconsider a text-based and essentialist understanding of national cinema.

The Kaufman needs assessment model was used as a foundation and a new type of survey needs assessment tool was developed and tested in a large northeastern urban school district using principals and vice principals within that district to determine the professional development needs and education priorities of those principals and vice principals. This research is a step toward creating and improving needs assessment tools for use in other school districts and settings. Improving on the needs assessment tools available prior to this research contributes to this area of scholarly writing and research and provides a new survey instrument and data analysis methods for other researchers to use not only in education settings but in other settings as well. A modified version of a Kaufman needs assessment is used to obtain information directly from participants regarding priority preferences for principal and leader professional development. From this needs assessment a list of professional development, skill enhancement, and education priorities is generated and given to the City School District (pseudonym) for its use in further developing a plan for providing professional development and funding the priority needs of education and skill enhancement for principals and leaders. The research findings are relevant to needs assessment researchers, practitioners, and most principal groups and schools in the United States because issues City School District faces-such as a high poverty level, broad racial and ethnic diversity, multiethnicity, cultural pluralism, overcrowding of buildings, working with inclusive education, working with special needs students, and low financial funding per student-are seen in many schools. Lastly, this research demonstrates that improvements can be made to the Kaufman model. A new tool now exists for instructional designers, researchers, professional development specialists, and trainers. This tool will assist with selecting, planning or ordering of professional development activities, and helps provide a way to determine proper funding priorities of these activities to have the greatest impact on professional development.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The mantle of 'culture expert' sits uneasily upon the hapless anthropologist's shoulders, however, for a variety of epistemological, moral, ethical, and professional reasons. This chapter-prompted by my own experience of playing such a role in asylum appeals-concerns the problems arising when culture is teleologized in courts of law, transformed from a conceptual tool of anthropological analysis into 'objective evidence', or asserted as the direct cause of persecution or delinquency. The issues are complex, and their treatment is necessarily partial. For example, there is no space here to examine the crucial differences in how lawyers and social scientists are trained to think and reason. The discussion starts by explaining the role of expert witnesses, and the kinds of evidence they can and cannot provide. It addresses the widespread use, especially in the United States, of the 'cultural defense' in cases involving immigrant or minority defendants. It summarizes anthropological approaches to the notion of culture; the ongoing debate between rights-based and culture-based approaches to international law; and the impact upon anthropology of current notions of legal and cultural pluralism. It concludes by briefly addressing the treatment of anthropological evidence in English courts, with special reference to asylum appeals.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Concerns over the erosion of a comprehensive public conception of morality are longstanding in political philosophy, but while some contemporary political philosophers see the relevant cause as being an increase in the acceptance of ethical relativism, others see this trend as the result of an increased intrusion of a market-based ethos into various social spheres that have traditionally been the province of non-market values. Thus while both accounts agree on the normative claim that there are certain values appropriate to particular areas of our lives, and on the descriptive claim that these values seem to be under threat, each postulate a different aetiology for the perceived phenomenon. This paper tentatively accepts the two claims over which both accounts agree, and examines the question over which they do not; the issue of causation, as well as looking at the feasibility and desirability of reversing the perceived progression. Taking into account cross-cultural longitudinal empirical studies of attitudinal change towards various socio-cultural issues, this paper postulates in qualified accordance with the first proposed aetiology, suggesting ethical and cultural pluralism to be prior to market forces, while accepting the probability that each play a significant role, and looks at the likelihood and advisability of change.

The religious and cultural pluralism, identity-fragmentation, and commodification of religious artifacts, images, and metaphors that typify postmodernity challenge models of religious education designed to socialize adults into coherent and stable religious identity. Postmodern Christian religious identify needs to be both deeply grounded in the practices of the Christian tradition and critically engaged with the plural cultures in which that tradition, as well as the lives of individual adult Christians, is embedded. Religious educators must develop innovative ways both to facilitate the personal transformation necessary as adults shift towards being more active agents in religious identify-construction, and to maximize the practical and theological support given to this complex developmental process by congregations. This dissertation presents concrete proposals for religious education in light of these challenges and opportunities. My work is grounded in the methodology of practical and cultural theology and combines insights from cognitive-developmental theory and transformative learning theory with constructive educational design. I propose strategies for adult religious education based on a Shared Christian Praxis approach, and augmented by several elements designed to be particularly responsive to the postmodern context. I investigate the effectiveness of these proposals from the standpoint of a field study of practices of Christian hospitality in a distinctively postmodern setting: a theologically progressive Episcopal congregation in a culturally diverse West Coast city. Data from the study indicate that my proposed strategies are effective, but limited by some of the very postmodern challenges they are designed to overcome. Developing the cognitive-developmental capacities necessary for transformative learning is a long and complex process. Adults particularly need help in learning how to reflect critically across theological and socio-cultural categories in the context of their fragmented lives. Effective postmodern religious education involves providing repeated, varied, and incremental opportunities for religious identity-formation over the long trajectory of adulthood, using every aspect of congregational life as an intentionally holistic formational setting.

Because of a decline in attendance, museum educators need to identify best practices to draw and retain audiences. I used 16 museology and history journals, books, and archives of museums prominent for using the method. I also interviewed 15 museum educators who employ experiential learning, one master interpreter of the National Park Service, and an independent museum exhibit developer. Experiential education involves doing with hands touching physical materials. Four minor questions concerned antecedents of experiential learning, reasons to invest in the method, the influence of social context, and cultural pluralism. Next is a review of the theorists whose works support experiential learning: Dewey, Piaget, Vygotsky, Lewin, Bruner, Eisner, Hein, and David Kolb plus master parks interpreter Freeman Tilden. The 8 characteristics they support include prior experiences, physical action, interaction with the environment, use of the senses, emotion, social relationships, and personal meaning. Other sections are manifestation of experiential learning, transformation of history museums, and cultural pluralism in history museums. The research design is descriptive, and the procedure, document analysis and structured interview. Findings are divided by decades after the first 120 years. Social context, examples of experiential learning, and multicultural activities are detailed. Then findings are discussed by patterns of delivery: sensory experiences, actions as diversion and performance, outreach of traveling trunks and of organized activity, crafts as handwork and as skills, role-playing, simulation, hands-on museum work, and minor patterns. The decline of involvement of citizens in the civic and cultural life of the community has adversely affected history museums. Experiential learning can stop this trend and transform museum work, as open-air museums and the National Park Service have demonstrated. In the future history museums may include technology, a more diverse audience, and adults in its experiential educational plans to thrive. Further research is needed on evaluation, finances, and small museums.

Caribbean family literature which focuses on the Afro-Caribbean family patterns does not satisfactorily address the issues of the Indo-Caribbean people, despite the recognition of cultural pluralism. This dissertation quantitatively examines whether the Indo-Guyanese differ from the dominant Afro-Caribbean culture of urban Guyana in three distinct familial domains. The ethnic differences in the structural arrangements of marriage, perception and values of marriage and family, and the nature of the conjugal unions were analyzed. Ethnic variations in each of these three familial domains were analyzed in order to establish if there is cultural continuity or assimilation among the Indo-Guyanese. Response data from Guyana from the year 1987 was used to test a number of specific research hypothesis in these familial domains using statistical techniques such as ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA and MANCOVA. Overall it was found from the analysis that the Indo-Guyanese differ from the Afro-Guyanese in the structural arrangements of marriage and the values of the marriage and family, but there were no major differences in the nature of the conjugal interaction. The structural and attitudinal differences suggests that the present day urban Indo-Guyanese have not fully assimilated into the dominant Creole culture, but have retained some of their cultural traits. Even when the effects of gender, age and education were controlled using multivariate analysis of variance, many of the ethnic differences were still evident. The Indo-Guyanese were found to have longer and more stable marriages were found to hold on to the more traditional values and beliefs of family life, which suggests that there is cultural continuity. The evidence that there is assimilation among the Indo-Guyanese include defining the family to be nuclear rather than joint or extended; romantic reasons for marriage were more popular than materialistic reasons; and egalitarian views of marital participation and satisfaction. Hence it appears that Guyanization is not just a political phenomena but a personal reality, and it is an ongoing process among the Indo-Guyanese.

One salient expression of this identity work is the heightened regulation of distinct gender and sexual roles for believers, which poses problems for feminist and gay Muslims. This research begins by asking: How are queer and feminist Muslims in America negotiating traditional religious beliefs with their gender and sexual identities and practices at the individual, congregational, and institutional level? Drawing upon fifty-five interviews, participant observation, and secondary data, I argue that some Muslim families and religious leaders in mosques and organizations use religious and cultural rhetoric to legitimate the need for modest dress, gender-segregated social interactions, relegating women to subordinate physical spaces and spiritual roles, and condemning homosexuality. The emphasis placed by family members and community leaders on the importance of the institution of heterosexual marriage, family honor, narrow definitions of masculinity and femininity, and heterosexism all contribute to the emotional distress, exclusion, and humiliation experienced by those who do not conform to prevailing social norms, which lead to the suppression of alternative sexualities. Thus, respondents confront multiple intersecting oppressions based on their religion, race, gender, and sexuality and, in many cases, lead refracted lives. Nevertheless, access to secular civil and human rights groups and discourse in the context of the religious and cultural pluralism of the U.S., a growing number of progressive American Muslim academics, and the Internet enable a few respondents to form collectives online, reconcile their gay and/or feminist identities with their faith, reject gender binaries, and transcend limitations on worship posed by gender. Intra-faith schisms and conflict are growing along with the growing diversity in gender and sexual ideologies and practices within Muslims communities. Furthermore, alliances between Muslims and other religious or secular groups along progressive/conservative lines may become more commonplace. More importantly, the religious leadership advances for women and the formation of queer Muslim identities and communities are reshaping understandings and practices of traditional Islam in unprecedented and unconventional ways.

We use the historiography of Foucault to exhume correspondences between political and popular representations of racial-national identity and of integration, following changes in the formation of ideas empowering racial liberalism. We place film interactively alongside Supreme Court rulings and Congressional debates around race integration, contemporaneously published works of history and sociology, and the ""memory"" of slavery and Reconstruction as displayed in the wider culture. In films centering a protagonist who is racially or culturally ""mixed,"" we examine a change in discourse surrounding racial integration. In the early fifties-from the social problem film such as No Way Out (1950) to the pro-Indian western such as Broken Arrow (1950) and Broken Lance (1954)-motion pictures employ a framework of the melting pot, or cultural assimilation, to represent integration. This signifies national support for racial progress yet also, by using terms of ""culture"" to repress terms of ""class,"" suggests widespread resistance to imagining and ensuring needed change in the racial-social structure of society. In the later fifties, a different logic-based on cultural pluralism-represents integration, often in films making miscegenation or racial mixing problematic. Movies such as The Searchers (1956) and Imitation of Life (1959) construct an imagined ""right"" to protect white status as a ""culture,"" or ""racial cultural"" boundaries that would oppose our political knowledge of race and class struggle. Further, we connect seminal liberal representations of race in the fifties to ideological positions today that efface the persistence of segregation-or that would represent poverty but do not advance a social remedy for it. This dissertation would challenge liberalism to speak not just for passive racial ""progress,"" for ""rationalism"" and for the individual, but moreover for the rights of the poor and working class to equal social resources, rights that interact with and would advance racial equality.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In this essay, Alain Locke's work is read as a search for an epideictic rhetoric. Locke, through his philosophy and editorial work, helps rethink the significance of epideictic rhetoric by articulating a pluralist notion of values and accounting for competition between value-systems. He suggested that race can and should be celebrated, and that acts of celebration should use aesthetic sensibilities capable of displaying the value of race. Showing the connections between Locke's philosophy and the rhetorical tradition illustrates the value and potential of a multi-cultural citizenry and the necessity of epideictic rhetoric in producing, maintaining, and negotiating relationships within such a community.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper explores moral reasoning within the framework of contemporary cultural theory, in which moral functioning is action mediated by tools (such as socially available discourses) within a social and cultural context. This cultural model of a dialogic moral self challenges many of the assumptions inherent in the individualistic Kantian position that underlies much moral reasoning research. It provides a model for understanding cultural variation in ethical systems as well as the social context in which individual reasoning operates and develops. This framework derives from the developmental psychology of Vygotsky and from discursive social psychology, drawing on Foucault and Bakhtin. The core processes are discursive: dialectical and dialogic relationships at the intersections of three parts of a system comprising societal-cultural context, dyadic interaction and the individual agent. Key processes include the cultural and social construction of moral narratives and discourses that provide explanations and justifications within shared legitimation, comprehension and value. These provide resources that are drawn upon both in dialogue and in individual reasoning. Interpersonal interaction, a crucible and also a scaffold for both individual reasoning and for social change, involves argumentation, rhetoric and positioning.

Sniderman and Louk Hagendoorn (see record 2007-05881-000). Sniderman and Hagendoorn systematically examine what happens to deeply held cultural, social, and political beliefs and practices when a nation confronts the presence of difference, for instance, Muslim presence. Their book When Ways of Life Collide: Multiculturalism and Its Discontents in the Netherlands has a basic premise. They suggest that the key concerns of multicultural efforts by any government are to promote a respect for cultural pluralism in the greater society. According to the authors, this premise also includes beliefs that minority groups have a right to respect for their unique cultural practices and beliefs, without close examination of the individual citizen's perception of him- or herself as part of the national character of a country. The authors also hold that the results of governmental policies and practices can have unintended effects on the social and political character of a nation.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The relation of morality to indigenous psychology (IP) is examined from four different yet complementary viewpoints. Basically, a western metaperspective is taken. First, the topic of morality is dealt with on a content level: If social scientists (as a first approximation) conceive of IP as a psychology that aims at understanding, explaining, and predicting people's behavior within specific cultures, then cultural rule systems, which are normative frameworks for individual behavior, can be understood as the core and the main differentia specified of such a psychology. Morality is one of these rule systems, both in the tradition of cultural relativism and cultural pluralism. The crucial question of whether or not morality is culture specific (indigenous) or universal is discussed. Second, the role of morality in the emergence of IPs is treated at the science of science level. Third, a slightly strange argument is developed based on the fact that particularly from an IP perspective, research on culture does not just serve an analytical function (answering the question ""What is culture?""), but treats culture as a characteristic of a group. It is postulated that this conceptualization of cultures as more or less homogeneous entities has moral implications. Finally, basic methodical implications are discussed, though they are also addressed in the previous sections.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper discusses and compares post-16 English Literature curricula in Australia and the UK, and the International Baccalaureate diploma, in the context of issues about breadth and depth in post-16 education, reflecting on the different structures and philosophies which have influenced approaches to teaching and learning at this level. It argues that, if A Level English students are to manage the transition to higher education effectively, and/or develop a broad, contemporary understanding of literature and literary studies, the post-16 literature curriculum in the United Kingdom needs to develop further in progressive directions informed by contemporary developments in higher education English, and by notions of critical literacy and cultural pluralism, as in the other systems described. It suggests that the effect of central government reforms in the United Kingdom, and the consequent weakening of professional networks at national and regional levels, as well as conflicts within the profession about the nature of literature teaching, are responsible for lack of progress in this regard.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Through the lens of the French law prohibiting Muslim headscarves in schools, this article examines the way in which societal tensions that arise in the context of religious and cultural pluralism are translated into legal discourses relating to human rights and equality. It explores the way in which the law is rooted in France's broader sociopolitical structure and history and contrasts it to the United Kingdom and Turkey. It proposes that the law is based on an anachronistic, formal interpretation of equality that is inappropriate for addressing the inevitable cultural diversity of modern French society, and through its permeation into law and policymaking more widely, it is a primary cause of the heightened social tensions involving the Muslim minority. An assessment of the legitimacy of a law that restricts minority groups' cultural practices in this way in any society should be based on a substantive interpretation of equality and should necessarily involve an active endeavor to understand the meanings of those cultural practices for those groups within their distinct context. Upon this foundation, law and policy can be developed in a way that better reconciles the pluralism of modern society with the common objectives of social harmony, stability, and tolerance.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(create) Although the change in the overall complexion of universities provides exciting educational, cultural, and social opportunities, there are significant concerns about facilitating positive adjustment of the culturally and linguistically different student, as well as the international student. If the acculturation process is not successfully negotiated and supported, there can be a significant impact on self-esteem and challenges to the transition to productive adulthood. Research targeting the culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) and the international student is limited, although a body of literature does exist that focuses on the meaning of college to students in general. Further, there is a limited amount of research focusing on second-language learning for the college student population and even less evidenced-based research clarifying the mental health needs of CLD, immigrant, and international students. The remainder of the chapter identifies the particular needs for the three identified groups, focusing on the campus environment as well as individual and interpersonal issues. Although less than 8% of colleges and universities employ school psychologists, the potential role of the school psychologist in program development, direct service, and consultation is addressed. Suggestions for prevention, early intervention, and treatment, as well as the importance of developing an environment of cultural pluralism and training individuals who are culturally competent, are addressed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The reform of the United States Immigration Act in 1965 transformed what Robert Bellah identified as ""American civil religion"" and one of its central components: America's unique religious pluralism. At mid-century, Will Herberg showed how religion functions in the creation of American identity through what we call here ""passive pluralism."" This passive pluralism allowed the mainline religions of America to claim a presence within the nation. But the new immigration patterns have created what the author calls here ""active pluralism,"" which lays assertive claim to the meanings of public time and space. This argument is explored through the construction of an Orthodox Jewish ritual space or eruv in Los Angeles.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Predictions derived from models of cultural pluralism and cultural assimilation were tested. Previous research has shown that highlighting differences between ethnic groups, in conjunction with self-focus, can reduce prejudice. The presented research tested the following questions: (a) does highlighting differences function to reduce prejudice between groups that are dissimilar to each other as well as between those that are highly similar, (b) is prejudice reduction due to distinctiveness a function of the lessened ingroup positivity or lessened outgroup negativity, (c) does making distinctiveness salient reduce prejudice toward only the distinctive outgroups or to outgroups more generically, and (d) does the manipulation equally impact African American, Mexican American, Mexican National, and White American participants? Results demonstrated that highlighting differences while simultaneously focusing on the self reduces prejudice, although similarity mediates the relationship with those who are perceived as more different. Distinctiveness also reduced outgroup negativity and generalized to other outgroups. Finally, the manipulation reduced prejudice only for White Americans, Mexican Americans, and Mexican Nationals.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: This paper signals departure from a theoretical perspective on organizational culture in mergers and acquisitions based on a binary opposition between coherence and pluralism. The paper aims to outline another, dialogic perspective on cultural transformations in mergers and acquisitions, based on an assumption that individuals occupy temporary positions in dynamic dialogue, negotiating equally transitory, but temporarily cohesive allegiances. Design/methodology/approach: The dialogic perspective derives from a constructionist approach and involves ethnographic research methodology. It is developed to track the complex contests of interests in post-merger pluralist cultures and to reconstruct their dynamics. While some events in the merger process contribute to cultural pluralism and contest of interest, others appear to render allegiance to cohesive cultural elements seductively appropriable. Findings: Two situations are presented. The first poses a view of culture during mergers in which contest over meaning is central and whereby the representation of a cohesive organizational culture is appropriated for political purposes. The second situation illustrates cross-cutting cultures in action, presenting the development of a ""working culture"" a notion based on flitting cross-organizational allegiances in the interest of confronting a central team. Originality/value: The paper contributes to critical work on organizational culture in merger integration. It points to the inseparability of binaries, the limits of cultural attribution and the tension instigated by the conflation of culture's ""differences"". In closing, it points to a future direction with a relational emphasis to merger integration.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Australian community psychology (CP) has a shared history as well as regional variations, resulting in an eclectic mix of ideas, methodologies, and practices. In this chapter, we review the emergence of CP in Australia from within the dominant paradigm to its official recognition as a subdiscipline of psychology and the development of postgraduate programs. CP's formal history in Australia has links with the parallel, recent history of the subdiscipline elsewhere, particularly in the United States; informally, the climate in which it was born was distinctly Australian, resonating with the cultural pluralism and emergent debates around decolonisation and political realignment within the Asia-Pacific region that characterised the 1970s in this country. In this chapter, we critically examine a number of aspects of that history: the impact of the decision to locate the subdiscipline as a professional specialisation; the role of community psychologists in consciousness-raising around social justice within psychology and society; and the importance of geography in determining the nature of CP theorising and applications in this part of the world. We draw on the responses from a survey of 25 CP academics, practitioners, and students in order to personalise the emergence and subsequent development of CP in Australia.

Anti-Bias Multicultural Education With Young Children and Families by Louise Derman-Sparks and Patricia G. Ramsey (see record 2006-08655-000). By purporting to augment cultural pluralism with critical thinking, antibias/multicultural (AB/MC) education elucidates this paradigm shift from appreciating diversity to working toward social justice. At the heart of AB/MC education is the desire to open new dialogues that increase the probability that children will grow up to challenge and resist racism. This book uses an eye-catching title to directly address issues of racial concern among children; the book does so in a manner that is accessible, making it possible for educators to understand and, more important, to implement the otherwise difficult subject matter of stopping the cycle of hegemonic racism passed down to our children. Derman-Sparks and Ramsey provide a well-articulated account of the necessity of AB/MC for European Americans, but they also detail a comprehensive framework for putting AB/MC concepts into action. As contemporary racism can be conceptualized as less of a desire to harm and more of a reluctance to help or merely a desire to maintain the status quo, their professed social action is evident in practice. This book details how to explore stereotypes with children, how to work with parental resistance, how to facilitate children's reaction to unfair situations, and how to use children's biased remarks as teachable moments. The format of the book allows for a comprehensive attempt to present a myriad of possible strategies to promote inclusiveness across racial, gender, and socioeconomic differences.

The purpose of this study was to examine the structural dimensions of two scales developed to measure a worldminded attitude. Furthermore, the possibility of a higher order factor structure was explored, and higher order dimensions were related to three empirically and/or theoretically related constructs. Participants in this study included 314 undergraduate students at a mid-Western university. Each participant completed the Worldmindedness Scale, the Global-Mindedness Scale, the Pluralism and Diversity Attitude Assessment, the Social Distance Scale, the Social Dominance Orientation Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression techniques were used to explore the research questions posited in the study. Findings and conclusions. Both the Worldmindedness Scale and the Global-Mindedness Scale demonstrated evidence of a multidimensional factor structure, each comprising five factors. A higher order factor model was supported from the interfactor correlations across the scales. This higher order model was presented and discussed. Cultural Pluralism, Social Distance, and Social Dominance Orientation were all found to be significantly related to structural dimensions of the scales in question. The demonstration of a positive relationship between nationalism and internationalism was found.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article addresses issues related to international adoption, with China as an illustrative case. It describes the context of international adoption and how China has come to be a leading source of transnational adoption especially for the West. Policy, theory, and research related to transnational and transracial adoption are examined in relation to Chinese adoptees and their adoptive families. Based on the theoretical and research literature as well as clinical experience, a framework for psychoeducation is presented together with resources that can serve adoptive families and professionals who work with mental health, child development, and family issues related to adoption. Further implications for counseling training and practice as well as systemic issues of policy, social justice, and cultural pluralism are discussed.

Authored Book",,"(from the jacket) George Kateb is one of the most respected and influential political theorists of the past quarter century. His work stands apart from that of many of his contemporaries and resists easy summary. In these essays, Kateb often admonishes himself, in Socratic fashion, to keep political argument as far as possible negative: to assert what we are not, and what we will not do, and to build modestly from there some account of what we are and what we ought to do. Drawing attention to the nonrational character of many motives that drive people to construct and maintain a political order, he urges greater vigilance in political life and cautions against ""mistakes"" such as patriotism, which too often results in terrible brutality and injustices. He asks us to consider how commitments to ideals of religion, nation, race, ethnicity, manliness, and courage wind up in the service of immoral ends, and he exhorts us to remember the dignity of the individual. The book is divided into three sections. In the first, Kateb discusses the expansion of state power (including topics such as surveillance) and the justifications for war recently put forward by American policy makers. The second section offers essays in moral psychology, and the third presents fresh interpretations of major thinkers in the tradition of political thought, from Socrates to Arendt.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: To develop a more thorough understanding of culture in a rapidly changing global environment. Design/methodology/approach: The recent literature dealing with ways in which cultural dynamics are influencing the nature and meaning of culture are examined. Different perspectives of culture related to three key components of culture, intangibles, material culture and communication, are explored. Based on this, directions for research on the content of culture are discussed as well as how it should be approached. Findings: Culture is becoming increasingly deterritorialized and penetrated by elements from other cultures. This is resulting in cultural contamination, cultural pluralism and hybridization. It has become more difficult to study culture as it is becoming diffuse. At the same time, it is becoming more important to study it because of its pervasive influence on consumer behavior. Research limitations/implications: Given that culture is no longer a phenomenon defined by and isolated to a particular locale, research on culture must carefully specify the role of culture, define the appropriate unit of analysis, isolate confounding influences and expand the range of contexts. Originality/value: The parallel trends of globalization and multiculturalism make it increasingly important to develop a deeper understanding of culture and its various manifestations. For progress to be made, research designs must account for this complexity and span multiple contexts to establish the generality of findings. This will result in improved knowledge of culture and its role in molding consumption behavior.

This paper describes the evolution and unique educational approaches of the Department of Arts and Consciousness at John F. Kennedy University in California - a studio art program that uses innovative holistic techniques to lead students into the integration of body, mind, spirit and culture, through art. The program stresses cross-cultural awareness, community service and spiritual awareness. The historical and cultural foundations for the re-emergence of art as a non-religious, spiritual, and self-integrative practice are examined. These foundations include ideas associated with the Bauhaus, Asian art and the Automatist branch of the Surrealist movement. The department's educational philosophies and curriculum are discussed within the context of overlooked spiritual legacies of modernism, cultural pluralism, and the changing roles of art as professional practice.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Review three books ""The Psychology of Cultural Experience,"" edited by Carmella C. Moore and Holly F. Mathhews (2001), ""A History of Ancient Psychiatry,"" by Giuseppe Roccatagliata (1986) and ""Pathologies of the West,"" by Roland Littlewood (2002). The first book, The Psychiatry of Cultural Experience, provides an anchoring platform for a cultural psychiatry. It lays the theoretical basis for a cultural psychology and it might consist of. It does so by illustrating the pervasive and insinuating way in which culture burrows into the mind and shapes what an individual feels, believes, orients to group mates, and how he or she acts out his or position in a society. While not addressing basic parameters of psychiatric conditions, chapters nonetheless strongly suggest that character is likely to be shaped and molded by culture. This book provides one with material with which one can make inferences about how psychiatric conditions are likely to be constructed psychologically and socially. The second book, A History of Ancient Psychiatry, reviews in a broad sweep the ideas and formulations the about human phenomena we now construe as mental illness or psychiatric disorder during the formative period of European history. While predominantly conceptual, theoretical, and historical, it provides nonetheless an opening for one to propose how ""real persons"" burdened by emotional and social problems were thought about and dealt with by the literate elite or experts. Furthermore, insofar as the latter produced knowledge out of clinical encounters, engaged their clients (or patients, apprentices) in dialogues, and the knowledge they produced percolated through (perhaps restricted) segments of the population, this book provides a view of how persons burdened by psychiatric-related conditions behaved and made sense of their predicament, and also how indigenous psychiatry was conceptually organized during antiquity and handled through forms of healing. The diversity of views, the cultural pluralism inherent in the configuration of psychiatric conditions and indigenous psychiatry, is analyzed and categorized. The third book, Pathologies of the West, brings one to the present and illustrates the maturity that the field of interest--cultural psychiatry--has attained. It discusses in detail ""real"" syndromes, describing not only how culture configures them as symbolic entities, expressive entities, but also as social and historical realities. The influence of psychiatry as an intellectual as well as medical institution in modern society is made abundantly clear by a creative examination of culture and modern social and intellectual history.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In a psychoanalytic interpretation, the article explores the strand of thinking stimulated by the events of September 11th and how racism and religious prejudice are seen as an obstacle. Today we live in a global village, and the twin towers may have been a most potent symbol of humankind's progress in sharing a basic humanity in a way that supports each to grow and develop in their own way. However, this description is of life in the metropolitan West, where progress towards cultural pluralism has gone remarkably smoothly. Cities today are increasingly multi-cultural and tolerant, and sometimes proud of it. The author wonders have the privileged few, in global terms, achieved this by projecting the uncertainties and anxieties connected with ordinary human frailty into excluded groups around the world, whose lives then become less precious than our own.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The article offers a socio-historical analysis of the evolution of Quebec school system since the 1960s. It puts forward that during the socio-ideological debates which began after World War II, the Parent report (1963-1965) has lead to the abandonment of the educational model based on the example of France and centred on classical humanities, but also driven by neothomist approaches. Through several changes of curricula and due to social and economic evolution, this educational model was progressively replaced by a more pragmatic one, focused on the adaptation to the economic and utilitarianist expectations of the neoliberal system. This transformation was supported by leading ideological views which evolved from humanities-based humanism to a renewed type of humanism: pluralist humanism - which was presented as being transhistorical since it maintained the continuity between both models - then to a humanist pedagogy and, finally, to cultural pluralism.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Media,"Reviews the video, One Nation Many Voices by E. Ornstein and H. Moses (2004). This 56-minute video with accompanying guidebook, tells the story of the Brown County Diversity Resolution or the ""English Only Law."" The video makes the point that for many ethnic communities, there is a danger that their cultural heritage will be lost if fewer and fewer members of the next generation speak the language. The current trend is toward cultural pluralism where individuals can embrace certain American customs while maintaining a strong sense of their ethnic and cultural identity. The video illustrates this trend by highlighting a school program in Brown County, where Anglo and Latino students are learning Spanish and English simultaneously and where on alternating days one language is dominant. The video and guidebook are useful for school social workers, teachers, and administrators. The video also addresses the complex issues around loss of language, identity, and cultural connections. The video's narrative focus reflects a postmodern sensibility, which emphasizes the cultural context and the uniqueness of each individual's ethnic heritage. Overall, we found this to be a provocative and interesting video that encouraged us to examine our own biases and feelings about issues such as the immigrant experience, cultural pluralism, language, and bilingual education.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, ""Worship and Wilderness: Culture, Religion, and Law in Public Lands Management,"" by Lloyd Burton. While the author's account distances itself from the conventional, these are all indices of the degree to which this work is over-determined by a desire fully formed within a dominant national imaginary. In a sense, this book makes no bones about this insofar as the historical and other chapters that frame the contemporary case studies to which nearly half of this work is devoted are cast in terms of the First Amendment, the ""trust doctrine"" in U.S. Indian law, religious and cultural pluralism, and multiculturalism. It is, I suggest, such a formulation of the problematic at stake in the geography the author takes up, and the attendant Americanist ideology of the separate spheres occupied by religion and law, that predict the author's desire to locate nonnative religious-cultural claims alongside their native corollary and discover ""coevolution"" in these terms. If these American discourses are anything but irrelevant, as his cases and the works hovering in their margin suggest, they form but one discursive layer necessary to critically mapping the mutually constituted geography he has called up. As to this map's configuration, these scenes from the margin bring home law's simultaneities as a colonial-postcolonial site of encounter as the key to framing the more-than-raced histories of difference and democracy in indigenous America/America and beyond.

Faculty members were assessed during a weekly staff meeting to determine levels of cultural awareness on the Teacher Multi-Cultural Attitude Survey (TMAS; Ponterotto, Baluch, Greig, & Rivera, 1998), the Oklahoma Racial Attitude Scale (GRAS; LaFleur, Leach, & Rowe, 2002, in press), and demographic questionnaires. Data from 99 staff members at three schools were analyzed. Demographics revealed 86% of teachers as White and female, and approximately 50% had received no or minimal diversity training. The TMAS was used to determine the degree to which teachers perceived themselves as aware and comfortable with issues of cultural pluralism. Self reported cultural awareness was significantly lower than expected. The construct of WRC as used in this study consists of characteristic attitudes people have regarding the significance of being White and what that implies to those who do not share White group membership (Rowe, Bennett, & Atkinson, 1994). The majority of respondents identified as having Achieved White racial consciousness attitudes, although 23% of the scores were disregarded. Significant correlations, were found between WRC Integrative/Dominative and Reactive subscales and cultural awareness. WRC Conflictive scores negatively correlated with cultural awareness scores. Significantly higher cultural awareness scores were found when teachers had prior extensive diversity training as compared to teachers who had no training. This study revealed a significant correlation between Child Study team academic referrals and Integrative/Dominative scores. Other significant correlations between referrals and cultural awareness or WRC cluster scores were not found. Results are discussed and future areas of research are suggested.

This lucid, engaging, splendidly written book discusses issues of the utmost social and scientific relevance with passion and courage. Defending a pluralist conception of culture, presenting moral worlds encountered in field studies, and rejecting tacit or explicit beliefs of Western superiority are the main aims of Shweder's discourse. Against those moral activists who seem to possess too firm a sense of what is objectively and universally right or wrong. Shweder claims that different cultures should be considered equal in dignity. Shweder's defense of cultural pluralism is illuminating and courageous but seems to rely on an idea of culture as too fixed and self-contained to acknowledge the positive role that agency and moral activists can play in promoting change across different moral worlds.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"It is a fundamental ideal of liberal democracy that all citizens should enjoy fully equal citizenship. Yet many minorities are still routinely ignored, excluded, patronized, and not regarded as full members of the political community. This denial of equal standing undermines their equal citizenship. Liberalism and Cultural Pluralism each advocate strategies to improve this situation. Their arguments build upon expectations about how citizens should, can, and do understand membership in the political community. Our survey and focus group data from six matched communities in the United States and Great Britain show how citizens' understandings of membership in the political community incorporate communitarian attitudes that impede the liberal and cultural pluralist projects.

Attitudes were found to have a unidimensional structure, but the level of support for multiculturalism was found to vary significantly over societal domains. Level of education and living in city districts with few non-natives were the only background variables that were (positively) related to support for multiculturalism. A path model, with psychological background variables (knowledge, life satisfaction, life opportunities, perceived social norms about multiculturalism as a threat and support for multiculturalism, and social desirability) predicting attitudes and behavior, showed a good fit. Generally, exclusionist positions were not endorsed by majority Dutch, but cultural pluralism was not seen as a valuable asset of their society, and they are not inclined to put much effort into minority integration.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"After the democratic transition to post-Communist Poland, ultraconservative groups found themselves legitimately able to propagate a nationalist ideology. They focused on an idea of 'national identity' that clearly and restrictively defined the boundaries of the national community. In the late 1990s a far-right movement supported by a radical faction of the Roman Catholic Church gained wide public support and, eventually, political legitimization. The fears of those for whom the transition of the socio-economic system did not bring a change for the better have been exploited by activists and institutions that consistently point to various foreign 'threats' (external and internal) against Poland's political and economic independence and against national integrity. Starnawski analyses forms of anti-pluralist backlash as strategies undertaken by the ultra-conservative media. Provided is a case study of Nasz Dziennik, one of the major Polish newspapers to disseminate a far-right discourse that combines a concept of 'national identity' with radical Catholicism. Such nationalist-oriented media use rhetoric that claims to be representative of the dominant group, and attempt to provide the audience with a restrictive sense of identity that is based on the construction of elements that are considered foreign and threatening to a sense of nationhood, a mobilization of the audience against foreign 'threats', and the exclusion or marginalization of elements depicted as incongruous with collective identity, especially the cultures of national and ethnic minorities (both 'native' minorities and recent immigrants), minority religions and alternative cultures, as well as liberal advocates of diversity. Since Polish society is in large part culturally homogeneous, its members are more often exposed to stereotyped images of minority groups than they are to face-to-face contact with members of minorities. Therefore, Starnawski argues, exploring the contemporary nationalist discourse in 'pluralizing' societies such as Poland is no less essential for the diagnosis of anti-democratic obstacles than studying the actual conditions of minority groups themselves. The future of social and cultural pluralism in Poland heavily depends on the majority's awareness of diversity and its ability to promote attitudes of openness to and understanding of cultural differences on the one hand, and a readiness to extend the notion of 'Polishness' to a wide range of cultural and social categories on the other.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The structure of perceived school climate and the relationship of climate dimensions to adaptation were examined in a large-scale multi-year investigation of students who attend middle-grade-level schools. Analyses of the structure, reliability, interrater convergence, and stability of school climate ratings were conducted in a large-scale sample of over 105,000 students in 188 schools. The climate scales exhibited a stable dimensional structure, high levels of internal consistency, and moderate levels of stability over 1- and 2-year time intervals. The relationship between climate ratings and students' adjustment was examined in 3 increasingly large samples of schools and students that were collected during successive years of this project. Ratings of multiple climate dimensions were associated consistently with indexes of academic, behavioral, and socioemotional adjustment.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Hypotheses drawn from Taifel and Turner's (1986) Social Identity Theory and a hypothesized ""need for distinctiveness"" predict that attention to how two groups differ, as opposed to how they are similar, should reduce prejudice. Previous research, however, indicates that a self-awareness manipulation is needed for prejudice reduction to occur (Zarate et al, 2000). It is possible, however, that the previous self-awareness manipulations acted as self-affirmation procedures, which may complicate any interpretations. Research by Fein and Spencer (1997) based on Self-Affirmation Theory show that self-affirmation procedures enhance self-concept, which acts to reduce expressed prejudice. The present studies test hypotheses concerning a need for distinctiveness and the role of the self in prejudice reduction. 236 participants were asked to focus on between-group similarities or between-group differences, after which participants performed a self-affirmation task (Experiment 1) or a negative self-awareness task (Experiment 2). Results demonstrate that attention to group differences, in conjunction with a self-awareness manipulation, reduces prejudice. The findings are discussed for the relevance to various theories of prejudice and for models of cultural pluralism.

This dialogue took place around some of the basic premises of multicultural psychology. Those basic premises are identified here as a culturally pluralistic philosophy, a psychosocial and sociopolitical perspective on development and treatment, and a community and systems intervention strategy in addition to individual intervention strategies. The history and theoretical bases of these premises are described and posited as an organizing metastructure for education, training, and practice of professional psychology.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examines how different views of American nationalism, ideas about cultural, racial, and religious pluralism, and policies and practices about civie education have interacted in the US from 1900 to the early 1950s. Definitions of American identity changed dramatically between 1900 and 1950, challenged by millions of immigrants who came to the US early in the century. Responding to this challenge, assimilationists demanded that immigrants shed their ethnic identities entirely, while cultural pluralists emphasized maintaining ethnic roots. Although public schools created programs to ""Americanize"" immigrant children, that goal was realized in an ironic way as children blended their American and ethnic identities. During the Great Depression and World War II, civic education played a role in this process by encouraging students to redefine American identity as a commitment to broad civic ideals, including respect for diversity rather than strict assimilation of Anglo-American Protestant norms.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article compares the efforts of movement activists in three dissimilar groups to replace a stigmatized status with a valued one by portraying their groups as resembling established minorities (claims of ""contiguity"" in ""cultural space"") and as differing from groups stigmatized as deviant (claims of ""distance""). The most common claims assert similarity to African Americans, and frequently incorporate civil rights themes (exemplifying frame diffusion). Tactically, these minority status claims exploit both the resonance of cultural pluralism and state recognition of minorities. Strategically, minority status framing enables stigmatized groups to claim legitimacy without changing -- simultaneously asserting both normality and difference.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The growing cultural pluralism of US society requires clinicians to examine the impact of cultural factors on psychiatric illness, including on symptom presentation and help-seeking behavior. In order to render an accurate diagnosis across cultural boundaries and formulate treatment plans acceptable to the patient, clinicians need a systematic method for eliciting and evaluating cultural information in the clinical encounter. This article describes one such method, the Cultural Formulation model, expanding on the guidelines published in DSM-IV. It consists of five components, assessing cultural identity, cultural explanations of the illness, cultural factors related to the psychosocial environment and levels of functioning, cultural elements of the clinician-patient relationship, and the overall impact of culture on diagnosis and care. The authors present a brief historical overview of the model and use a case scenario to illustrate each of its components and the substantial effect on illness course and treatment outcome of implementing the model in clinical practice.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This research situates attitudes toward cultural pluralism between 2 bodies of research on socio-political conflicts with a symbolic emphasis: one addressing the culture wars and the other addressing contemporary racial attitudes. Analysis uses data from the 1994 General Social Survey (GSS) ""multicultural module"" to test a range of discrete claims emerging from each perspective in several thematic areas: attitudinal distribution/polarization, patterns of support/opposition and issue salience, political alignment and crystallization, and the attitudinal gap between principles and policy implementation. A recurring pattern in the data is the association of central theoretical variables with attitudinal extremity rather than (or in addition to) an association with support for or opposition to pluralism. Discussion links that pattern to the symbolic character of conflicts over pluralism and suggests how it impacts both the understanding of cultural pluralism and of symbolic conflicts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper addresses those and other issues in an examination of the ""new racist"" (NR) rhetoric of contemporary White separatists (WSs) who focus on legitimating their movement using a cultural pluralist master-frame. In the context of theories about social movements, affect, and the social construction of ethnicity, I describe how NRWSs engage in frame-transformation and frame-alignment by (a) consciously packaging a hate-free racism, (b) developing strategies of equivalence and reversal-presenting whites as equivalent to ethnic and racial minorities, and (c) deploying ideas about love, pride, and heritage-preservation to evidence both their putative lack of animosity toward others as well as their ethnic credentials. I interpret these ethnic affectations as contextually bound efforts at truth construction that offer an opportunity to explore the role of affect in social movements. I conclude that the product of these claims is Kultural Pluralism: a blurring of distinctions between cultural pluralism and White supremacist racism, designed to emotionally appeal broadly to moderate and mainstream conservative Whites.

This book, written before the 1987 General Election, is about the way business influences government in Britain with an additional chapter about business representation in the EEC. The book's thesis is that business is not well organized collectively, nor is government well placed to deal with business and therefore the government acts in ways which are contrary to the interests of business. The framework within which the analysis is conducted is essentially a pluralist one where the categories 'government' and 'business' are distinct and are the main units of analysis and the method is an empiricist account of how institutions operate. The discussion on methodology, which includes pluralism, corporatism and 'privileged interest' as alternative approaches, concludes that they in fact converge. The book is a useful descriptive account of the institutional links between various parts of business and government.

The initial instrument consisted of 60 questions and was completed by 215 preservice teachers in physical education who were enrolled in the final 2 years of their program at 11 selected universities. Factor-analytic procedures produced a conceptually meaningful four-factor solution with internal consistency reliabilities in the range of .72 to .85 for the four factors. The final instrument, the Pluralism and Diversity Attitude Assessment (PADAA), consists of 19 statements. The PADAA measures the degree to which a respondent possesses positive attitudes toward cultural pluralism and whether an individual is comfortable or uncomfortable with diversity. The 4 scales are Appreciate Cultural Pluralism, Value Cultural Pluralism, Implement Cultural Pluralism, and Uncomfortable with Cultural Diversity.

Reviews the book ""Cultural Divides: Understanding and Overcoming Group Conflict"" edited by Deborah A. Prentice and Dale T. Miller (see record 1999-02753-000). Starting in 1992 a group of social psychologists, invited by the Russell Sage Foundation, discussed the implications of contemporary psychological research on culture and identity for predicting, understanding, and improving intergroup relations. The group met for six years, and this book is the fruit of these efforts. The distinguished social psychologists contributing examined four perspectives: (a) the ethnic hierarchy model, in which a dominant group claims rights and privileges not to be shared with other subordinate groups; (b) the one-way assimilation model, which requires minorities to abandon their culture and fully adopt the dominant culture; (c) the cultural pluralism model, according to which ethnic groups can maintain their distinct cultures, while adhering to a set of rules and understandings that enable them to live with other groups; and (d) the separatism model, in which culturally distinct groups withdraw from mainstream society and form autonomous, self-governing communities. This volume is particularistic: It presents very little work that purports to be universal and much that is based on cultural differences. There are many more sins of omission than of commission. Overall, this book is well worth the price.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Discusses the role of and definitions of religious experience within the study of religion. It is argued that scholarship that does not attend to the experiential dimension of religious practice is dismissed by many as reductionistic, and further, that the academic literature also does not clearly delineate between religious experience and mystical experience. The reluctance and inability of scholars to clearly stipulate the meaning of these terms is discussed in light of challenges of empiricism and cultural pluralism. Also, the ideological aspect of the appeal to experience is highlighted especially in regard to mystical experience. The role of mystical experience in Western vs Asian religious streams is explored, and evidence is examined regarding the supposition that Asian religions are more experientially rooted than their Western counterparts. It is concluded that it may be ill conceived to construe the object of religious study to be the inner experience of religious practitioners. Implications of the ""humanistic"" drive to empower experience are addressed in light of the need for objective reality and for critical scholarship.

The document stipulates educational provision for Namibian learners who belong to multilingual, ethnolinguistic and socio-economic groups. Since this provision results from an interaction between central government's espoused values and their perceptions of political and economic needs; the policy decision was arguably based on a reactive rather than a proactive approach to those needs. The emergence of English as the sole official language in a country of 1.6 million inhabitants, with only 0.8% speaking English natively, was therefore not planned. The study argues that first, the policy is formulated vaguely, secondly, it is a contradiction in terms with respect to cultural pluralism on the one hand, and assimilation on the other; and thirdly, that there is an apparent neglect of the learners first languages. It characterizes and discusses the nature of language-education planning, suggesting criteria considered significantly relevant in making a research-based choice using conceptual tools appropriate for language-education planning. The study further investigates the cost-effectiveness of the language policy to assess its potential success by describing and analyzing colonial language practices and the present policy in order to determine its relevancy to the needs of primary education. An alternative 3-language-formula policy plan is suggested that permits universality in primary education by promoting the use indigenous languages as media of instruction, and the incorporation of other languages as subjects, one that gives co-official status to at least one of the indigenous languages of multilingual Namibia, alongside English.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter evaluates developmentalism as an ideology by presenting a series of critiques from distinct frames of reference: conservatism, neo=Marxism, cultural pluralism, feminism, and postmodernism. All 5 critiques detail the issues of developmentalism from their perspectives. They suggest, sometimes in different and incompatible ways, that developmentalism is a form of restraint. Neoconservatives see it as interfering with parents' and schools' freedom to bend children's characters from evil to virtue. Neo=Marxists see developmentalism as the ideological support for labor discipline that constrains workers' emancipatory desires. Developmentalism is presented as imposing artificial hierarchies of value on cultural patterns by pluralists. And feminists point to the demeaning nature of developmentalism that diminishes their opportunities for self=worth. Finally, postmodernism presents developmentalism as a technology of power whereby developmental discourse and practice control processes of formation of self. Developmentalism appears to be a limiting force. These differences in critique serve to affirm the social construction of developmentalism.

They report on the Intergroup Relations, Conflict, and Community Program, a circular and living-learning program aimed at helping students understand the relationship between groups and democracy. The program incorporates elements of many psychological approaches to improving intergroup relations but also focuses more heavily than most approaches on difference and on making group boundaries salient. The chapter examines the impact of this program on intergroup perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. It also examines the role of preexisting power differentials, hypothesizing that group identity is threatening for members of dominant but not of subordinate groups. The research reported here attests to the importance of both of these factors, serving as an experiment in cultural pluralism.

The authors also provide a history of a segregated society and schooling, touching on the Anglo-Protestant roots of segregated schooling, schooling for the American Dream, and the 20th-century crisis of identity. The authors then discuss common schooling and segregation at the end of the millennium. This topic includes discussion of decentralization and financing of public schools, inequality of school performance by region, urban vs rural environment, and by racial and ethnic status. Schooling for groups by race and culture is discussed. The integration of multicultural education into schools is described, focusing on multicultural education policies, teacher education, and approaches to and theories of multicultural education in the US. A case study of multicultural reform in 1 school is provided to illustrate the authors' points.

The achievers are described as they sought to transform their ""multiple selves"" as Black persons, as women and men, and as members of social classes in transition between the ""multiple worlds"" of their families, schooling, and peers. They accomplished their self-transformations through the use of contrasting strategies of self-negation, self-fragmentation, and self-synthesis that were adapted in response to conflicting cultural expectations. This investigation offers crucial insights into the nature and consequences of the identity work of African American youths in urban educational contexts.

This was accomplished by (a) using the ORAS-P to determine 300 White undergraduate students' WRC type, (b) assessing and rank ordering student preferences for 14 different counselor characteristics, and (c) examining the relationship between WRC type and preferences for counselor characteristics. The ORAS-P was found to be a reliable instrument, but, evidence for the construct validity of the WRC model was inconsistent. As hypothesized, more than 70% (i.e., 82%) of students preferred an ethnically similar counselor to an ethnically dissimilar counselor. Further, students' preferences for counselor characteristics were in the expected rank order (i.e., similar attitudes/values, more education, similar personality, older) and very similar to those of students of the same and different ethnicities in other similar studies. There was a high correlation between the rank orderings of preferred counselor characteristics among the WRC types with all types showing most preference for the same three characteristics (i.e., similar attitudes/values, more education, similar personality). There was also a high correlation between male and female rank orderings with the same four characteristics ranked highest by both genders (i.e., similar attitudes/values, more education, similar personality, older). Prior counseling experience was found to have no relationship to either preference for ethnicity or counselor characteristics in general. Support for the hypothesized relationship between student WRC type and preference for counselor ethnicity varied by mode of analysis. Support for the hypothesized relationship between students' gender and WRC type was supported regardless of the mode of analysis. These findings suggest that the WRC model and the ORAS-P require additional validation prior to application and that similar counselor ethnicity is preferred less than other counselor characteristics among (a) White undergraduate students regardless of WRC type, gender, or prior counseling experience and (b) undergraduate students regardless of ethnicity.

Five to 42 college students completed the PADAA at each institution; 215 responses were used for analysis. Results indicate that preservice physical educators may respect and value cultural diversity, but because scores decreased as the level of intensity of the scales increased, preservice students may be less likely to implement culturally sensitive teaching practices to meet the individual needs of all students. Findings suggest that teacher educators should work toward not only sensitizing prospective teachers to culturally diverse students, but need to guide and encourage these future educators in adopting and implementing educational programs that are responsive to cultural diversity. To accomplish this goal, it is recommended that teacher educators specifically provide opportunities for preservice students to implement pluralistic teaching practices.

Several conceptualizations of ethnic diversity have influenced schools, including assimilation defined as Anglo-conformity, assimilation defined as ""melting pot,"" and cultural pluralism. Since the 1960s, multicultural education has become an umbrella term for a variety of approaches to ethnic and cultural pluralism. James A. Banks of the University of Washington, Carl A. Grant of the University of Wisconsin, and Asa G. Hilliard III of Georgia State University are three contemporary African American theorists who have been writing about multicultural education since the 1960s. Six questions are posed of their published work: (1) How is multicultural education for schools defined? (2) What are the implications of multicultural education for curriculum and instruction? (3) How are individual and group rights and responsibilities defined and related to each other? (4) What are the implications of multicultural education for human relations within schools? (5) What are the implications of multicultural education for the structural organization of schools? (6) What justification for multicultural education is offered through empirical, historical, and philosophical analysis? In the final chapter, a critical analysis of the work of James Banks, Carl Grant, and Asa Hilliard locates them within the broader context of multicultural education research in the United States. Banks' typologies of Ethnic Revitalization Movements and Stages of Ethnic and Cultural Development, and his identification of five dimensions of multicultural education are important theoretical contributions to multicultural education research. Although he is as critical of educational inequity as are Grant and Hilliard, Banks views multicultural education as consistent with the American democratic tradition and argues that a core of common values derived (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"views on multicultural education & its implications for curriculum & instruction & human relations & school's structural organizations, contemporary African American theorists","*Curriculum Development

They provide sharp contrasts to those who understand mixed marriages solely in the context of intergroup relations, social control, and social dominance. They hit directly at popular myths and fears. These narratives illustrate the artificiality of social constructs like ethnicity, race and culture.

The impact of the European-American worldview as the foundation of the dominant culture is explored as it relates to psychology. Implicit and explicit examples of ethnocentrism, which reflect the imposition of the dominant culture on other cultures, are offered. Universal psychology is challenged for the 21st century as culture-bound and is subsequently viewed as nonexistent. Organizational and individual multicultural development models are advanced, along with specific strategies for how doctoral programs can embrace diversity through commitment to structural change and inclusion of paradigms that reflect alternate worldviews.

Edited Book",,"(from the introduction) This is a book about communication in cultural contexts, its meaningfulness to situated participants, the local forms it takes, and the moral orders created as participants interact socially. The chapters in the book explore how communication displays membership in communities, as well as the dynamics involved when persons from one community contact those from another. This book has three main parts, with each addressing questions at the forefront of cultural communication inquiry. The first part explores how some communication patterns give voice to culture through the construction, and evaluation, of cultural identities. Part II explores moments when culture patterns of communication contact one another, with special attention given to interactional sources of asynchrony. And, the third part is concerned with comparative study of cultural patterns, exploring how communication theory can achieve a cross-cultural utility without losing its cultural sensitivity. Each part of the book includes three main sections. First is a chapter that introduces the part. . . . The heart of each part includes readings that report original field work about communication patterns, by authors who have lived them. . . . Finally, and rather unusually, each part includes original epilogues to the field work reports that typically include reflections of the authors on their work, but sometimes includes commentary by another.

Authored Book",,"(from the jacket) ""Forked Tongue"" is a devastating inside account of how the twenty-year-old experiment in bilingual education has failed our language-minority children-and why. Rosalie Porter, a distinguished educator who herself entered the American school system with no English, draws on local, state, and international experience to provide us with the first authoritative account of which policies, programs, and practices actually succeed with the children they are intended to serve. Without for a moment denying that language-minority children need special assistance, she argues forcefully that such assistance must first bring them into the mainstream of American education. And she shows concretely how this can be done without loss of cultural identity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,,"*Bilingual Education

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) This volume is designed to assess the nature and progress of American race relations in the 1980s and to make projections about trends and proposals for the 1990s. In discussing the nature of race relations in contemporary society, the volume reflects a social-structural rather than a psychological or social-psychological approach. The current status of U.S. race relations is examined here in terms of (a) the educational, social, and economic progress of racial minorities in contrast to that of the majority group and (b) the extent to which desegregation and ethnic diversity have been achieved in present-day U.S. society. Again, our focus is quite different from that of earlier studies, which concentrated on racial attitudes rather than on racial behavior and racial progress. Most of the chapters assume a power-conflict perspective that emphasizes structural relations and power dynamics between majority and minority groups. The volume focuses on the three most underrepresented racial minorities in the United States: blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians.

In such research, one is primarily interested in testing the generality of findings and interpretations about how certain social institutions operate or about how certain aspects of social structure impinge on personality. My rationale for the first part of the book is the most self-evident: this is a set of papers dealing with general theoretical and methodological issues in cross-national research. Most of the remaining chapters-more than half of the book-use nation as the ""context"" for inquiry. These analyses investigate whether social processes that occur in one nation or one type of nation are similar to or different from social processes that occur in other nations or other types of nations.

Contributions by social scientists to the debate over the death penalty in this country have been confined largely to close scrutiny of two major issues: whether the death penalty as actually employed is a deterrent (and, especially, whether it is a better deterrent than imprisonment) and whether its use is arbitrary and discriminatory (especially against racial minorities). These two books break new ground and complement each other in their orientation. Zimring and Hawkins propose a version of cultural pluralism to characterize the death penalty in the United States. Otterbein begins his volume with a complaint against his fellow social scientists to the effect that they ""have avoided conducting any studies that might show the social functions of capital punishment"". He proposes to remedy this lack by examining data in the Human Relations Area Files on nearly three dozen (mostly primitive) cultures.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) Unique in its honest confrontation with real problems and its challenge to many assumptions and practices in education and public policy, this book rests on the conviction that equal opportunity in formal education is necessary but not sufficient to enable students to achieve socioeconomic success in adult life. The author demonstrates the importance of social relations that are not restricted to the classroom, such as mutually shared values and communication patterns. By focusing on the clash of socioeconomic styles that often coincides with desegregation, Hanna offers explanations for aggressive and other disruptive school behavior and then presents coping strategies for parents, teachers, governments, the private sector, and concerned citizens. ""Disruptive School Behavior"" illuminates widespread educational problems on a national scale.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"There is often an unwillingness to correlate the technique and the philosophy of the group therapist. Those nations which have a generally homogeneous population are able to use techniques which may be considered non-invasive and appear to be able to accomplish a good deal of clinical progress. The USA, my native land, a collection of fifty states and territories, with a population that migrated from many shores, is the site of many competing techniques of clinical intervention. These clinical interventions mesh with the heterogeneity of the country. Indeed, the cultural pluralism that is so much a part of the fabric of the USA is wedded to many of the group psychotherapy techniques that are at work in the USA.

Results were compared to similar studies conducted since 1932. It was found that the image of whites, predominantly one of progressivism, individualism, and intelligence in previous testing from 1932 to 1960, changed in the 1970 testing to an emphasis on materialism and hedonism, especially in the eyes of politically active Japanese American Ss. The classical primitive image held of the blacks from 1932 to 1950 contrasted with the 1970 image of aggressiveness and straightforwardness along with their persistent trait of musicality. The Japanese image had emerged in 1970 as ambitious, industrious, loyal to family, reserved, and quiet. The greater degree of stereotypy among racial images which in the 1930's tended to support white ascendancy has become more diversified to accommodate the changing ideological transformation from white ascendancy to cultural pluralism.

An argument is advanced that research in plural societies requires a new model, one that draws primarily upon the cross-cultural model, reflecting an ideology of cultural pluralism, so that the independence and uniqueness of each group in the comparison may be respected. A transethnic model is proposed for conducting comparative studies of ethunits in polyethnic societies. Guidelines for assessing issues of comparability, group independence, and the number of groups in the comparison and their cultural characteristics are discussed.

The book is intended to encourage on the part of classroom English teachers an acceptance of cultural pluralism recognition of the value of the cultural and linguistic backgrounds of minority-group students. Much of the writing on the education of Black children emphasizes the differences and contrasts between standard and Black English. Such writing frequently concludes that English textbooks basic readers and spellers in particular-should be redesigned to build from the language norms students bring to the school setting. A somewhat different view is presented by the author who reports a study of the speech of five Black children. The children he studied used a mixture of non-standard and standard dialect variants. Unmarked plural and possessive, for example, were less frequent than the marked, standard variants. In the decade ahead, applied linguists may be called upon to help classroom teachers recognize and teach those children whose language norms are neither identical with nor totally different from the standard, school norms.

He used English and French words, sometimes with a German prefix or suffix, in connection with those aspects of the self that Freud experienced simultaneously as familiar and mysterious. He used Latin and Ancient Greek words and mythological figures and legends to formulate his theories and the Unconscious (e.g., interpretation of dreams). According to the author, psychoanalysts need a linguistic and cultural pluralism in their background similar to Freud's, which provides the intermediary thoughts, or compromise formations for their preconscious elaborations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Reviews the history of the studies of IQ that took place at the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station in the 1930's and 1940's, which suggested that the IQs of young children could be dramatically boosted or depressed under specified environmental conditions. It is argued that the Station's scientists arrived at their conclusions primarily because they responded to larger, if often tacit, ways of perceiving reality programmed into American culture itself. It was in the mid-1920's that cultural pluralism and cultural relativism came into their own as important cultural and intellectual movements. It was in those years that the final phases of the heredity-environment controversy were taking place, and the Station scientists argued for the importance of the social environment in the development of IQ, and they were critical of the excesses of the mental testing movement. The scientists later became involved in campaigning for a national system of preschool education and in conducting research with children in state institutions. These projects led the researchers to consider themselves as part of the child welfare profession, rather than part of academic psychology.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Proposes that, within the field of education, cultural pluralism (CP) offers the right of every American child to maintain his/her identity with home and community socialization experiences. CP rejects the deficit model, which holds that children from minority culture (MC) backgrounds often come to school with cultural and linguistic defects that must be remedied. It is not suggested that English is not to be a part of the curriculum, but it is suggested that English acquisition should be an additive process, not a replacement. In terms of special education, CP is a factor because many MC children are placed in special education due to cultural, linguistic, and/or racial differences. In many public schools, cultural differences are still translated as deviant, deficient, disabled, and/or disadvantaged. For lack of a better label, many are identified as learning disabled. For those MC students who do have handicaps, the issue of cultural differences is as pertinent to their education as the issue of their learning disabilities. The problems associated with identifying disabilities in MC youngsters are complicated by a lack of understanding of the various cultures; discrimination associated with referral, assessment instruments, and placement; and the virtual nonexistence of teacher training and certification programs that combine special and bilingual/multicultural education methods.

It is noted that both of these tenets must be kept in the counselor's frame of reference, a difficult task in light of the extensive and complex social changes taking place throughout the world. The importance of cultural pluralism and the search for a positive cultural identity has paralleled the global acceptance of and desire for technological change. Examples of the harmonious integration of these developments, such as in Japan, and of cultures where conflict has arisen, such as among Blacks in Africa, are presented. Four qualities-empathy, skill in communication, sensitivity, and willingness to inform clients about the nature of the counseling process-are regarded as important for therapists and counselors in this context. Techniques for training counselors to be effective in cross-cultural situations are outlined. The particular problems encountered by foreign students in adapting to their new environments are described, and research projects designed to address these issues are proposed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Argues that 2 tasks need to be addressed in view of psychology's growing commitment to cultural pluralism in research, theory, and professional practice: The 1st is that ethnic minority group issues are analogous to antinomies in which cherished values and principles are pitted against one another and need to be recognized as such. These paradoxes are evident in at least 5 conflicts: emic vs etic studies, mainstreaming vs pluralism, equal opportunity vs equality of outcome, modal personality vs individual differences, and presence vs absence of racism today. Attempts to find a single, permanent solution are fruitless; the resolution of these issues should be an ongoing process requiring divergent reasoning and diverse solutions. The 2nd task involves the acquisition of power and influence, since means for implementing proposed solutions are necessary. A brief history is provided of ethnic minority efforts in the governing structure of the American Psychological Association. It is suggested that the search for diverse solutions and the attainment of institutionalized influence are vital in increasing pluralism.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Majority-minority relations have historically taken the forms of elimination, segregation, fusion, assimilation, or pluralism. Cultural pluralism, the dominant ideology in the world today, is based on the assumptions of tolerance on the part of the majority and a willingness to learn on the part of the minority (acculturation). It is argued that modern theories of acculturation have tended to neglect the importance of individual differences in the process of adaptation. The socioanalytic model based on psychological role theory and studies of natural language is presented. It offers a model of acculturation that accounts for individual differences as well as the situational factors that affect acculturation.

The dangers and pitfalls of therapy without understanding the patient in his cultural milieu are emphatically outlined. The need to distinguish pathological conflict is stressed. Seward presents many suggestions about the suitability of types of therapy for different cultural groups, such as the questionable use of long-term insight therapies with lower-class patients who present attitudes toward time that stress immediacy. She indicates the usefulness of folk medicine, suggestion, and ritual in crisis intervention and in cases where more formal therapeutic methods could not possibly bridge the communication barriers.

The development of black consciousness among American Negroes is used as an example of the influence toward cultural pluralism exerted by TV. The former identity of the Negro, largely bound to interpersonal relationships on a local level, has been weakened by a rise in distrust and fear of violence in the ghetto. Concurrent with the resulting turning inward is an increasing reliance on TV, both for information about the outside world, and for development of a ""symbolic community"" to replace the lost interpersonal community. The co-occurrence of these 2 processes has contributed significantly to the heightened black consciousness. It is suggested that future developments in mass communications may have similar effects on other interest groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Reviews previous studies of racial stereotypes and compares changes with current stereotypes. A sample of 100 white, 100 black, and 100 Japanese students at Sacramento State College were administered the same instrument as in the 1932 Katz and Braly study. In earlier studies whites had been described as intelligent, ambitious, industrious, materialistic, and pleasure-loving. In 1970 white traits emphasized were materialistic, pleasure-loving, straightforward, and ambitious. Earlier studies of black stereotypes held them to be superstitious, slovenly, religious, happy-go-lucky, ignorant, and pleasure-loving. The 1970 image had shifted radically to include aggressiveness and straightforwardness along with the persistent black trait of musicality. The Japanese stereotypes of intelligence, industriousness, and progressiveness showed a relative lack in consensus, but in 1970 showed greater stereotypy than in earlier studies. By 1950 racial images had become more diversified and less stereotypical, reflecting the changing ideology from white conformity to cultural pluralism. Current tendencies reveal a trend toward reverse racism, re-emphasizing racial distinctions which had previously become blurred. (35 ref.)

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Cultural diversity commonly is the rallying point for conflict within European nations; the linguistic pluralism in Switzerland is a striking exception. The equilibrium among the 4 national languages of Switzerland originated before language became a symbol of nationalism and has been maintained by demographic factors-differential fertility among the language groups, offset by trends in internal migration-and political measures designed to prevent language groups from attaining a minority status.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Using results of a field study of the Pomo (Calif.) Indians as an example, 3 types of interpopulational participation are considered: (1) amalgamation (total participation), which was opposed by both whites and Indians, (2) cultural pluralism (negative participation), which was accepted verbally by both, and (3) dominance-submission (restrictive participation), accepted verbally by a majority of older white residents. ""In cases where both groups are opposed to the three types of solutions, there remains but one realistic program, namely a conscious program of ever-increasing functionally integrated participation.""
