Peer Reviewed Journal","The present study compared the prevalence and variation in high-risk sexual behaviors among four monoracial (i.e., White, African American, Asian, Native American) and four multiracial (i.e., White/African American, White/Asian, White/Native American, African American/Native American) young adults using Wave IV data (2008-2009) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 9724). Findings indicated differences in the sexual behavior of monoracial and multiracial young adults, but directions of differences varied depending on the monoracial group used as the referent and gender. Among males, White/African Americans had higher risk than Whites; White/Native Americans had higher risk than Native Americans. Otherwise, multiracial groups had lower risk or did not differ from the single-race groups. Among females, White/Native Americans had higher risk than Whites; White/African Americans had higher risk than African Americans. Other comparisons showed no differences or had lower risk among multiracial groups. Variations in high-risk sexual behaviors underscore the need for health research to disaggregate multiracial groups to better understand health behaviors and outcomes in the context of experiences associated with a multiracial background, and to improve prevention strategies.

Peer Reviewed Journal","While the black population of the USA has grown more diverse with regard to ethnicity and class status, most research on racial identity relies on dichotomous proxies of racial group identification created during the civil rights era. Using a subset of the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity included in the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, a representative sample of black students at twenty-eight selective American colleges and universities, we test how black student racial identity is related to students' ethnic, nativity, socioeconomic, and contextual experiences in childhood. Our more nuanced measure of black racial identity shows that being Black/African American is central to the new generation of black elites' self-identity and that, contrary to prior evidence and theorization that blacks are either assimilationist or nationalist, that black students express strong support for both assimilationist and nationalist ideological beliefs at the same time. In addition, students express strong tendencies toward group membership as well as individualism; race has less of an impact on how they feel about themselves and their social relationships. Further analyses reveal substantial variation in black identity between monoracial and mixed-race blacks, and between immigrant (both first and second generation) and native blacks, but few social class differences. Notably, childhood experiences of racial segregation and social disorganization are also strongly associated with black identity and racial ideologies.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The U.S. multiracial population has grown substantially in the past decades, yet little is known about how these individuals are positioned in the racial hierarchies of the dating market. Using data from one of the largest dating websites in the United States, we examine how monoracial daters respond to initial messages sent by multiracial daters with various White/non-White racial and ethnic makeups. We test four different theories: hypodescent, multiracial in-betweenness, White equivalence, and what we call a multiracial dividend effect. We find no evidence for the operation of hypodescent. Asian-White daters, in particular, are afforded a heightened status, and Black-White multiracials are treated as an in-between group. For a few specific multiracial gender groups, we find evidence for a dividend effect, where multiracial men and women are preferred above all other groups, including Whites.

Peer Reviewed Journal","People give widely varying estimates for the amount of genetic overlap that exists between humans. While some laypeople believe that humans are highly genetically similar to one another, others believe that humans share very little genetic overlap. These studies examine how beliefs about genetic overlap affect neural and evaluative reactions to racially-ambiguous and biracial targets. In Study 1, we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted a stronger neural avoidance response to biracial compared to monoracial targets. In Study 2, we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted longer response times to classify biracial (vs. monoracial) faces into racial categories. In Study 3, we manipulated genetic overlap beliefs and found that participants in the low overlap condition explicitly rated biracial targets more negatively than those in the high overlap condition. Taken together, these data suggest that genetic overlap beliefs influence perceivers' processing fluency and evaluation of biracial and racially-ambiguous individuals.

Having more than one racial heritage has a direct impact on how these children are seen by others as well as how they understand and encounter the world around them. Parents socialize their children in matters of race and discrimination that can impact their racial identity development, which is a component of their overall identity development. The aim of this study was explore how multiracial children are socialized and the impact of that socialization on racial identity formation from a heuristic perspective. Heuristic inquiry is a facet of phenomenology that seeks to understand the researcher's experience of the phenomenon; therefore, I provided data on my experiences with raising a mixed-race child in a monoracial family. Two other families experiencing the same phenomenon were also interviewed. Themes related to racial profiling, parental perception of the mixed race child's personality, skin tone, level of respect, and parenting were identified through the five-step analysis process recommended by Moustakas for heuristic inquiry, including immersion, incubation, illumination, explication, and creative synthesis. This study highlights relevant aspects in the lives of mixed-race children, how that impacts the way society views mixed-race individuals, and how those individuals encounter the world around them.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Rigid thinking is associated with less creativity, suggesting that priming a flexible mind-set should boost creative thought. In three studies, we investigate whether priming multiple social identities predicts more creativity in domains unrelated to social identity. Study 1 asked monoracial and multiracial participants to write about their racial identities before assessing creativity. Priming a multiracial's racial identity led to greater creativity compared to a no-prime control. Priming a monoracial's racial identity did not affect creativity. Study 2 showed that reminding monoracials that they, too, have multiple identities increased creativity. Study 3 replicated this effect and demonstrated that priming a multiracial identity for monoracials did not affect creativity. These results are the first to investigate the association between flexible identities and flexible thinking, highlighting the potential for identity versatility to predict cognitive differences between individuals who have singular versus multifaceted views of their social selves.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Reviews the book, Mixed: Multiracial College Students Tell Their Life Stories edited by Andrew Garrod, Robert Kilkenny, & Christina Gomez (2014). This book presents multiracial student essays focusing on growing up and living as a mixed-race individual in a society founded on monoracial understandings of race. The purpose of the book is ""to capture the phenomenology of being mixed-race in a compelling way, and in so doing to inspire, engage, and move our readers"". The edited book contains 12 narratives written by self-identified multiracial students: six men and six women, either current students or recent graduates of Dartmouth College. The introduction provides an important context for the 12 narratives. The book concludes rather abruptly with no discussion of how the 12 narratives may inform higher education research and practice.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Multiracial individuals report that the social pressure of having to ""choose"" one of their racial groups is a primary source of psychological conflict. Yet because of their ability to maneuver among their multiple identities, multiracials also adopt flexible cognitive strategies in dealing with their social environments-demonstrating a benefit to having multiple racial identities. The current article reviews recent research involving multiracial participants to examine the behavioral and cognitive outcomes linked to being multiracial and pinpoints possible moderators that may affect these outcomes. Limitations in applying monoracial identity frameworks to multiracial populations are also discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","This study used archival data to examine how White, Black, and biracial Black/White people respond to implicit attitude feedback suggesting that they harbor racial bias that does not align with their self-reported attitudes. The results suggested that people are generally defensive in response to feedback indicating that their implicit attitudes differ from their explicit attitudes. Among monoracial White and Black individuals, this effect was particularly strong when they learned that they were implicitly more pro-White than they indicated explicitly. By contrast, biracial Black/White individuals were defensive about large discrepancies in either direction (more pro-Black or more pro-White implicit attitudes). These results pinpoint one distinct difference between monoracial and biracial populations and pave the way for future research to further explore how monoracial majority, minority, and biracial populations compare in other types of attitudes and responses to personal feedback.

For example, it is assumed that multiracial individuals have been expected to identify as monoracial African-Americans as a result of legal and social constructions. In addition, theoretical literature suggests that this group of individuals have faced challenges in their racial identity development, struggling with various possible racial identities. Racial identity development and self-concept formation begins in childhood and is greatly impacted by the attitudes of adults. The present study examined racial differences in college students' attitudes toward multiracial children. In addition, this study looked at these attitudes as compared to college students' attitudes toward monoracial children. For the purpose of the current study, multiracial is defined as having parents from two differing monoracial groups. The sample included 275 undergraduate students (185 White/European-American and 90 Black/African-American). Participants were assigned one of three vignettes in which the race of the child was manipulated, and subsequently completed the Attitudes toward Multiracial Children Scale (AMCS), or modified version of this scale, and Social Distance Scale (SDS) based on the child in the vignette. In addition, participants completed the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale and a demographics survey. Based on the theoretical assumptions regarding multiracial individuals, it was hypothesized that Black/African-Americans would rate multiracial children higher on scales of Self-Esteem and Psychosocial Adjustment, as compared to White/European-Americans. However, on Multiracial Heritage and Multiracial Identity subscales, it was expected that there would be no differences between the two racial groups. In addition, it was predicted that on the SDS, Black/African-Americans would have more negative ratings of multiracial children compared to African-American children, and White/European-Americans would have more negative ratings of multiracial children compared to European-American children. Results of this study indicated that the Black/African-American and White/European-American college students had similar attitudes toward the multiracial child. In addition, the monoracial participants' ratings of multiracial children did not differ significantly from their ratings of monoracial children of their same race or another race. Interestingly, White/European-Americans had ratings reflecting more positive views of multiracial heritage when the multiracial child's father was African-American and mother was European-American. Results of this study support a progression toward similar racial attitudes of Black/African-American and White/European-American young adults toward multiracial children and provide some insight into the current state of racial attitudes. In addition, this study highlights potential problems with current available measures of racial attitudes, particularly toward multiracial population.

Consistent with this hypothesis, feminine faces compelled White categorizations, and masculine faces compelled Asian or Black categorizations of racially ambiguous targets (Study 1), monoracial targets (Study 2), and real facial photographs (Study 3). The efficiency of judgments varied concomitantly. White categorizations were rendered more rapidly for feminine, relative to masculine faces, but the opposite was true for Asian and Black categorizations (Studies 1-3). Moreover, the effect of gender on categorization efficiency was compelled by racial phenotypicality for Black targets (Study 3). Finally, when targets' race prototypicality was held constant, gender still influenced race categorizations (Study 4). These findings indicate that race categorizations are biased by presumably unrelated gender cues.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Demographic trends suggest increasing numbers of multiple racial heritage students attending U.S. campuses and universities, a change reflected within psychology. However, there is little empirical investigation into the educational experiences and needs of multiracials. The current study (the second in a series of studies to use data from a national survey of psychology graduate and undergraduate students) compared 2 multiracial groups, Asian American/European American and Latino/a/European Americans, with their single-heritage counterparts on several variables of interest-academic supports and barriers, linkage between barriers faced and ethnicity, and perceived cultural diversity. Results indicated that multiracial groups reported more of a link between academic barriers experienced and their ethnicity than European American students, but less of a link than their monoracial minority peers. No differences between groups were found related to academic supports, academic barriers, and perceived cultural diversity. Study limitations, future research, and implications are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Among emerging adults and college students, racial and ethnic minorities experience greater risk for suicidal ideation and behavior than their White counterparts. Research has identified numerous cognitive risk factors for suicidal ideation. However, they have not been well studied among racial and ethnic minorities. The present study examined the association between these factors (brooding rumination, reflective rumination, hopelessness, and depressive symptoms) and suicidal ideation among 690 Black, Latino, and biracial college students. Among all groups, hopelessness was positively associated with suicidal ideation. Brooding was negatively associated with suicidal ideation, after adjusting for reflection and hopelessness, although only at low levels of depressive symptoms. Black race/ethnicity and Latino race/ethnicity, compared with biracial race/ethnicity, each separately interacted with reflection to predict lower levels of suicidal ideation at moderate to high levels of reflection. Furthermore, Latino race/ethnicity, compared with biracial race/ethnicity, interacted with both reflection and depressive symptoms, such that reflection was negatively associated with suicidal ideation among Latino individuals reporting depressive symptoms above the 39th percentile. Biracial race/ethnicity, compared with monoracial race/ethnicity, also interacted with reflection and depressive symptoms, with reflection associated with greater amounts of suicidal ideation at depressive symptom levels above the 39th percentile. Our findings suggest reflective rumination differentially affects racial and ethnic groups and should be considered in conjunction with depressive symptoms among Latino and biracial individuals in suicide risk assessment and treatment.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Children prefer learning from, and affiliating with, their racial in-group but those preferences may vary for biracial children. Monoracial (White, Black, Asian) and biracial (Black/White, Asian/White) children (N = 246, 3-8 years) had their racial identity primed. In a learning preferences task, participants determined the function of a novel object after watching adults (White, Black, and Asian) demonstrate its uses. In the social preferences task, participants saw pairs of children (White, Black, and Asian) and chose with whom they most wanted to socially affiliate. Biracial children showed flexibility in racial identification during learning and social tasks. However, minority-primed biracial children were not more likely than monoracial minorities to socially affiliate with primed racial in-group members, indicating their in-group preferences are contextually based.

Despite some social recognition of Black-White persons as multiracial, racial microaggressions persist in daily life. Subtle racist acts (Sue, Capodilupo, Torino, Bucceri, Holder, Nadal, & Esquilin, 2007b) negatively impact multiracial identity development. Since 2007, studies have increasingly focused on the impact of racial microaggressions on particular monoracial ethnic groups. Johnston and Nadal (2010) delineated general racial microaggressions for multiracial people. This project examines the effects of racial microaggressions on the multiracial identity development of 11 part-Black multiracial university students, including the concerns and challenges they face in familial, academic, and social racial identity formation. Data were analyzed through a typological analysis and Racial and Multiracial Microaggressions typologies (Johnston & Nadal, 2010; Sue et al., 2007b). Three themes arose: (a) the external societal pressure for the multiracial person to identify monoracially; (b) the internalized struggle within the mixed-race person to create a cohesive self-identity; and (c) the assertion of a multiracial identity. Participants experienced Racial Microaggressions (Sue, 2010a; Sue et al., 2007b), Multiracial Microaggressions (Johnston & Nadal, 2010), and Monoracial Stereotypes (Nadal, Wong, Griffin, Sriken, Vargas, Wideman, & Kolawole, 2011). Implications included encouraging a multiracial identity, educating the school community, and eliminating racial microaggressions and stereotypes.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Although multiracial individuals are the fastest growing population in the United States, research on the identity development of multiracial adolescents remains scant. This study explores the relationship between ethnic identity, its components (affirmation, exploration), and mental health outcomes (anxiety, depressive symptoms) within the contexts of schools for multiracial adolescents. The participants were multiracial and monoracial minority and majority high school students (n = 4,766; 54.6 % female). Among the participants, 88.1 % were Caucasian, 7.4 % were African American, and 4.5 % were multiracial. The research questions examined the relationship between ethnic identity exploration and affirmation on mental health outcomes and explored the role school context plays in this relationship. The findings suggested that multiracial youth experience more exploration and less affirmation than African Americans, but more than Caucasians. In addition, multiracial youth were found to have higher levels of mental health issues than their monoracial minority and majority peers. Specifically, multiracial youth had higher levels of depressive symptoms than their African American and Caucasian counterparts. Multiracial and Caucasian youth had similar levels of anxiety but these levels were significantly higher than African Americans. School diversity did not influence mental health outcomes for multiracial youth. These findings provide insight into the experiences of multiracial youth and underscore the importance of further investigating factors that contribute to their mental health outcomes.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Using Holland et al.'s (Identity and agency in cultural worlds, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1998) theory of identity and their concept of figured worlds, this article provides an overview of how twenty-five undergraduates of color came to produce a Multiracial identity. Using Critical Race Theory methodology with ethnographic interviewing as the primary method, I specifically focus on the ways in which Multiracial figured worlds operate within a racial borderland (Anzaldua in Borderlands: La Frontera-The New Mestiza, Aunt Lute Books, San Francisco, 1987), an alternate, marginal world where improvisational play (Holland et al. in Identity and agency in cultural worlds, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1998) and facultad became critical elements of survival. Participants exercised their agency by perforating monoracial storylines and developed a complex process of identity production that informed their behaviors by a multifaceted negotiation of positionalities. I end by focusing on implications for urban education that can be drawn from this study.

Overall, findings provide evidence of an appearance-identity link as well as potential gender differences in outcomes. Regardless of others' racial/ethnic assumptions, females endorsed higher levels of ethnic identity associated with their minority backgrounds as well as higher biracial self-identification than their male counterparts. Furthermore, participants who reported that they appeared as and were correctly identified as belonging to their minority group endorsed higher ethnic identity associated with that group than individuals who appeared White. With regard to biracial self-identification, those with ambiguous physical appearances and/or who experienced social invalidation, endorsed higher biracial self-identification than those who appeared and were more often categorized as Monoracial by others and/or as they preferred. Results highlight the transactional nature of bi/multiracial identity processes, particularly for females, and provides more understanding of social invalidation effects, which is a frequent ""bi/multiracial"" experience. Finally, qualitative results support previous findings that outline several identity options bi/multiracial individuals adhere to or embrace as they navigate their social environments.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Adding to the growing literature explicating the links between romantic relationships and health, this study examined how both couple-level characteristics, particularly union type (e.g., dating, cohabiting, or marriage) and interracial pairing, and interpersonal characteristics (e.g., partner strain and support), predicted young adults' physical and mental health. Using dyadic data from a sample of 249 young, primarily Black couples, we hypothesized and found support for the importance of couple-level context, partner behavior, and their interaction in predicting health. Interracial couples (all Black/non-Black pairings) reported worse health than monoracial Black couples. Union type, however, did not directly predict health but was a significant moderator of partner strain. That is, the negative association between partner strain and self-reported health was stronger for cohabiting and married couples versus their dating counterparts, suggesting that coresidence, more so than marital status, may be important for understanding partner effects on physical health. For psychological distress, however, partner support proved equally beneficial across union types.

With mixed heritage youth doubling in the past ten years, higher education institutions can expect an increase of this minority group. Historically higher education has responded to underrepresented student needs and designed student services for monoracial students with little consideration given to mixed heritage students. Universities are being called to examine their readiness to serve mixed heritage college students with these students attending college at a time when many problems of racial injustice remain unsolved, monoracial categorization of students is the norm, multiracial microaggressions are being demonstrated and navigation of their existence on campus is done with limited support. Despite an increase in visibility, there is a dearth of literature related to college experiences of mixed heritage students. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of mixed heritage college students in race-oriented student services and programs. Using grounded theory, the study attempted to understand multiracial college students' experiences who participate in race-oriented student services. The findings suggest that mixed heritage student experiences on campus and in programs and student organizations are different from their monoracial peers in how they consider their eligibility for services, develop racial identification, demonstrate racial authenticity, participate in monoracial focused programming and experience multiracial microaggressions. Implications for higher education and future research are discussed.

Of the individuals who identified (or whose parents/guardians identified them) as multiracial, 4.2 million were younger than 18 years of age (www.uscensus.gov). Given that social scientists predict that the multiracial population is increasing so that up to one in five people might identify as multiracial by 2050 (Lee & Bean, 2004), it is critical that researchers examine various aspects of multiracial experiences, including the ways that multiracial youth understand complex concepts such as race, ethnicity, and culture. This two-part study addresses the gap in literature on intergenerational ethnic-racial socialization processes within interracial families and ethnic cognition among multiracial adolescents. In Study 1, monoracial parents of multiracial children (ages 2-22) completed a survey about ethnic-racial socialization practices, colorblind attitudes, ethnic identity, parent psychological distress, and child psychosocial functioning, and demographic characteristics. Parental ethnic racial socialization beliefs and practices were related to ethnic identity, colorblind attitudes, and parents' received socialization. In Study 2, multiracial 7th through 12th grade students completed a survey about their perceptions of parental ethnic-racial socialization, ethnic identity, psychosocial functioning, and demographic characteristics. In addition, multiracial adolescents participated in a semi-structured interview to assess Ethnic Perspective Taking Abilities (EPTA; Quintana, 1994). Results support the use of the EPTA model with multiracial youth to assess their understandings of race, ethnicity, and inter-group relations.

Vol.74(7-B(E)),2014, pp. No Pagination Specified.",0419-4217,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"This dissertation examines the unique stressors of multiracial people in the United States and how substance use may play a factor in these experiences. There is a lack of research on this fast growing demographic making research on this population vital. Included is a literature review of the history of multiracial people in the United States, which helps to explain how multiracial people fit into American society. The unique experiences that can be stressors to multiracial people are also highlighted. Studies on the relationship between stress and discrimination and young adults' use of substances are then discussed. Next, recent research on perceived discrimination and substance abuse amongst multiracial people is examined. Most research shows that multiracial adolescents are at higher risk to use substances than monoracial adolescents. As such, it is hypothesized that the same results will be found with young adults and that the higher level of substance use is mediated by perceived discrimination. Results of the study however, revealed no significant difference between the overall level of substance use between the monoracial and biracial group. Yet, among the overall sample, a positive correlation was found between tobacco use and perceived discrimination. Of interest, this relationship was not found for any other substances. However, the results obtained did reveal that the multiracial participant group reported significantly higher levels of perceived discrimination than the monoracial group for both within the past year and their entire lifetimes. Additionally, the multiracial group reported their experiences with discrimination as significantly more stressful than the monoracial group. The results also reveal that multiracial people experience different forms of discrimination than monoracial people. The clinical implications and discussion on future research are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The need for trauma research with monoracial groups such as Asian Americans (AAs) has recently been emphasized to better understand trauma experiences and inform interventions across populations. Given AA cultural contexts, posttraumatic cognitions and somatization may be key in understanding trauma experiences for this group. AA and White American (WA) trauma-exposed college women completed a survey on sexual trauma history, posttraumatic cognitions, somatic symptoms, and PTSD severity. For the overall sample, higher negative cognitions were associated with higher somatization. Asian race was associated with higher negative cognitions, which then predicted higher PTSD. Unexpectedly, WAs more strongly endorsed somatization than AAs. These findings indicate that posttraumatic cognitions may be helpful in understanding relationships between somatization and PTSD severity among those of Asian backgrounds and that the relationship between somatization and PTSD symptoms is culturally complex.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), this study investigates patterns of well-being among multiracial adolescents. Specifically, this article addresses three questions. First, using various categorizations for multiracial background, are there measurable differences in emotional and social well-being among White, minority, and multiracial adolescents? Second, do multiracial adolescents with a White mother tend to fare differently than those with a minority mother? Third, does variation in family-based social capital-including parental involvement, parent-child relationship quality, and family structure-contribute to observed well-being differences among multiracial and monoracial adolescents? Results suggest that multiracial adolescents experience more negative social and emotional well-being outcomes when their mother is a minority. This finding persists even when controlling for sources of family-based social capital.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Monoracial people typically encounter correct views about their race from others. Multiracial people, however, encounter different views about their race depending on the situation. As a result, multiracial (but not monoracial) people may regard race as a less visible aspect of the self that they hope others will verify during social interactions. Multiracial people should therefore value others' accuracy about their race more than monoracial people. In Study 1, multiracial and monoracial participants expected to meet a partner who was accurate or confused about their racial backgrounds. Multiracial (but not monoracial) participants reported heightened interest in interacting with an accurate partner. In Study 2, multiracial (but not monoracial) participants perceived accurate partners as more likely than confused partners to fulfill their needs for self-verification during an interaction. Increased expectations for self-verification, moreover, explained multiracial (but not monoracial) participants' heightened interest in interacting with accurate partners. The results suggest that multiracial (but not monoracial) people view race as an aspect of the self (like personality traits or values) requiring verification from others during interactions.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Racial essentialism refers to the widely held belief that race is a biological, stable, and natural category. Although research finds very little evidence that race has biological underpinnings, racial essentialist beliefs persist and are linked to negative outgroup consequences. This study initially demonstrates that label and visual ambiguity concurrently inform racial categorization. It then tests whether exposure to racially ambiguous targets (a) challenges essentialism when ambiguous targets are labeled with biracial categories and (b) reinforces essentialism when ambiguous targets identify with monoracial categories. The results showed that White perceivers (N = 84) who were exposed to racially ambiguous, biracially labeled targets showed reductions in their essentialist thinking about race, whereas perceivers who were exposed to racially ambiguous, monoracially labeled targets showed increases in their essentialist beliefs.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The number of interracial relationships in the United States continues to increase. The fact is, though, that race remains a significant influence in the lives of individuals and in their relationships. Although there is evidence that relationships that cross racial/ethnic boundaries may be at greater risk for conflict and dissolution, there have been few investigations as to whether such relationships are at greater risk for violence. Using data from the National Violence Against Women Survey, I find that there are differences in risk of intimate violence depending on the racial/ethnic dyad of the couple. Ethnic monoracial relationships demonstrate the greatest risk for physical and nonphysical forms of violence, controlling for structural factors, whereas women in interracial relationships report higher rates of nonphysical violence, as compared with women in White monoracial relationships. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Edited Book","(from the chapter) Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to explore the intersection of identity, culture, and consumption as it relates to multiracial identity development. Methodology/approach: The authors employed a phenomenological approach wherein 21 multiracial women were interviewed to understanding the lived experience and meaning of multiracial identity development. Findings: Findings of this study indicate that multiracial consumers engage with the marketplace to assuage racial discordance and legitimize the liminal space they occupy. Research implications: While there is much research related to the variety of ways marketing and consumption practices intersect with identity (re)formation, researchers have focused much of their attention on monoracial populations. This research identifies and fills a gap in the literature related to how multiple racial backgrounds complicate this understanding. Practical implications: Due to their growing social visibility and recognized buying power, multiracial individuals have emerged as a viable consumer segment among marketers. However, there is a dearth of research examining how multiracial populations experience the marketplace. Originality/value: This study provides a better understanding of the ways in which multiracial individuals utilize consumption practices as a means of developing and expressing their racial identity.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The authors examined whether biracial (Black/White) individuals, who have access to multiple racial identities and experience with both Black and White faces, would be able to adopt the perceptual lens of a contextually salient racial identity. Biracial and monoracial perceivers wrote an essay about a time they connected with their mother's or father's ethnic identity before completing a face recognition task. The authors hypothesized that this essay prime would influence biracial perceivers' racial identification and that their memory for Black, White, and racially ambiguous faces would reflect the motivational relevance of the target face to their salient racial identity. Results indicated that biracial individuals adopted different racial identifications to guide preferential memory relevant to their salient racial identity, exhibiting memory patterns comparable to monoracial individuals' typical own-race bias. These findings suggest that ingroup memory effects depend on integration of bottom-up perceptual experience and top-down factors, such as the social relevance of faces.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Previous literature on racial self-identification among multiracials demonstrates that self-identification differs by context. Moreover, among multiracial adolescents, identity, usually measured in school, is correlated with achievement. In addition, a few studies have indicated that for half-white, half-minority adolescents, school achievement falls in between the achievements of their monoracial counterparts. Using the in-school and in-home components of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we examine the relationship between racial self-identification and school belonging and achievement. We find that among black/white and Asian/white adolescents, adolescents who self-identify as white are particularly disadvantaged in school, reporting lower grade point averages (GPA) than their multiracial counterparts. Our conclusions suggest that multiple contextual measures of self-identification better capture the relationship between racial identification and academic achievement among multiracial adolescents.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The present studies examine how White ancestry influences perceivers' minority categorization of Black/White biracial individuals, as well as the implications of minority categorization for distribution of minority resources and stereotype use. Study 1 suggests that people are less likely to categorize those of Black/White biracial descent as minority and thus are less likely to view them as appropriate recipients of affirmative action than those of Black monoracial or Black/Native American descent. Study 2 tests a model in which Black/White biracial individuals with a greater amount of White ancestry are perceived as experiencing less discrimination and are less likely to be categorized as minority; therefore, they are judged as less appropriate for minority resources.

We found an intermediate biracial phenomenon in which some biracial youth initiate substance use at ages that fall between the initiation ages of their 2 corresponding monoracial groups. When controlling for the covariates, our findings show that White-Asian biracial youth begin smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol at earlier ages than Whites and engaging in all forms of substance use at earlier ages than Asian youth. Results indicate that White-American Indian youth start smoking cigarettes at earlier ages than all biracial and monoracial groups. Our findings underscore the need for future research to examine substance-use initiation and progression among biracial/ethnic youth.

Research on multiracial individuals is gaining momentum, although the body of literature is still quite small, with most studies focusing on correlates of identifying as multiracial or predictors of wave-to-wave (e.g., 8th to 9th grade) change in identification. However, the literature is limited in two ways: I) No studies use more than two time points to determine change/stability in identification for multiracial adolescents across middle and high school and 2) Little is known about the psychosocial consequences of change/stability in identification for multiracial adolescents. In Study 1 of this dissertation, latent class analysis identified four patterns or classes of change/stability in racial identification in middle school and three classes in high school. Multinomial logistic regression identified two significant predictors of class membership: racial/ethnic diversity and parental level of education. In both middle school and high school, greater school diversity and higher levels of parental education predicted a stable multiracial identification over a stable monoracial identification. One-way MANCOVA determined the psychosocial consequences of having a fluid/stable identification. In high school only, participants with stable identifications had more positive feelings of ethnic identity than those who changed racial identification. Study 2 included data on three variables that were only collected in high school: subjective school diversity, race of best-friend, and concordance/discordance (i.e., participants' racial identifications match/do not match the perceived identification of others). Significant predictors of a stable multiracial identification over a fluid identification were experiencing discordance, having a cross-race best-friend, and greater school diversity. Participants who changed from a multiracial to a monoracial identification were more likely to experience discordance and perceive public discrimination than participants who changed from a monoracial to a multiracial identification. There were no significant psychosocial consequences of wave-to-wave change/stability in identification. The theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for studying racial self-identification of multiracial adolescents were discussed.

Biracial Asian-White American within-group differences on these variables based on type of biracial Asian-White American identity claimed were also examined. Participants were University of Hawai'i at Manoa college students (N=367) recruited from their college courses; they completed the 10-measure battery in exchange for course extra credit. Exploratory statistical analyses included ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and linear regression. Asian American and White American participants reported higher levels of Asian American and White American ethnic identity, respectively, than biracial Asian-White American participants. Biracial Asian-White American participants reported greater acculturation to White American culture than Asian American participants. Asian American participants reported the lowest levels of self-esteem and depressive symptomatology of all racial groups. Asian American ethnic identity and White American-Asian acculturation were correlated among the biracial Asian-White American and Asian American participants while self-esteem, trait anxiety, and depressive symptomatology were moderately correlated among all three racial groups. Excluding one relationship, Asian American and White American ethnic identity did not correlate with self-esteem, trait anxiety or depressive symptomatology. As predicted, biracial Asian-White American participants who integrated both racial backgrounds into their self-identity did not differ from biracial Asian-White American participants who favored one racial background over the other in regards to Asian American and White American ethnic identity, White American-Asian acculturation, self-esteem, trait anxiety, and depressive symptomatology.

Today, 9 million Americans identify with multiple races, and the election of President Obama-a son of biracial parentage-has increased public interest in multiracialism. Using a combination of national surveys and qualitative interviews, this dissertation breaks down the political ramifications of race-mixing and multiracial identity, with a focus on biracial Americans of White-Black parentage. Analyses begin with an assessment of public opinion towards interracial marriage. Findings show that expressed support for intermarriage has increased over the past decade-both through changes in attitudes and through a cohort replacement effect-driven mostly by increasingly progressive views from Whites. Expressed support is inflated by political correctness, as respondents are less likely to claim support when speaking with someone believed to be of their same racial group. Opposition to interracial marriage is not merely evidence of respondents' racial in-group preferences, but also a disfavoring towards specific racial outgroups, as some out-groups (e.g., Blacks) are considered less desirable marriage partners than others (e.g., Whites). Turning to the identities and attitudes of biracials, findings show that the majority of White-Black biracials now opt to identify as both White and Black-but that nearly 40 percent of biracials continue to subscribe to the one-drop rule, labeling themselves as singularly Black. Biracials' outlook is significantly shaped by family, sociocultural environment, religion, region, and gender. Results also indicate that ""money whitens"" biracials' self-identification; all else equal, biracials from the most affluent families are more likely to identify as singularly White or White-Black than as singularly Black. Confirming a racial assimilationist effect, biracials adopt the identity of the racial group with which they have the most contact. Regarding policy attitudes, findings show that while identification as partly Black is important in believing that racial discrimination is a major problem in society, simply being of Black heritage leads to significantly more liberal attitudes towards explicitly and implicitly racial policies. Furthermore, on issues involving women and gay rights, biracial individuals who identify as White-Black or singularly Black express more progressive views than monoracial Whites and monoracial Blacks. Interviews further break down biracials' identities, and suggest that skin color is mostly uncorrelated with racial and political loyalties. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of what the rise in intermarriage and growth of the American multiracial population means, symbolically and substantively, for the future of American race relations.

Peer Reviewed Journal","This study, using a nationally representative sample, investigated intimate partner violence (IPV) in interracial and monoracial relationships. Regression analyses indicated that interracial couples demonstrated a higher level of mutual IPV than monoracial White couples but a level similar to monoracial Black couples. There were significant gender differences in IPV, with women reporting lower levels of victimization than men. Regarding relationship status, cohabiting couples demonstrated the highest levels of IPV, and dating couples reported the lowest levels. Regarding interactions among couple racial composition, relationship status, and respondents' gender, an interaction between racial composition and relationship status was found.

Utilizing a Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) Method and a Qualitative Secondary Analysis (QSA), multiracial participants (N = 9) were interviewed in three focus groups to describe the types of microaggressions they encounter in their families. Five domains emerged including (a) isolation within the family, (b) favoritism within the family, (c) questioning of authenticity, (d) denial of multiracial identity and experiences by monoracial family members, and (e) feelings about not learning about family heritage or culture.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Despite the recent growth in multiracial children among American children, we know very little about their well-being. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class (N = 17,706), we evaluated the likelihood of living in poverty and near poverty for multiracial and monoracial children. Most multiracial groups have poverty or near poverty rates that are in between Whites and their respective minority monoracial counterparts, with Asian-Whites reporting a risk of poverty equivalent to Whites and Black-Hispanics reporting risks as high as Black and Hispanic children. Family structure and educational and occupational attainment characteristics explain some or all of the White/non-White differentials in poverty for multiracial groups, even as monoracial children still exhibit higher risk than Whites. We consider these patterns' implications for practitioners working with low-income families.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Mixed-race or multiethnic youth are at risk for mental and physical health problems. We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 to compare family characteristics of adolescents of a mixed-race or multiethnic background with those of a monoracial or monoethnic background. Mixed-race or multiethnic youth reported feeling less supported by parents and reported less satisfactory parent-adolescent relationships. Mixed-race/multiethnic youth were more like monoracial White youth in terms of being independent but were more like racial or ethnic minorities (African Americans, Hispanics) in regard to family activities. Reasons for these findings are explored. We discuss the need for future research on the experiences of mixed-race/multiethnic youth.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Objective: The present study investigates developmental trajectories of alcohol use from early adolescence to adulthood by age and race/ethnicity among White, Black, Black-American Indian, Black-Hispanic, and Black-White individuals and associated sociodemograhphic correlates. Method: We used a subsample of nationally representative data obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The analytic sample consisted of 15,278 individuals in Wave 1 (ages 11 to 21 years). The sample consists of adolescents who were in Grades 7-12 at wave one and who were followed across four waves of data collection into adulthood. Respondents could report more than one race/ethnicity. Results: We find distinct alcohol trajectories among monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks with all groups showing a cross-over or catch-up effect. Black-White adults demonstrated a cross-over effect by surpassing the alcohol drinking rates of Whites in adulthood, Black-American Indians showed a within-group catch-up effect by surpassing the alcohol drinking rates of monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks in adulthood, and monoracial Blacks were most likely to be non-drinkers in adulthood. We also show gender, socioeconomic status, and household structure differences in impact on alcohol use among monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks. Conclusions: Significant heterogeneity is observed regarding alcohol trajectories between monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks.

In addition, much of the research on racial categorization has focused on monoracial categorizations, ignoring the increasing relevance of multiracial categorization in light of growing populations of people who identify as multiracial. The present research sought to further explore how people categorize multiracial or racially ambiguous targets, doing so with an eye to how this exploration illuminates the underlying construction of race as a general concept. In addition, the present research considers what information is input into the categorization process, with an emphasis on the interaction between biologically-related and non-biological racial cues. Five studies examined this interaction between ancestry and phenotype (biological cues) and class status and self-identification (non-biological cues) in racial categorization. Across these five studies, the dominance of biological cues was consistently demonstrated, but these effects were often qualified by interactions, calling for more nuanced consideration of how people go about making racial categorization decisions. Study 1 replicated and extended previous research (Peery & Bodenhausen, 2008) by studying the interaction between ancestry and phenotype. Studies 2 and 3 examined how phenotype and ancestry interact with class status cues, and Studies 4 and 5 examined how ancestry and phenotype interact with identity cues.

Vol.74(2-A(E)),2013, pp. No Pagination Specified.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"Few studies provide data on the health of self-identified multiracial (two or more races) Americans. Subsequently, we know little about this population and existing health disparities. Three areas relevant to multiracial health include health status, health care service utilization, and health related to racial stability over the life course. Although some investigations report the health service use of children and adolescents, almost no studies report the health service use of multiracial young adults. Most studies on multiracial groups are cross-sectional and thus focus on a single time point, so it is difficult to establish how health indicators change for multiracial groups over time. This dissertation employs epidemiological methods to investigate the health of self-identified multiracial young adults in a series of three papers. There are three guiding questions in this dissertation. First, ""Do multiracial adults have better or worse self-rated health than monoracial groups?"" Second, ""Do multiracial young adults use health care services at the same rate as monoracial groups?"" Third, ""How is consistency in racial categories over time related to self-rated health for multiracial young adults in the United States?"" I used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 20,774) in-home sample taken during the period 1994-2008 to examine factors related to multiracial health as individuals enter different phases of life. Using multivariate logistic regression I tested a series of hypotheses for three distinct research questions. In the first paper, I found that there are differences in self-rated health for some multiracial groups. In the second paper, I found that there are differences in the rates of health care service utilization when comparing specific multiracial groups to the monoracial majority. In the third paper, I found that there are differences in report of self-rated health when comparing monoracial adults with multiracial adults who switch racial categories over time. These findings contribute to the wider understanding of health disparities for vulnerable populations and assist in identifying salient mechanisms of health disparities over the life course. These results also demonstrate the importance of critically examining changes in racial categories as related to health status over time.

Interviews were conducted with 12 biracial participants of non-Caucasian heritage who were between the ages of 18 and 33 years, born in the United States, spoke English fluently, and grew up with both parents present. Interviews were then transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory framework. Results: Nine participants described a biracial identity, two reported a transcendent (American) identity, and one reported a monoracial identity. Four major themes that shaped the participants' ethnic identity development process emerged: family dynamics, peer dynamics, religion/spirituality, and ethnic/cultural influences. The importance of parental influence was discussed in relation to each of the four themes, as parents significantly impacted the participants in each of these four areas. The themes also overlapped each other, demonstrating that each theme was significantly impacted by the other three. Furthermore, the themes changed over time as new information and events were experienced such as increased education, racism/discrimination, and new relationships. The concept of integration was examined, specifically in relation to its use as a strength and source of resiliency for the participant. Integration was examined as an explanation for the majority of individuals adopting a biracial identity. Clinical implications for therapy with biracial young adults are discussed and are especially important as the number of biracial individuals in the United States continues to increase. Areas for future research are also described.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Although multiracial youth represent a growing segment of children in all American families, we have little information on their well-being within single-mother households. This article examines multiracial children's level of poverty within single-mother families to identify the degree to which they may stand out from their monoracial peers. Using data from the 2006-2008 American Community Survey (3-year estimates), we explore the level of racial disparities in child poverty between monoracial White children and monoracial and multiracial children of color. Fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses (n = 359,588) reveal that nearly all children of color are more likely to be poor than White children. Yet many multiracial children appear to hold an in-between status in which they experience lower rates of poverty than monoracial children of color. The high level of variation across groups suggests that the relationship between race and childhood poverty is more complicated than generally presumed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","This study estimates the prevalence of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use in a nationally representative sample of monoracial/ethnic and biracial/ethnic youth and young adults. The authors consider 16 racial/ethnic categories and used four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The analysis sample consists of 20,745 individuals in Wave 1. The primary statistical methodology used in the present study is logistic regression with sample weights. Findings suggest that participants who self-report two races/ethnicities have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates. For example, Black-American Indians reported cigarette smoking rates that were significantly lower than rates reported by American Indians but significantly higher than rates reported by Blacks. Groups with the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking at Wave 1 were American Indian, White-American Indian, White, and Multiracial (people reporting three or more races/ethnicities). Groups with the highest prevalence of alcohol drinking at Wave 1 were White-American Indian, Multiracial, Hispanic, White, and White-Hispanic. Groups with the highest prevalence of marijuana smoking at Wave 1 were Black-Asian and American Indian. The authors found an interaction effect between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Lower-class SES status may serve as a risk factor for biracial/ethnic adolescents while upper-class SES may serve as a protective factor for these youth. In general, biracial/ethnic individuals have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates.

In-depth interviews and focus groups reveal that participants identify biracially as ""Blaxican."" Participants reject monoraciality and the common sense way of defining Blackness as defined by the one-drop rule of hypodescent. Participants are either bicultural or monocultural dependent whether they were raised in single parent vis-a-vis co-parenting households. The authentic expression of Blaxicanness is to identify as biracial and have a bicultural identity, therefore those that are monocultural work to incorporate both cultures into their identities. Parental socialization, peer groups, school and neighborhood contexts are the main socializing agents that shape Blaxican identities. I find that Blaxicans live in a borderlands space in between the social constructions of Black and Chicana/o identities. Black and Chicana/o peers police the boundaries around ""authentic"" half-Black and half-Mexican identity forcing Blaxicans to the borderlands where ambiguity, and contradictions are embraced. Blaxicans experience monoracial microaggressions (Nadal et al. 2011) that signal their non-normative, marginal and second-class citizen status.

Peer Reviewed Journal","We know that early experience plays a crucial role in the development of face processing, but we know little about how infants learn to distinguish faces from different races, especially for non-Caucasian populations. Moreover, it is unknown whether differential processing of different race faces observed in typically studied monoracial infants extends to biracial infants as well. Thus, we investigated 3-month-old Caucasian, Asian and biracial (Caucasian-Asian) infants' ability to distinguish Caucasian and Asian faces. Infants completed two within-subject, infant-controlled habituation sequences and test trials as an eye tracker recorded looking times and scanning patterns. Examination of individual differences revealed significant positive correlations between own-race novelty preference and scanning frequency between eye and mouth regions of own-race habituation stimuli for Caucasian and Asian infants, suggesting that facility in own-race face discrimination stems from active inspection of internal facial features in these groups. Biracial infants, however, showed the opposite effect: An 'own-race' novelty preference was associated with reduced scanning between eye and mouth regions of 'own-race' habituation stimuli, suggesting that biracial infants use a distinct approach to processing frequently encountered faces. Future directions for investigating face processing development in biracial populations are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Previous research has demonstrated that an early attentional component of the event-related potential (ERP), the P2, is sensitive to the distinction between the processing of racial outgroup and ingroup faces but may not be sensitive to the distinction between racially ambiguous and ingroup faces. Recent behavioral work, however, has suggested that contextual information may affect the processing of racially ambiguous faces. Thus, the first goal of this study was to examine whether the early neural processing of racially ambiguous faces would be affected by primed stereotypes. White college student participants (n = 29) completed a task in which they racially categorized monoracial Black and White faces and racially ambiguous Black-White morphs. These faces were preceded by positive and negative Black and White stereotypical primes. Results indicated that P2 amplitude to the racially ambiguous faces was moderated by the valence of the primes such that negative primes led to greater neural processing of the racially ambiguous faces than positive primes. Furthermore, the extent to which P2 amplitude was affected by prime valence was moderated by individual differences in preference for structure and categorical thinking, as well as comfort with ambiguity.

As the push to acknowledge, express and celebrate multiracial identities intensifies, the ontological status, meaning of multiracial identities and their relationship to monoracial identities is of increasing importance to our understanding of race relations in both countries. The dilemma that philosophers of race are confronted with is how to identify those persons impacted by racisms without reifying the concept of race and/or falling foul of presenting essentialized group categories. Models that seek to grapple with these ethical problems are typically, if not surprisingly, undergirded by an unencumbered liberal framework that prioritises freedom and equality. The unencumbered conception of the self is historically, socially and morally disconnected such that one's identity can be separated from one.s values. However, I argue that there is a racial consciousness that constitutes social reality in the United States and Britain and impacts the lived experience. This renders unencumbered models of moral reasoning untenable. Rejecting the unencumbered self, I consider multiracial identity from an encumbered ontological perspective, which posits the evaluation and articulation of identity as constitutive of the self and social reality. This model requires us to address the moral content of racial identities imbedded in the racial consciousness and allows us to consider racial identities, not as proxies for moral commitments but rather as part of a multi-layered process in which a person's racial identity is both a reflection of and a significant factor in shaping a person's moral commitments. In light of this, I explore a selection of models of collective responsibility. I claim that in a society with racial consciousness, collective responsibility is best described and understood within the framework of an encumbered conception of the self. Ultimately, I contend that if we are to tackle racial injustice, we must revisit our understanding of moral reasoning as rational, objective and fundamentally unencumbered.

Vol.72(11-A),2012, pp. 4056.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"This dissertation investigates racial complexities in higher education through three distinct papers in which I centralize critical pedagogy, leadership development, and organizational change through the lens of multiracial subject theory. Chapter one considers the merits, strategies and limitations of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Critical Whiteness Studies (CWS) as pedagogical tools in higher education contexts. I demonstrate the ways in which monoracial foundations are imbedded in these two approaches and argue that, through a mixed-race analytic, theorists working in the field of CRT and CWS will be better able to analyze the dynamic interplay of race and racial categorizations in ways that benefit a broad spectrum of diverse students, including a growing multiracial student population. Building on this platform, chapter two highlights research data from a two-year qualitative case study in which one undergraduate group of ten multiracial students initiated, designed and implemented a college course. Here, I argue that these students developed a critical mixed race praxis through intentional, shared leadership, interdisciplinary content, and regular attention to a larger political agenda. Throughout the paper, I consider two central themes: (1) implications of a shared leadership model on college student development, and (2) practical lessons far organizational interventions in higher education pedagogy. The third paper shifts from student development to that of higher education administrators who seek to build organizational capacity for justice-conscious leadership. Building on the theoretical and empirical data in the previous papers, chapter three articulates a set of criteria by which to define and measure critical mixed race praxes. Through a series of vignettes located in higher education contexts, I highlight timely moments and opportunities for administrators to leverage their multiple subject positions in ways that inform and contribute to critical leadership practices. My analysis cautions against leadership and policy that rely on fixed identity politics to instead emphasize structural and organizational models as methodological tools for praxis.

The present study was the first overall exploration of the experiences of this population. A qualitative approach, specifically Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), was used to investigate the experiences of multiracial late adolescents/young adults. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 participants between the ages of 19 and 25 to examine their experiences in different areas of their lives such as general experiences as a multiracial person, personal identification and identification by others. It also explored the influence of racial identity development, the experience of being multiracial in relation to attitudes/practices, the likes and challenges of being multiracial and advice from the multiracial perspective. IPA was used to extract 20 major themes which were placed in 3 domains: the effects of oppression on the community, the intersection of systemic perceptions of multiracial late adolescents/young adults, and experiences of multiracial identity. The domains and themes are discussed in connection with the current literature as well as clinical implications and future research for this population. The outcome of this study emphasizes the effects of oppression on the community, family and the multiracial individual. Participants report how the long lasting effects of colonization and slavery have left them in position where they are judged because of their phenotype, their mixed racial background, and their behavior if different from the stereotype of a specific monoracial group. They are often classified as monoracial by others due to phenotype or because others must place them into a category regardless of their mixed heritage. However, the majority of participants claimed a private and public multiracial identity. Overall, multiracial identity has allowed participants to be more open and tolerant of others' realities and it has influenced their course of education and/or future career goals in a positive way. Finally, participants advise parents of multiracial children to educate and expose their children to all of the races/cultures in their background in order to help them develop a healthy identity. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","What factors determine whether mixed-race individuals claim a biracial identity or a monoracial identity? Two studies examine how two status-related factors-race and social class-influence identity choice. While a majority of mixed-race participants identified as biracial in both studies, those who were members of groups with higher status in American society were more likely than those who were members of groups with lower status to claim a biracial identity. Specifically, (a) Asian/White individuals were more likely than Black/White or Latino/White individuals to identify as biracial and (b) mixed-race people from middle-class backgrounds were more likely than those from working-class backgrounds to identify as biracial. These results suggest that claiming a biracial identity is a choice that is more available to those with higher status.

We found support for these hypotheses across six experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrated that perceivers did not categorize morphed Black-White faces as Multiracial with the same frequency with which they categorized Black and White faces as Black and White (respectively), and that categorizations of multiracials as Multiracial took longer than monoracial categorizations. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these effects to real Black-White faces. Experiment 3 showed that these findings generalized to Asian-White faces. We used pixel variance analysis to show that these effects were not due to increased variance among Multiracial faces. The image analysis showed that the Black-White morphs and real biracials were actually less varied than either the Black or White sets of faces. Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrated that cognitive load and time constraints detrimentally affected multiracial, but not monoracial, categorizations. Experiment 6 showed that imbuing monoracial categories with importance decreases the use of the Multiracial category. Implications of these findings for understanding perceptions of multiracial persons are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Transracial adoption [TRA], particularly the adoption of black children by white parents, has been a controversial issue in the United States for more than half a century. Much of the criticism surrounding transracial adoption has dealt with concerns that black children raised in white homes will fail to develop a positive black identity. Such critiques are often based on assumptions about the identity of black children raised by their biological parents, yet studies of transracial adoption rarely address identity development struggles experienced by black children raised in black homes. Moreover, while the race of parents in relation to children is at the center of the transracial adoption debate, TRA studies rarely delve into socialization practices of biracial families headed by one white and one black parent. This study addresses a void in the literature by examining the experiences of young black adults whose parents may or may not be of the same race. The impact of varying racialized family structures on black identity development is examined by comparing the experiences of young black adults raised in families with two black parents (monoracial), one white and one black parent (biracial), and two white parents (transracial). Drawing from 32 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with middle-class young black adults between the ages of 18 and 30 years old, findings indicate that all informants, regardless of racialized family structure, approach racial identity development similarly by de-emphasizing the ascribed status of race in favor of achieved statuses as part of the identity construction process.

Using an interdisciplinary and mixed methods research approach, I investigate the shifting and contested ways the multiracial population is defined in public and private discourses, paying particular attention to the complexities this community raises within and among monoracial identified communities. Examining the multiracial population in the U.S. has a significant and critical place in the larger trajectory of social scientific scholarship on race, gender, class, and other intersecting identities. This body of research counters the argument that multiple identity formation is inconsequential to theory, civic engagement, and socio-political participation in a contemporary society. This study urges scholars to (re)examine how race and ethnicity continues to be framed, analyzed, interrogated, and understood in ways that are restricted by historically racist/racialized moments that still linger today. These moments, I argue, are sharpened and more pronounced when centering the politics of what it means to claim a multiracial identity in America in the twenty-first century. The theoretical model for this study was Grounded Theory. Principle data collection methods were the ""insider-outsider"" and case study research approaches using extensive face-to-face audio and/or photographed interviews; participant and field observations of key local, state, and national events, including U.S. Census proceedings and California Senate Judiciary hearings; and content analysis of primary and secondary documents, including media coverage and organizational archives. Data was collected between 2004 and 2009 in Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, New York, and Sacramento. These cities exhibited the most heightened multiracial activity across the country in this timeframe. I also investigated exclusive, never before documented, behind the scenes initiatives to recognize the unmet needs of this emerging population through an in-depth case study of the Association of MultiEthnic Americans (AMEA)-one of the oldest leading national advocacy organizations for multiracial, multiethnic, and transracially adopted individuals, families, organizations, and allies.

Peer Reviewed Journal","We use incidence data from the 1980 Census and 2008 American Community Survey to track recent trends in interracial marriage. Intermarriage with Whites increased rapidly among Blacks but stalled among Asians and American Indians. Black-White intermarriage increased threefold over 1980-2008, independent of changing socioeconomic status, suggesting declining social distance between Blacks and Whites. Marriages between the U.S.- and foreign-born populations also grew rapidly. Marriages to immigrants increased fivefold among U.S.-born Asian women and doubled among U.S.-born Latinas since 1980. Out-marriage to Whites also was higher among self-identified biracial than monoracial individuals, but these differences were smallest among Blacks. Interracial couples were overrepresented among cohabiting couples. Finally, log-linear models provide evidence of growing racial exogamy, but only after adjusting for changing demographic opportunities for intermarriage. Marriages between U.S.- and foreign-born coethnics have been driven by new immigration while slowing the upward trajectory of interracial marriage in America.

The purpose of this study was to investigate how the ethnic identity statuses were related to relationship with God and Korean language proficiency among Korean American Christian college students. The sample of this study was 322 participants composed of 158 males (49.1%) and 165 females (50.1%) and their range of age was 18-30 years (M=20.14) from 12 churches of three Protestant Presbyterian denominations (KAPC, KPCA, and PCA) in Southern California. In the survey questionnaire, Multi Ethnic Identity Measure Revised (MEIMR, 12 items) assessed ethnic identity, Spiritual Assessment Inventory (SAI, 53 items) measured relationship with God, and General Ethnic Questionnaire-Korean (GEQK, 15 items) assessed the Korean language proficiency. The data were analyzed with t-test, ANOVA, MANOVA, and Correlation coefficient. Data analysis found that the high level students of Korean language proficiency scored higher on ethnic identity formation than the middle level students and the low level students of Korean language proficiency students. Large effect size was found (effect size =.16) and there were great differences on ethnic identity between three groups of Korean language proficiency levels. Based on these findings, this study suggested implications for ministry practices. First, Korean American church leaders can help students develop ethnic identity through making church as a community to learn and experience ethnicity and cultural values. Second, Korean American college ministers might develop a context of grace. Ministers might emphasize Christian new identity and ethnic identity at the same time rather than ethnic elements only. In addition to monoracial circumstances, in multiethnic churches, ministers could give church members clear directions for church missions, values, and methods to accomplish common goals of the church. In this unity, church members might acknowledge and honor the diversity of ethnic elements such as culture and ethnic language. Ministers might encourage members to develop their ethnic and cultural values effectively.

Peer Reviewed Journal","In May of 2008 the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute issued a report that questioned whether or not transracial adoption is truly in the best interest of the child, thus newly igniting the controversy over transracial adoption. While the research on this controversial topic is substantial, most studies (including those cited in the Donaldson Report) are limited in their scope. Drawing from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with middle-class young black adults, this study offers a broader perspective on transracial adoption by focusing on a range of parent/child race relationships in a class context. The impact of racialized family structure on black identity development is examined by comparing the experiences of young black adults raised in families with two black parents (monoracial), one white and one black parent (biracial), and two white parents (transracial). This article also addresses a void in the literature by focusing on the impact socioeconomic class has on identity formation, particularly middle-class black identity. Results indicate that the formative experiences of young black adults who differ in terms of racialized family structure but share a class status are largely similar. These similarities challenge a number of assumptions that have been made in prior transracial adoption research.

Peer Reviewed Journal","This article explores the racial/ethnic identities of multiracial Black-Mexicans or ""Blaxicans."" In-depth interviews with 12 Blaxican individuals in California reveal how they negotiate distinct cultural systems to accomplish multiracial identities. I argue that choosing, accomplishing, and asserting a Blaxican identity challenges the dominant monoracial discourse in the United States, in particular among African American and Chicana/o communities. That is, Blaxican respondents are held accountable by African Americans and Chicanas/os/Mexicans to monoracial notions of ""authenticity."" The process whereby Blaxicans move between these monoracial spaces to create multiracial identities illustrates crucial aspects of the social construction of race/ethnicity in the United States and the influence of social interactions in shaping how Blaxicans develop their multiracial identities.

Results from the principal components analysis using data from a web-based sample of 185 multiracial individuals with Asian and White descent yielded a five-factor simple structure of the Biracial Experiences of Discrimination Inventory (B-REDI): Biracial Response to Monoracial Context (6 items), Racial Microaggressions (6 items), Confusion of Interracial Family Relations (4 items), Assumptions of Marginality (3 items), and Internalized Multiracial Racism (3 items). Initial evidences of internal reliability, convergent validity and known-groups validity were found. An evaluation of internal consistency suggested that the B-REDI reflected dimensions of multiracial racism and supported initial evidence of the reliability of the five factors that emerged. In support of convergent validity, multiracial experiences of discrimination were positively correlated with perceived general ethnic discrimination, Asian American racism-related stress, a universal-diverse orientation, awareness and acceptance of others similarities and differences, as well as awareness, sensitivity, and receptivity towards racial diversity and multiculturalism. Also in support of convergent validity, multiracial experiences of racism were negatively correlated with colorblind racial attitudes. Evidence for known-groups validity was demonstrated through statistically significantly higher levels of multiracial experiences reported among multiracial individuals with Asian and White descent (n = 184) than monoracial individuals (n = 325). However, multiracial individuals with Asian and White descent (n = 184) did not report multiracial experiences of racism at a statistically significantly higher level when compared to multiracial individuals of other ethnic backgrounds (n = 263). This finding suggests that having a mixed race background may represent a factor that exerts an overall greater impact compared to the specific ethnic group make-up of an individual. Study limitations as well as research and clinical implications are discussed.

However, there is little empirical investigation into the educational needs of multiracials. The current project addressed this gap by utilizing quantitative survey and qualitative interview data from a recently conducted national study to explore the perceptions of multiracial undergraduate and graduate students within psychology. The focus of the current study was the comparison of Asian American/European American and Latino/a/European American multiracial students to their single heritage counterparts on several variables of interest - academic supports and barriers; linkage between barriers faced and ethnicity; perceived cultural diversity; and perceptions of the extent of cultural diversity related to satisfaction. Furthermore, exploratory differences in these variables related to multiracial self-identification and the variables of satisfaction, specialness and representation in psychology were examined. Both multiracial groups reported more of a link between academic barriers experienced and their ethnicity than European American students, but less of a link than their monoracial minority peers. Also, both multiracial groups were more likely to report that their ethnic group was not represented in psychology than fairly represented, compared to European American peers, but less likely to report this compared to their monoracial minority counterparts. The same pattern of findings existed for student's perceptions that psychology had something special to offer their ethnic group. In other cases, differences were not found between the multiracial groups and their monoracial counterparts, or between the two multiracial groups.

This study identified protective factors promoting resilience in the development of positive self-identity in biracial youths. The rapidly rising biracial youth population is a vulnerable group facing potentially higher risks for mental health and behavioral issues compared to their monoracial counterparts. Identity development, a central psychosocial task of adolescence, is a complex task for biracial youths since they must integrate two ethnic identities. For biracial youths, mastery of the psychosocial identity developmental task can be daunting as they face stressors such as racial stigmas and negative stereotypes, which may lead to identity problems manifesting during adolescence. Sixteen biracial individuals ranging from age 18 to 29 years participated in this qualitative research project. Comparisons were made to identify patterns and themes for factors affecting self-esteem and ethnic identity level among the participants. Brought to light were culturally-based protective factors stemming from individual, family, and social domains promoting psychosocial resilience in fostering healthy biracial identity resolution. Risk factors unique for the biracial population were also identified. The findings underscore the importance in understanding how the environment shapes and influences the ways biracial youth negotiate their dual identity. The research results can be integrated into appropriate prevention and intervention techniques for application by professionals and families to further healthy identity resolution in biracial youths.

Vol.71(9-A),2011, pp. 3436.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"This dissertation examines how parents experience raising multiracial and multiethnic children. It is part heuristic, part narrative inquiry, examining the author's own story as a parent of a multiracial and multiethnic child and comparing it with the personal stories of parents of other multiethnic and multiracial children. The participants in this study were all biological or step parents of multiracial and multiethnic children. There were 8 people interviewed, plus 1 heuristic participant; they represented 6 families. Including the heuristic participant, they were the parents of 17 children. In this study, the primary research question was: how do parents experience raising multiracial and multiethnic children? During the review of the literature, research showed that many parents of children of color raise their children using identity competencies and particular parenting skills. In chapter 3, a conceptual framework was proposed in which parents of multiracial and multiethnic children used a combination of identity competencies and parenting skills to help their children interface with the outside world. An interview protocol was developed to test this conceptual framework. Interviews of 8 parents and 1 heuristic inquiry were written as narratives in chapter 4. A thematic presentation examining the common themes among the narratives and heuristic inquiry was offered at the end of chapter 4. Ultimately, the researcher determined that parents of multiracial and multiethnic children do use identity competencies and parenting skills when raising their children. However, the conceptual framework, while useful, also presented limitations. Thus, a revised conceptual framework emerged. In the revised framework, parents of multiracial and multiethnic children prepare their children for interactions with the world by focusing on developing: (a) identity competencies, (b) specific parenting skills, (c) language choices, (d) relationships with grandparents or extended families, and (e) their own and their children's religion. Recommendations for parenting multiracial and multiethnic children as well as parenting monoracial and monoethnic children are offered at the end of chapter 5. In addition, implications for leadership and social justice are developed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","How are the lives of middle-class third-generation Mexican Americans both racialized and gendered? Third-generation Mexican Americans in California experience a racialization process continuum that extends from ""flexible ethnicity,"" the ability to be considered an ""insider"" in different racial/ ethnic communities, to racialization as nonwhite that is enforced through the deployment of negative stereotypes. Using interview data, the author finds that women are afforded more ""flexible ethnicity"" than men. Accordingly, men are more rigorously racialized than women. Women are racialized through exoticization, whereas men are racialized as threats to safety. Lighter-skinned individuals escaped consistent racialization. These findings have consequences for the incorporation possibilities of later-generation Mexican Americans, as women and light-skinned (often multiracial) individuals are more frequently granted ""flexible ethnicity"" and less strongly racialized than men and dark-skinned (often monoracial) individuals. Even among the structurally assimilated, contemporary racial and gender hierarchies limit the voluntary quality of ethnicity among third-generation Mexican Americans.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Drawing on interview data with black-white biracial adults, we examine the considerable agency most have in asserting their racial identities to others. Extending research on ""identity work"" (Snow and Anderson 1987), we explore the strategies biracial people use to conceal (i.e., pass), cover, and/or accent aspects of their racial ancestries, and the individual and structural-level factors that limit the accessibility and/or effectiveness of some strategies. We further find that how these biracial respondents identify is often contextual-most identify as biracial, but in some contexts, they pass as monoracial. Scholars argue that passing may be a relic of the past, yet we find that passing still occurs today. Most notably, we find a striking reverse pattern of passing today-while passing during the Jim Crow era involved passing as white, these respondents more often report passing as black today. Motivations for identity work are explored, with an emphasis on passing as black.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Although race is one of the most salient status characteristics in American society, many observers cannot distinguish the racial ancestries of multiracial youth. This paper examines how people perceive multiracial adolescents: specifically, I investigate whether observers perceive the adolescents as multiracial and whether these racial perceptions are congruent with the multiracial adolescents' self-identifications. Results show that 1) observers perceived close to half of multiracial targets as monoracial, 2) multiracial targets who identified themselves as black were nearly always perceived as black but not always as multiracial, and 3) the demographic and environmental characteristics of observers had no bearing on the congruence of their racial perceptions. That is, regardless of their own demographic characteristics or exposure to people of other races, observers were more congruent when examining targets who self-identified as black or white and less congruent when identifying targets from Asian, Hispanic, American Indian, or Middle Eastern backgrounds. Despite the demographic trend toward multiracialism in the United States, observers' perceptions may maintain the status quo in race relations: a black-white dichotomy where part-blacks remain in the collective black category.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The present research capitalized on the prominence and multiracial heritage of U.S. 2008 presidential election candidate Barack Obama to examine whether individual differences in classifying him as Black or as multiracial corresponded to differences in implicit perception of race. This research used a newly developed task (Sedlins, Malahy, & Shoda, 2010) with digitally morphed mixed-race faces to assess implicit race perception. Participants completed this task four times before and one time after the election. We found that people who labeled Obama as Black implicitly perceived race as more categorical than those who labeled Obama as multiracial. This finding adds to the growing literature on multiracial perception by demonstrating a relationship between the explicit use of multiracial and monoracial race classification and implicit race perception. The results suggest potential implications for governmental, educational, and judiciary usage of racial categories.

Peer Reviewed Journal","For multiracial adolescents, forming a sense of self and identity can be complicated, even at the level of classifying themselves in terms of racial group membership. Using a Race Self Complexity (Winston et al., 2004) theoretical framework, this study used an open-ended question to examine the racial self-identification fluidity of 66 adolescents during the 7th, 8th, and 11th grades. This sample included 22 Black/White multiracial adolescents, as well as a matched sample of 22 Black and 22 White adolescents. Seventy-three percent of the multiracial adolescents changed their racial self-identification in the form of two time change patterns with a number of consolidating and differentiating racial self-identification variations. There was no change for the monoracial adolescents. These results suggest that within the lives of multiracial adolescents, the process of racial self-identification may be a personality characteristic adaptation to the meaning of race in American society that may change across time, place, and role.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Existing studies indicate that multiracial adolescents face greater substance use rates than monoracial adolescents. However, it is unclear whether the risk identified in adolescence persists into adulthood. The current study uses data from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey to analyze the alcohol and tobacco use of multiracial adolescents and adults compared to European American, African American, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander American, and Latino American individuals. Results generally support the hypothesis that multiracial adolescents and adults face higher rates of substance use than African American and Asian/Pacific Islander American individuals, though this pattern of results was reversed in comparison with Native Americans and European Americans, and less consistent compared to Latino Americans. We further establish and discuss the correlates of drinking and smoking behavior for mixed-race individuals-comparing them to other racial groups. We review the limitations of our design and the implications for future research on multiracial substance use.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The growing prominence of the multiracial population in the United States is prompting new questions about attitudes toward multiracial people and popular opinion of policies designed to protect them from discrimination. Currently, American anti-discrimination policies are directed at groups who identify with a single race, but the rising profile of multiracial groups introduces new complexity into questions about racial policy. In this study, we find generally positive affect toward multiracial people, although monoracial minorities are more positive toward multiracial people than whites are. About half of the monoracial minorities and the majority of whites oppose including multiracial people in anti-discrimination policies. Attitudes are associated with traditional predictors such as education and political beliefs, and also with the racial heterogeneity of the local context and intimate contact with other racial groups. Although multiracial people report experiencing discrimination at levels similar to those of monoracial minorities, our results suggest there may be significant resistance to anti-discrimination policies that include multiracial groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal","This study attempted to compare life adjustment of adolescents from mix-heritage (one parent from Southeast Asian countries) and single-heritage families. It also investigated factors associated with problems in adjustment of adolescents from new immigrant families in their academic and social lives, including educational performance, peer relationship, psychological and behavioral problems from the theoretical perspectives of identity formation and symbolic interaction, factors associated with the of adolescents from new immigrant families. Using the multi-stage cluster sampling method, 884 adolescents aged 12 to 16 participated in this study. Three hundred and ninety-one were biracial (44.2%) and 493 were monoracial (55.8%). No difference was found between groups in all measures of life adjustment. Path analyses indicated that relationships between the proposed explanatory variables and life adjustment were not quite the same for the two groups of adolescents. However, minority racial identity and perceived racial discrimination predicted the life adjustment of adolescents from new immigrant families. Minority racial identity had both direct and indirect effects on psychological and behavioral adjustment, but had indirect effects on educational performance and peer relationship. Perceived racial discrimination only had indirect effects on life adjustment via self-esteem.

Vol.70(12-A),2010, pp. 4867.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"Research about the school lives of mixed-race youth in the United States has been limited to the academic outcomes of test scores, grades, and grade repetition of multiracial students who claim some White heritage. Non-White multiracial students have been ignored. The relevant past studies have rejected the ""marginal man"" theory as an explanation for the academic outcomes of multiracial students, but have not proposed an alternative framework. This dissertation examines three school-related domains: academic performance and its presumed causes, peer attitudes about school and schoolwork, and students' connections to school. It includes non-White mixed-race students and tests a theory of enhanced access rather than marginalization. The starting assumption is that, compared to their monoracial peers, multiracial students will have access to resources from each group in their heritage, resulting in different outcomes in their school lives. Using survey data from a national sample of 29,621 single-race and 2,122 mixed-race students in grades 7 through 11, I first contrasted eight groups of students, four monoracial (Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White) and four multiracial (Asian-White, Black-Hispanic, Black-White, and Hispanic-White). On the academic measures, the part-White biracial students often did better than the monoracial students from the non-White group in their heritage and the non-White multiracial students. However, on the peer attitude and school connection variables, the racial groups were more similar. When socio-economic home resource and parental factors were added to the model, many of the academic differences between part-White students and monoracial students from their non-White background group were reduced or eliminated, as were differences between White and non-White monoracial students. These socio-economic factors had little effect on racial comparisons on the peer attitude and school connection variables. Thus, the academic ""advantage"" of whiteness observed for part-White multiracial students and White monoracial students was at least partially attributable to school-relevant resources accessible to them through their home environments. On homework measures, whiteness was a disadvantage for Asian-White students associated with doing less homework than their Asian peers. The relative academic success of Asian students appeared to be linked not to class but to doing homework.

President Obama's self-claimed identity reinforced this image. Many of the laws and ways of classifying people changed since President Obama's generation and with these changes arose a growing population of people with one White parent and one Black parent. This group claimed neither a Black nor White identity, but rather a biracial identity. ""Biracial is not currently a recognized racial category within the American cultural landscape"" (Rockquemore & Brunsma, 2002, p. 336). According to Root (1996), ""The US Census (1992) reported that while the number of monoracial white babies was 15%, the number of Black/White biracial babies has grown almost 500%"" (p. xv). For the first time in history, the number of biracial babies is increasing at a faster rate than the number of monoracial babies (p. xiv). Root (1996) referred to this phenomenon as the biracial baby boom (Root, 1996, p. xv). This qualitative naturalistic inquiry study described the experiences of six interracial couples raising biracial children. The interracial couples consisted of Black men married to White women. The source of information for this study came from individual audio-recorded face-to-face interviews from the 12 participants. The interviews were transcribed, verified by the participants, and analyzed by the researcher and a peer debriefer for themes. Themes of the six interracial couple's experiences emerged. The overall consensus of the respondents was that society has not changed significantly during the past 10 years. The participants are still experiencing discrimination, racism, negative classification, social rejection, marginalization, negative stereotypes, exclusion, and ignorance from the members and practices of society. Most of the participants' experienced their children being excluded, marginalized, and forgotten at school, and shared situations of condemnation, name calling, and racist remarks. At parent conferences, practices of not having eye contact with the Black father and directing communication toward the White mother were reported. The participants in this study voiced concern about teachers, principals, and administrators lacking knowledge in regard to the teaching of biracial students. Respondents stated that teachers had low expectations of biracial students and used low-level curriculum.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The number of interracial couples in the U.S. is growing, but they often receive little support. Although previous studies have explored the relationship between low social support and decreased relationship satisfaction in interracial couples, there are few studies on intimate partner violence (IPV) in these couples. To better understand IPV in interracial couples compared to monoracial couples, all police-reported IPV events across a municipality were examined. Odds ratios showed differences between interracial and ethnic minority monoracial couples. Interracial couples were more likely to have a history of prior IPV (OR = 2.60), engage in mutual assault (OR = 2.36), and result in perpetrator arrest (OR = 1.71) than ethnic minority monoracial couples. Victims of IPV in interracial couples were also more likely to be injured (OR = 1.37). There were no significant differences between the couples in terms of substance use or children present during the IPV event. Differences between IPV in interracial and White couples also emerged. Interracial couples were more likely to have children present (OR = 1.84), to have a prior report (OR = 1.98), to result in victim injury (OR = 1.73), and to result in perpetrator arrest than White couples (OR = 2.18). Interracial couples were more likely to engage in mutual assault than White couples (OR = 2.94). However, interracial couples were about 50% less likely than White couples to use drugs or alcohol before or during the IPV event. Research is needed to better understand the unique challenges and needs faced by interracial couples to help them sustain healthy partnerships.

Venzant Chambers (International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, 2010[Jun], Vol 23[3], 259-281). In the original article, estimates from the 2006 Census included in the first paragraph of the Background section on p. 260 are incorrect. The sentence: 'More recent estimates from the 2006 Census indicate that approximately one-quarter of the populations of Alabama, California, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina and an estimated one-third of the populations of Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and South Carolina identify as multiracial (Stuckey 2008)' should be disregarded. The online article and map (Stuckey 2008) that we cite once indicated that one-quarter of California identifies as multiracial, but now specifies the number as at around 2%. Similarly, according to the updated article, the multiracial population of the USA seems to have fallen from 2.5% of the total population to 1.6%. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2010-08153-002). Despite the increasing interest in the experiences of multiracial individuals, as evidenced by the emergent body of literature and research related to multiracial experiences, we lack an understanding of methodological concerns related to research with multiracial individuals. Here, we seek to (1) investigate the applicability of theories of insider/outsider status to research conducted by and with multiracial individuals, (2) interrogate our own research experiences as multiracial scholars conducting research with multiracial students, and (3) identify implications from our analysis for other researchers. We conclude that understandings of methodological terms related to monoracial populations are limited in their applicability to research with multiracial individuals. Additionally, we conclude that navigating multiracial identities in research situations is a particularly complicated process aided less by a shared sense of identity or community between researcher and participants and more by experiences that stem from a similar need to engage in micronegotiations of racial and ethnic identities.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Despite extensive research on multiracial youth in recent years, to date, no empirical studies have analyzed how racial context may affect biracial adolescents' sense of belonging in a social institution beyond families. In this study, we examine how the racial makeup of the student body affects self-identified biracial adolescents' school attachment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that the proportions of white or black students in school significantly affect the school attachment of Hispanic/black, Asian/black, and American Indian/black biracial adolescents, but school racial composition in general has little influence on biracial adolescents with a partial-white identification (i.e., black/white, Hispanic/white, Asian/white, and American Indian/white). Our analyses also show that on average, students of most biracial groups display lower school attachment than their corresponding monoracial groups, but the differences from the monoracial groups with the lower school attachment are generally small. We discuss the implications of our findings for biracial adolescents' perceived racial boundaries and contemporary American race relations.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Are biracial people perceived more negatively than their monoracial counterparts? Across two studies, we compared ratings of warmth, competence, and minority scholarship worthiness for biracial (Study 1: Black/White, Study 2: Asian/White), White, and minority (Study 1: Black, Study 2: Asian) college applicants. Findings suggest that both biracial applicants were perceived as colder and sometimes less competent than both White and corresponding minority applicants. Moreover, biracial people were also perceived as less qualified for minority scholarships than other racial minorities, which is partially explained by penalties to warmth and competence. Study 3 shows that disclosing one's biracial identity makes biracial people vulnerable to negative feedback. Taken together, these studies suggest that biracial people who disclose their biracial identity experience bias from perceivers and may be more vulnerable to that bias because of the personal nature of racial disclosure. Findings are discussed considering the stereotype content model (Cuddy, Fiske, & Glick, 2007), cultural stereotypes about biracial people (Jackman, Wagner, & Johnson, 2001), and the costs of disclosing devalued identities.

Peer Reviewed Journal","This study examined predictors of substance use and negative activity involvement among a diverse sample of European American, African American, Hispanic, Native American, and multiracial early adolescents (n = 749) living in a large urban city in the Southwest United States. This study investigated a broad set of predictor variables that tap sociodemographic, peer, family, community, and school influences. Overall, findings from this study confirm that lifetime substance use remains high among youth of color. Of particular concern is this study's finding that multiracial adolescents are at elevated risk to use substances and engage in negative activities. The implications of this study for understanding how risk factors are influenced by race and other variables on different measures of problem behavior are discussed.

Edited Book","(from the chapter) This chapter examines interactions with strangers in public places, another way in which the hegemonic American Family shapes lived experiences in diverse family forms. When in public, families are on display. When they challenge conventional norms, families are especially open to unsolicited attention from strangers-to questions, stares, even violence; when they appear congruent with those norms, families receive less intrusive attention. In either case, monitoring occurs. This chapter examines how interpretations of ""race"" and ""the family"" result in particular types of public interactions for adoptive families, and how those experiences differ for families raising children adopted from China and from Russia. This chapter, then, compares the experiences of families who adopt from Russia and those who adopt from China. My analysis is based on the contrasting themes regarding race and biological kinship found between these two groups in their public interactions and interpretations of those experiences. In 2002 and 2003, I conducted in-depth interviews with forty mothers and six of their husbands who live in New England and adopted their children internationally from China and Russia. The women and men who spoke with me adopted their children as infants or toddlers (from the ages of five months to three years). The children, having been in their present families for a minimum of two years, were between the ages of four and twelve when I spoke with their parents. The noted differences regarding surveillance among families with children from China and those with children from Russia bring into focus the important ways in which people are always evaluating other families and expecting others to adhere to a specific set of ideals; these differences illustrate as well the ways in which individuals negotiate those expectations. In addition, the differing race-based experiences of the adoptive families in my sample point to the idea that rather than a zero-sum game, with the privileged American Family on one side and everyone else on the other, the idealized family (and its accompanying privileges) can be seen to fall on a continuum with a range of norms regarding culturally appropriate family forms and behavior. This continuum perspective can be seen in the range of responses to families who fall outside of the idealized American Family. Visibly international adoptive families (or those who disclose their status) are objectified as interesting curiosities by usually well-meaning but prying strangers, but they are not vilified or discredited as are some other ""nontraditional"" families. This surveillance does not result in structural discrimination or physical intimidation. Rather, interracial surveillance and the loss of biological privilege challenge the privacy and integrity of these families that are afforded to biological, monoracial ones. The loss of privilege experienced by these families is therefore largely symbolic. However, as Goffman's work on stigma (1963) emphasized, the symbolic loss of normativity is not inconsequential. It is deeply experienced and can have material as well as social and psychological impacts.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The study presented here tested three theories of racial differences in academic performance among monoracial and multiracial high school students. These theories (status attainment, oppositional culture, and educational attitudes) were developed to explain differences in achievement among monoracial groups, but the study tested how the theories apply to a multiracial sample. The results show that ethnic identity and experiences of ethnic discrimination are not strong factors in explaining academic performance among multiracial or monoracial students. Instead, the grades of multiracial students are related to their concrete beliefs about the consequences of school failure, the educational values of their peers, and the racial composition of their neighborhoods and schools. Additional descriptive statistics found that multiracial students who self-identify as black or Hispanic achieve lower grades than do those who self-identify as white or Asian. The author suggests a transracial theory of academic performance that considers the effects of contexts.

Identification choice was defined using an adult-based identity typology (Brunsma & Rockquemore, 2001): (a) consistently monoracial (singular), (b) consistently multiracial (border), or (c) inconsistent (protean). Three sub-groups of multiracial adolescents were analyzed separately, based on their self-reported racial parentage: non-Blacks, Black/non-American Indians, and Black/American Indians. Using an identity-focused cultural ecological model (Spencer, 2006), adolescents' perceptions of their risks and protective factors (sociodemographics), as well as their beliefs about the oppression of non-Black minorities in the United States, were investigated in terms of how well (and in what combination) they predicted self-identification choice, both across race question formats and over time. Findings suggested that there were different personal and contextual factors implicated in self-identification choice for each sub-group of adolescents. For non-Blacks, generational proximity to racial mixture, the percentage of Blacks in one's neighborhood, and attitudes about racial oppression in the United States were strong predictors of racial self-identification choice. Among Black/non-American Indians, these characteristics were joined by self-perceived skin tone, academic achievement level, and age in their predictive effects. Among Black/American Indians, age, self-perceived skin tone, and attitudes about racial oppression exhibited strong main effects. There was an additional interaction effect found within this group between neighborhood diversity, skin tone, and the perception of the oppression of non-black minorities in the U.S. This work suggests that self-identification choice is linked to adolescents' perceptions of their risks and protective factors as well as their attitudes regarding the racial climate of the United States. Providing additional nuance to the literature are the differences found across racial parentage groups. By engaging a phenomenologically focused cultural ecological framework, both self-appraisal and reactive coping processes are revealed as central to racial identity development for this understudied population. Representing a mere slice of a broader research agenda, this project contributes a unique and important perspective to the emergent body of research on the rapidly growing population of multiracial Americans.

Scholars in this field claim that American discourse has falsely labeled multiracials as monoracial minorities through the unethical use of ambiguity, lying, ignorance, illogic, and stereotype. To challenge this discourse, they encourage multiracials to assert racially mixed identities through the ethics of definition, truth, knowledge, logic, and self-representation. Advocating these virtues, however, scholars imply that the multiracial subject can define, truthfully reveal, know, logically cohere, and represent herself in the first place. This ignores the extent to which all subjects remain opaque to themselves in ways that undermine the ethics of Mixed Race Studies. Considering the complications of definition, truth, knowledge, logic, and self-representation, scholars in this field must also consider the ethics of ambiguity, lying, ignorance, illogic, and stereotype. Rather than advocating definitions that divide multiracials from monoracials, scholars should use ambiguity to blur the lines between them. Instead of claiming that racially mixed people should self-identify truthfully, scholars should explore how self-identifying deceptively can challenge racial thinking. Scholars encourage the multiracial to know herself, but remaining ignorant of oneself in order to know the racial assumptions of another is a better way to undermine those assumptions. Mixed Race Studies advocates logical discourse, but illogical discourses contain the contradictions necessary to challenge racism. Multiracial autobiographers try to challenge racial assumptions with self-representation, but one might better undermine those assumptions by evoking, repeating, and subverting stereotypes. These ethics of ambiguity, lying, ignorance, illogic, and stereotype fall under what I call ""metissage ."" Metis is a French word for racially mixed people. Metissage refers to sexual, social, and conceptual hybridity that challenges racism. Metis is an ancient Greek term for cunning intelligence by which competitors defeat more powerful opponents. Metissage combines these three concepts, challenging metis to subversive forms of metissage that employ metis. I conclude that the ethics of Mixed Race Studies can and have challenged racial assumptions in American discourse, but scholars must go further and consider the ethics of metissage.

Five primary themes emerged: The Continuous Journey of Ethnic Identity Development, Situational Identity, The Maternal Relationship and its Effects on Identity Development, The Comparison of Multiracial Experiences to Monoracial Experiences, and the Asian-White Experience. A number of subthemes also were identified. Although some of the themes mirrored findings from previous multiracial research, such as identity being situationally based, new themes also emerged. In particular, themes related to the relationship between the White mother and her multiracial daughter were brought to light. In addition, preliminary results relating to the unique experience of the Asian-White subgroup when compared to the larger multiracial subgroup were identified.

Participants' stories represented multiracial experiences at thirteen different undergraduate institutions. A participant's precollege experiences, identity and the college's peer culture impacted how she approached social situations in the highly homogenous and monoracial setting at college. Participants took on the roles of pacifist, non-conformist, and activist to successfully navigate college environments and social scenarios. The findings also support prior study on the identity development of multiracial college students. Childhood experiences shaped the racial identity of participants that was affirmed and challenged, but not changed by college factors and experiences. Significant factors to the identity development of participants at college were academic courses, faculty and peers. Implications of the findings and limitations of the study are discussed.

As biracial individuals increase in number, understanding their experiences will become more important to psychologists and mental health professionals. The purpose of the study was to compare biracial individuals and monoracial individuals on measures of psychological well being, ethnic identity, and attitudes towards biracial people. The present study examined one general research question and three hypotheses: General Research Question & Hypotheses. (1) Will scores on measures of ethnic identity, individual self-esteem, collective self-esteem, subjective well being, and attitudes toward biracial children significantly differ between biracial and monoracial groups? (2) Bracey, Bamara, and Umana-Taylor's (2004) results on self-esteem and ethnic identity will be replicated in this study on adults. (3) When compared to monoracial individuals, biracial individuals will have significantly more positive attitudes towards biracials. (4) A positive relationship exists between psychological well being and attitudes towards biracials for biracial individuals. Participants completed a web-based survey from an undisclosed location of their choosing. Participants were solicited from various multicultural and professional psychology list serves and through Ohio State University's Research Experience Program. Results indicated that biracial adults appear to be as psychologically well adjusted as their monoracial counterparts. Results even suggested that biracial adults have more realized ethnic identities than their monoracial counterparts. Bracey et al.'s (2004) results were replicated in the present study (biracials were found to be as psychologically well adjusted as monoracials). Also, a positive relationship was found between biracial individuals' psychological well being and their attitudes towards multiracial children. Support for the second hypothesis was not found - biracial individuals in the study did not have more positive attitudes toward biracials than their monoracial counterparts. Implications of the findings along with the limitations of the study are discussed. Recommendations of future research are also given.

Vol.69(9-B),2009, pp. 5774.",0419-4217,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"Research has found college students use alcohol at higher rates and experience more alcohol-related problems compared to the general population, however the majority of this research has only been studied in monoracial populations. Research on multiracial individuals has begun to emerge, and findings have revealed multiracial individuals consume alcohol at higher rates compared to monoracial minority peers, and similar to higher rates compared to monoracial White peers. However this has not been studied in a college population. Additionally, multiracial identity may be assessed in multiple ways, and it is unclear whether method of racial identity assessment is important when evaluating alcohol outcomes. The current study explored rates of alcohol use and consequences in monoracial Asian and White and multiracial Asian/White college students using several methods of racial identity assessment, including based on parental racial identification, self-identification, forced choice monoracial identification, and five racial identifications based on qualitative work by Renn (2004). Results found multiracial students, based on parental and self racial identification, drank significantly more and experienced more consequences compared to monoracial Asians, and no differences were found compared to monoracial Whites. However, when multiracial participants were forced to choose a monoracial identity, multiracial students who identified as White, but not multiracial student who identified as Asian, drank significantly more and had more alcohol problems compared to monoracial Asian students. Discrimination was explored as a moderator and acculturation and cultural identity were explored as mediators between racial identity and alcohol outcomes. Results did not find a moderating effect of discrimination. Cultural identity was found to mediate the relation between racial identity and drinking, with individuals higher in White cultural identity reporting higher total weekly drinks and negative consequences. Additionally, acculturation was found to mediate the relation between racial identity and alcohol-related negative consequences, with individuals higher in acculturation reporting more negative consequences. Finally, multiracial participants were found to vary in their identification with multiracial identities, which demonstrated some impact on drinking outcomes. Overall, the results of this study highlight the complexity of assessing racial identity and drinking outcomes in multiracial college students and factors related to this relationship.

The original article included substantial portions of text from an article entitled ""Masculinity and Nationalism: Gender and Sexuality in the Making of Nations, written by Dr. Joane Nagel and published in the March 2008 Issue of Ethnic and Racial Studies. The author did not provide attribution to Dr. Nagel for the portion of her article used. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2008-06367-005). The article addresses the link between manhood and nationhood in postconflict Kosova. Albanian Kosovars, like many ""traditionally"" patriarchal societies, have constructed identities of the patriotic man and the exalted childbearing woman as icons of national survival. These designated identities often negate the realities of war-affected communities. The gendered places of man and woman in political reality are marred by the traumatic events of conflict and postconflict life. By thinking about the masculine microcultures of nation building (daily life), especially the construction of over-sexed and under-sexed individuals (i.e., the soldier) and the promiscuous enemies within (i.e., the female rape victim), there develops a connection between monoracial and heterosexual preserves and the need for this society to hold onto the traditional vision of man, at least until there is the political union of nation and state.

Edited Book","(from the chapter) Race is a socially constructed way of grouping people, which differs among societies and over time. It has no biological basis. In the United States, many individuals have experienced misrepresentation because of restrictive racial labels. Multiracial is an inclusive identification term that ""refers to people who are of two or more racial heritages"" and refers ""to people across all racial mixes"". The multiracial movement, which gained momentum in the late 1970's and early 1980's, has been proactively addressing the unique issues of the mixed race population in the United States. The multiracial movement is being pursued by people dedicated to the advancement of the rights and self-expression of multiracial individuals and families. Our chapter aims to advance the multiracial movement by bridging the language barrier that is present both within the mixed-race community and between multiracial and monoracial persons. We propose that this language barrier is the lack of a vernacular that is sufficiently reflective of the identities and existence of people of mixed heritage. The voice and authentic experiences of racially mixed people within the United States have been suppressed and silenced by a lack of inclusive terminology. Current racial conceptualizations emphasize an either/or approach that can unnecessarily dichotomize identity for people of racially mixed heritage. There is a need for people to openly consider the multiple possibilities of mixed race individuals' heritages. The language barrier in the United States can be overcome if society as a whole is willing to adopt a multiracial-affirmative language and mindset. In this chapter, we advocate suggestions for how all individuals-both multiracial and monoracial persons-can use various mixed race identity terminology, see the world through a multiracial-affirmative lens, and implement multiracial-affirmative actions.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Monoracial and multiracial individuals are likely to have different conceptualizations of race and subsequently different approaches toward racial ambiguity. In particular, monoracial individuals may be more likely to rely on categories when processing ambiguous faces, whereas multiracial individuals may tend to ignore such categorizations due to a reduced tendency to essentialize race. We compared monoracial (White and Asian) and biracial (Asian/White) individuals' memory patterns. Specifically, we examined participants' memory for White, Asian, and biracial faces labelled as either White or Asian. Both White and Asian participants relied on the labels, remembering faces labeled as the in-group better than faces labeled as the out-group. Biracial participants relied less on the labels, exhibiting better recognition memory overall. Biracial participants' memory performance was also highly correlated with a less essentialist view of human traits. This cognitive flexibility may serve an adaptive function for biracial individuals and contribute to enhanced facial recognition.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The high-stakes nature of law school testing and admissions puts a premium on the student data presented to admissions committees, such as essays, academic and work history, and student background characteristics including race/ethnicity. 4,472 law school-bound students self-identified their race/ethnicity using (a) a mutually exclusive ""choose one"" format during registration for the law school admissions test, and (b) an elaborated ""check-all-that-apply"" format as part of a national survey administered during the first weeks at their chosen law school. Student multiraciality that was masked by the first assessment was associated with self-reported ethnic identity, discrimination experience, intergroup contact, race-related attitudes, academic performance, and trait ratings, as compared to monoracial majority students. A different profile of findings was observed across these constructs when multiracial students were compared to monoracial majority students, to monoracial minority students, and within group. These correlates also predicted the likelihood of changing identification across the two assessment contexts. These findings support the continued study of specific combinations of multiracial groups, fluidity of multiracial identities, and context effects that influence race/ethnicity self-categorizations.

In contrast to the literature on the black family, which focuses primarily on low-income black families, I examine the experiences of middle class youth who have grown up in three different racialized family structures including, monoracial, biracial, and transracial families. I define monoracial families as two black parents raising their biological black child/children, biracial families as one white and one black parent raising their biological biracial child/children and transracial families as two white parents raising an adoptive black child/children. Drawing from 28 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with middle class young black adults between 18 and 30 years old, I explore informants' socialization experiences as they differ by racialized family structure. Reflecting their shared status of being both black and middle class, the formative experiences of young black adults raised in different racialized family structures are largely similar. Specifically, all informants struggled with accusations of ""acting white"" by black peers which called their ""authentic blackness"" into question. Young black women also share similar experiences of competition with and alienation from other black women, particularly those belonging to the lower classes. Finally, all informants de-emphasize the ascribed status of race in favor of achieved statuses when asked to describe and define themselves. While informants share similar racial identity struggles, their attitudes and interpretations did differ by racialized family structure. Based on their socialization experiences, informants from biracial and transracial families tend to equate blackness with conditions of urban poverty in contrast to informants from monoracial families who view black culture in diverse ways. Biracial and adopted participants also attribute their alienation from black peers to the fact that they have at least one white parent. Finally, while middle class status appears to play a role in the experiences of all informants, none willingly acknowledge the influence of class in their lives. This study concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for broader theories of middle class black identity.

Vol.68(10-A),2008, pp. 4502.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"The post-Civil Rights era has been characterized by numerous challenges to traditional understandings of race. The dismantling of legalized segregation and discrimination, ongoing immigration from Asia and Latin America, increasing acceptance of interracial contact and relationships, and relatively unceasing conflict between the Western and Arab world, are just some of the socio-political trends and events which have yielded an increasingly fluid, complex, and intricate racial terrain. Given the increasing fluidity of race in U.S. society, the overarching goal of this dissertation is to illuminate the nature and implications of changing racial identity boundaries in the post-Civil Rights era. In order to fulfill this goal, I examine (1) the experiences of university students who defy conventional racial identity categorizations, (2) the processes of organization/mobilization in which these students engage, and (3) the role universities play in shaping and responding to these students, whose racial identities and politics are often incongruent with the institutions' views of race. The majority of research on college students' racial identities and racialized political activity focuses on conventional understandings of racial identity, which rely on the assumption that there are five singular racial categories-black/African American, Latino/a, white, Asian American, and Native American. Less is known about racial identities and corollary political activity which falls outside these boundaries. My dissertation addresses this gap through a two-tiered analysis. First, I comparatively examine how students come to organize/mobilize around two identities which challenge singular or ""monoracial"" conceptualizations of race: (1) biracial identity and (2) ""people of color"" identity. Second, I examine how monoracially oriented student services (i.e., black student service offices) respond to such organization/mobilization. Study of these processes within the particular domain of higher education can assist student service practitioners in the formulation and implementation of programming on increasingly diverse campuses and can provide insight into how students can more fully participate in their universities' public life. My methods of data collection include interviews (N = 90) with students and administrators, student focus groups, observation, and archival research.

The author did not provide attribution to Dr. Nagel for the portion of her article used.] The article addresses the link between manhood and nationhood in postconflict Kosova. Albanian Kosovars, like many ""traditionally"" patriarchal societies, have constructed identities of the patriotic man and the exalted childbearing woman as icons of national survival. These designated identities often negate the realities of war-affected communities. The gendered places of man and woman in political reality are marred by the traumatic events of conflict and postconflict life. By thinking about the masculine microcultures of nation building (daily life), especially the construction of over-sexed and under-sexed individuals (i.e., the soldier) and the promiscuous enemies within (i.e., the female rape victim), there develops a connection between monoracial and heterosexual preserves and the need for this society to hold onto the traditional vision of man, at least until there is the political union of nation and state.

Edited Book","(create) In this chapter I cover both the determinants of racial identification among multiracial youth and its implications for their mental health, achievement, and self-esteem. The goals for this chapter are, first, to describe the literature on identity development among biracials as a way of challenging the notion of race as a single and fixed aspect of identity. This first goal leads logically to the second goal, which is to examine the developmental implications of flexible racial identity. Understanding these implications for multiracial youth may even shed some light on the racial identity development of monoracial youth. In keeping with my two goals, I organize the literature into two sections: one on identity development, and the other on the impact of identity on child and adolescent outcomes. Within the section on identity development, I include three subsections. The first describes general theories of multiracial identity development, the second provides details about specific race combinations (part-Black, part-Asian, part-Hispanic, part-American Indian), and the third explores the connections between context and racial identification. In the section on the impact of identity on developmental outcomes, I discuss the distinction between ancestry and racial identity for multiracial youth and explore the ways that context mediates the identification- development link among multiracial youth.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Rates and patterns of substance use and violent behaviors among multiracial adolescents were examined and compared with 3 monoracial groups, European, African, and Asian Americans. The relationships between ethnic identity and the subjective experience of racial discrimination, substance use, and violent behavior were also examined. The authors found multiracial adolescents reporting higher rates of problem behaviors. Several significant relationships between ethnic identity and racial discrimination were found with these problem behaviors.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we estimate the determinants and direction of change in individual racial identification among multiracial and monoracial adolescents as they transition to young adulthood. We find that while many multiracials subsequently identify as monoracials, sizable numbers of monoracials also subsequently become multiracials. Native American-whites appear to have the least stable identification. We find strong support that socioeconomic status, gender, and physical appearance shape the direction of change for multiracials, and that black biracials are especially compelled to identify as monoracial blacks.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99, the authors examine the extent to which biracial families differ from monoracial families in their transmission of resources to young children. In these analyses, the authors demonstrate the utility of distinguishing not only between white-biracial and nonwhite-biracial families and but also between even more refined measures of biracial families (e.g., white father/Asian mother). The authors find that, in most cases, biracial families provide comparable or greater economic and cultural resources to their children than do their monoracial counterparts, but offer fewer advantages in interactional/social resources. This overall pattern remains even after sociodemographic factors are taken into consideration. Exceptions to this pattern also are identified and explored. Implications for our understanding of racial stratification, interracial relations, and the role of both human agency and constraints on intergenerational transmission of resources are discussed.

Mixed-race individuals defy conventional monocultural and monoracial paradigms of understanding identity, and it is imperative that social workers examine the many factors that contribute to the cultural identity of the multiracial person. Through the collection of narrative stories, this qualitative study explored some of the numerous factors that shape a multiracial individual's cultural identity. Purposive sampling methods were employed to recruit a non-clinical sample of 10 multiracial individuals who reside in the Western New York area. Participants were encouraged to share their individual experiences and tell their own unique stories as related to their cultural identity through a narrative interview process (Stuhlmiller, 2001). Results from transcript analysis verify that the cultural identity of multiracial persons is highly complex and significantly influenced by: (1) personal experiences of racism and discrimination; (2) social interactions and relationships with peers and family; and (3) the racial climate of the environment (i.e., schools and neighborhoods). In addition, this study also identified several themes which provide us with a better understanding of what it is like to be a multiracial person. Finally, this study confirmed that certain models of multiracial identity development (those which are more fluid, strength-based and ecological) proved to be more sensitive and therefore more inclined to explicate some of the more complex and highly influential contextual factors that impact a multiracial person's cultural identity development. The findings from this study can help strengthen the therapeutic relationship with multiracial clients throughout the assessment and treatment phases of clinical therapy.

Vol.67(11-A),2007, pp. 4347.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"This study: (1) examined whether multiracial young adults reported lower levels of well-being relative to their White and monoracial minority peers and whether these outcomes were moderated by college attendance or racial identification; and (2) investigated factors, drawn from Root's (2003) ecological model of multiracial identity development, during adolescence that could predict better well-being outcomes for young adults. Participants were 18-26 years old and drawn from the Wave III archival data of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Bearman, Jones, & Udry, 1997), a nationally representative school-based probability sample of participants initially surveyed in 1994-1995, with the Wave III follow-up conducted six years later in 2001-2002. Using a subset of 14,644 participants (615 multiracial, 4,686 monoracial minority, and 9,343 White) the multiracial young adults reported statistically higher levels of depression, drug abuse and physical limitations, and lower levels of self worth than their monoracial counterparts. Effect sizes (partial eta squared), however, were so small, varying between .001 and .003, that these statistical findings did not represent meaningful differences. Therefore, the current study found evidence of fewer difficulties of multiracial young adults relative to their monoracial peers, when compared to previous researchers who studied the same sample as adolescents and found consistent patterns of negative well-being (Milan & Keiley, 2000; Udry et al., 2003). In part this may be because previous researchers did not present effect sizes. Using a second subset of 8,978 participants (402 multiracial, 2,617 monoracial minority, and 5,959 White) a two phased, multi-group structural equation model examined the relationship between adolescence and young adulthood factors and found that multiracial participants had the highest path coefficients for depression and living with both biological parents in comparison to their monoracial counterparts. College attendance was found to not change the relationship of multiracial young adults on reported well-being outcomes in comparison to their monoracial counterparts. In the area of multiracial identification, there was no evidence that multiracial young adults who reported their racial category as multiracial versus monoracial exhibited higher well-being outcomes. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Sixty-one Biracial participants were assessed on measures of depression, trait anxiety, and social anxiety to ascertain if their racial identity choice impacted their scores on these psychological measures. Societal pressure to identify as monoracial was also measured to determine if the various racial identity groups perceived these pressures differently and if these pressures were related to the reported quality of psychological functioning. Results indicated that a validated Biracial identity may serve as a protective factor for anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas Biracial individuals who consider their race to be meaningless or fluid based on situational factors reported significantly higher levels of depression and trait anxiety symptoms than other Biracial individuals. The latter group also reported the least pressure from family to identify as monoracial. Societal pressure from peers to identify as monoracial was found to predict social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation among all Biracial participants (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15283480701326018,,"social anxiety, racial identity, depression, biracial individuals",Affective Disorders [3211].,,20070723 (PsycINFO),Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research,,103-114,English,"Lawrence Erlbaum, US",Journal Article,"*Ethnic Identity

Peer Reviewed Journal","Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we utilize the concepts of homophily, blending, and amalgamation to describe the possible friendship patterns of multiracials. Homophily occurs when multiracials are most likely to choose other multiracials as friends. Blending occurs when friendship patterns of multiracials are somewhere in-between those of their monoracial counterparts. Amalgamation consists of friendship patterns that are similar to one of their monoracial counterparts. All groups exhibit signs of amalgamation such that non-white multiracials resemble Blacks, and White multiracials resemble whites except for Black-White multiracials. Black-Whites, Asian-Whites, and Asian-Blacks also exhibit signs of blending, while only Native American multiracials show signs of homophily. Multiracials have different experiences depending on their specific racial composition, and while they seem to bridge the distance between racial groups, their friendship patterns also fall along Black and White lines.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Multiracial individuals are more likely to have a heightened awareness of race as a social construct than monoracial individuals. This article examines the impact that a heightened awareness of race as a social construct has on the relationship between racial stereotypes and performance. Study 1 finds that multiracial individuals reported subscribing less to the notion that race biologically determines ability. Study 2 finds that monoracial individuals show stereotype activation, whereas multiracial individuals show stereotype inhibition in reaction to race salience. Study 3 draws on the work on stereotypes and performance to test the susceptibility of multiracial individuals to racial stereotypes about ability. The authors find that Asian/White and Black/White multiracial individuals were less susceptible to racial stereotypes than monoracial individuals. Whereas monoracial participants showed significant performance changes in reaction to race salience, multiracial individuals did not. Study 4 finds that emphasizing the social construction of race buffers individuals from stereotype threat effects.

The study used qualitative methods to gather information through formal and informal interviews with biracial students over eighteen years old reflecting on their own high school experiences. Several white teachers and administrators were also interviewed in order to gain perspective from the adults who worked with biracial children. The theoretical framework used analysis through the lens of Symbolic Interaction Theory and Critical Race Theory. The findings proved that biracial adolescents felt pressured by peers to choose a racial identity that fits the way hey appeared racially. The study also looked at the way the formal school setting; teachers, curriculum, institutional forms, and school activities created a monoracial label for biracial students. The data from this study showed that biracial individuals are forced to live within ""color boundaries"" created by the social construction of race. The biracial individuals interviewed created a self-identity that was affected by how others categorized them racially---""black"" or ""white."" Eventually, they came to an understanding of their own identity through a multiracial lens and ignore the social construction of race. A socialization framework for understanding biracial identity is introduced as a new way of looking and thinking about race in America today.

Vol.66(7-B),2006, pp. 4000.",0419-4217,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"This study examined the relationship between levels of cultural exposure, ethnic makeup (Caucasian, Monoracial, Multiracial) and levels of prejudice (attitudes toward racial diversity and attitudes toward the multiracial population). It was thought that intimate, positive interaction with different cultures (cultural exposure) would reduce one's level of prejudice (increase positive attitudes toward racial diversity). It was hoped that the Multiracial population could help shed light on the idea that increased positive and intimate interaction with other cultures helps reduce prejudice in the larger society. Perhaps because Multiracials have the opportunity to be intimately exposed to two different cultures in their own family, they may demonstrate higher levels of cultural exposure and more positive attitudes toward racial diversity. This study was conducted with a college-age population from Southern California and included 175 Caucasians, Monoracials and Multiracials between the ages of 18 and 25 years (51 Caucasians, 64 Monoracials and 60 Multiracials). Each participant completed the Quick Discrimination Index or QDI (Ponterotto et al., 1995), the Attitudes Toward Multiracial Children Scale or AMCS (Jackman et al., 2001), the Cultural Exposure Questionnaire or CEQ (designed by the researcher) and a Background Questionnaire. The results showed that for Caucasians, high scores on the CEQ (more cultural exposure) tended to occur with higher scores on the QDI (more positive attitudes toward racial diversity). This was not found to be significant for Monoracials or Multiracials. It was also found that Multiracials had higher scores on the CEQ than Caucasians but not Monoracials, and that Caucasians had significantly lower scores on the CEQ compared to both groups. Results showed that Multiracials had significantly higher scores on the QDI than both groups, but no differences were found between Monoracials and Caucasians. It was also shown that ethnic group and scores on the CEQ accounted for more variability in the QDI than either separately. There were no differences in scores found between groups on the AMCS for any hypothesis in this study. This researcher also attempted to look at differences between dual Multiracials and those with one Caucasian parent, however possibly due to small sample size, no differences were found.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The psychological well-being and ethnic identity of biracial adolescents are largely underrepresented topics in current scholarly literature, despite the growing population of biracial and multiracial individuals in the United States. This study examined self-esteem, ethnic identity, and the relationship between these constructs among biracial and monoracial adolescents (n = 3282). Using analysis of covariance, significant differences emerged between biracial and monoracial adolescents on both a measure of self-esteem and a measure of ethnic identity. Specifically, biracial adolescents showed significantly higher levels of self-esteem than their Asian counterparts, but significantly lower selfesteem than Black adolescents. Furthermore, biracial adolescents scored significantly higher than Whites on a measure of ethnic identity, but scored lower than their Black, Asian, and Latino peers on the same measure. Finally, correlational analyses revealed a significant and positive relationship between ethnic identity and self-esteem for all groups.

Early writers assumed that multiracial people would necessarily have difficulties with psychological adjustment, but this idea has not been supported by findings of research conducted outside of clinical settings. The current study examined whether multiracial people have more difficulty with self-esteem and psychological adjustment as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) and Adjective Checklist (ACL). The sample included 60 women and 23 men who identified themselves as multiracial. Age of the participants ranged from 19 to 29, with a mean age of 22. Seventy-eight percent identified as heterosexual and eight percent as gay, lesbian or bisexual. More than half are currently undergraduate students. Most of the participants live either on the west coast or in New York. A one-sample t-test showed that the mean self-esteem score of the multiracial sample was higher than a monoracial norm group, t (82) = 2.848, p = .0056. Furthermore, feelings of inferiority among the multiracial group were significantly lower than the mostly White, monoracial norm group, t (72) = -2.227, p = 0.0291. Limitations of the study were identified as the size of the sample, selection bias and cohort effects. Most participants were young, educated and raised in geographic areas of ethnic diversity. All were born well after the repeal of the last laws barring interracial marriage. Additional limitations cited were the lack of defined norms for the RSE and the absence of adequate information on the norm groups used to design the ACL. Although the results cannot be generalized, the findings call into question negative societal expectations about self-esteem and adjustment of multiracial people.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in see record 2004-10574-001.) Discusses biracial women in therapy. The existence of racially mixed persons in America challenges long-held notions about the biological, moral, and social meaning of race. In order to be effective in the therapeutic setting, therapists and counselors need to be aware of the socio-cultural factors encountered by this population and develop their interventions accordingly. The culturally competent psychologist needs to work from a framework that is not only sensitive to issues regarding minority identity development, but also incorporates an understanding of how biracial identity development differs from monoracial development. It is time to move beyond linear models of identity development that only examine how one deals with racial oppression or ethnic identification to a multidimensional framework that conceptualizes biracial women as racial/ethnic beings, gendered beings, sexual beings, mothers, daughters, partners, and friends. Therapists must be open to the multitude of ways their clients might choose to resolve their biracial identity and be able to facilitate exploration and movement toward goals that are consistent with each client's definition of what is healthy for her.

Peer Reviewed Journal","The current study explored essential themes of racial identity development among 10 self-identified multiracial adults from a variety of racial backgrounds. Participants were interviewed using a semistructured protocol, and the interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then coded for themes by research team members. Four primary themes were identified: encounters with racism, reference group orientation, the ""chameleon"" experience, and the importance of social context in identity development. A number of subthemes also were identified. Although several of the themes mirrored those associated with contemporary biracial and multiracial identity development models, new themes centering on the adoption of multiple self-labels reflecting both monoracial and multiracial backgrounds emerged as well. Implications of the findings for future research and practice are identified.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Sexuality scholars largely neglect interracial intimacy in the United States as a site worthy of sustained empirical research. Consequently, monoraciality is not adequately problematized or identified as a racial prerequisite to fundamental heterosexual privileges. Further, by implicitly constructing same-sex couples as monoracial, scholars fail to consider how heterosexuality and White supremacy together saturate public spaces to render queer interraciality profoundly invisible. In this essay I critique the monoracial bias of sexuality research by analyzing interracial narratives on the topic of visibility. Using in-depth qualitative interviews with four heterosexual and four same-sex interracial couples, I argue that for interracial partners a paradoxical tension surrounds visibility. Though couples may seek public affirmation of intimate relationships, for both heterosexual and queer interracial couples, public recognition risks harassment or violence.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Much attention has been directed toward understanding the impact having a multiracial background has on psychological well-being and adjustment. Past psychological research has focused on the challenges multiracial individuals confront in defining a racial identity. The implication is that these challenges lead to outcomes that are psychologically detrimental. However, evidence to support this assertion is mixed. The authors review qualitative and quantitative empirical research examining multiracial individuals' identity development, depression, problem behaviors, peer relationships, school performance, and self-esteem, finding support for detrimental outcomes only in studies sampling clinical populations. Studies on nonclinical samples find that multiracial individuals tend to be just as well-adjusted as their monoracial peers on most psychological outcomes. Earlier assertions of maladjustment may have been due to reliance on qualitative research that sampled clinical populations. Other implications and future research are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal","After World War II, Chinese residents of Singapore demanded the establishment of local Chinese universities. The ruling regime, however, which was under the shadow of the neighboring Malay-dominated Malay Peninsula, was forced to suppress the development of such schools. In Hong Kong, the British needed to install a Chinese university to counter Beijing's and Taiwan's campaigns for recruiting students from the colony. As Hong Kong was a monoracial Chinese society, the government, not having to worry about the reaction of other indigenous groups, met this challenge by founding a fully recognized Chinese university. This research demonstrates that under diverse backgrounds of racial politics, state authorities have unequal latitudes to accommodate the educational institutions of subordinated racial groups. It also reveals that state education policies in small and dependent settings, unlike those in big and sovereign nations, are more susceptible to pressures from external powers and influences from the metropolis. These findings urge scholars to pay more attention to the factor of race and use comparative methods when employing the theories of state and hegemony to investigate education and power.

Rarely have those of mixed racial heritage who use a monoracial self-label been included in the biracial literature. 619 undergraduate students at an historically Black university were originally surveyed. Students were asked to describe their race/ethnicity and that of their biological parents. Those students with one Black and one White parent who labeled themselves Black, African-American, or Afro-American were selected as participants. Nine Black/White biracial students between the ages of 18 and 23 completed face-to-face, open-ended, exploratory interviews concerning their racial identity and their use of racial self-labels with a Black/Jewish biracial researcher. Findings included differences in racial identity and racial self-label use based on socioeconomic status (SES). Lower SES students maintained a consistent Black racial identity and racial self-label use in all contexts despite having a White parent. Middle and upper SES students demonstrated a biracial identity and the practice of switching racial labels (i.e., Black, White, biracial, mixed) based on context. Recommendations for future research and implications for counseling are presented.

Peer Reviewed Journal","This paper categorizes 1,496 multiracial youth ages 14 to 19 and compares them with each other and with monoracial youth on identity development measures. The multiracial categories used here are derived from youths' reports of their own and their parents' race(s). Comparisons are made within groups of multiracial respondents who make different choices among single-race categories. Results show differences between subgroups in strength and importance of ethnic identity, self-esteem, and perceptions of ethnic discrimination. Multinomial logistic regression shows further that physiognomy, ethnic identity, and race of coresident parent(s) are significantly associated with reported race. Also related to racial identification among part-Hispanic youth are the racial distribution and socioeconomic status of their neighborhoods and the racial distributions of their schools.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Discusses biracial women in therapy. The existence of racially mixed persons in America challenges long-held notions about the biological, moral, and social meaning of race. In order to be effective in the therapeutic setting, therapists and counselors need to be aware of the socio-cultural factors encountered by this population and develop their interventions accordingly. The culturally competent psychologist needs to work from a framework that is not only sensitive to issues regarding minority identity development, but also incorporates an understanding of how biracial identity development differs from monoracial development. It is time to move beyond linear models of identity development that only examine how one deals with racial oppression or ethnic identification to a multidimensional framework that conceptualizes biracial women as racial/ethnic beings, gendered beings, sexual beings, mothers, daughters, partners, and friends. Therapists must be open to the multitude of ways their clients might choose to resolve their biracial identity and be able to facilitate exploration and movement toward goals that are consistent with each client's definition of what is healthy for her.

Empirical support for the biracial models proposed by Kich (1992), Jacobs (1992), Poston (1990), Collins (2000), and Root (1990) is also presented. The literature provides support for the theory that biracial identity is multiply determined depending on such factors as family, family history, community environment, geographical location, and historical time period. Findings suggest that racial identity is fluid over time and, often, situation; and it may not always be the most salient identity at any given time. Multiracial individuals appear to function as well socially and psychologically as monoracial individuals under similar conditions. Empirical research on this topic is limited and weakened by the use of small sample sizes, by the use of clinical populations as normative, and, in some cases, do not account for racism as a negative social influence. Future research implications are suggested.

The participants were interviewed using an interview protocol created for the purpose of describing their experiences of identity construction in their doctoral programs. The interview covered the following domains: (1) background and family information, (2) experiences in classes, (3) the peer community, (4) mentorship relationships, and (5) clinical placements. The study was conducted from a phenomenological perspective and its data analyzed according to a method of thematic analysis adapted from Georgi (1985). Results were presented on three levels: situated summaries for each participant of her graduate experiences, general themes frequently endorsed by at least two participants throughout the interview, and themes depicting participants' experiences in each of the interview domains of classes, peer community, mentorship, and clinical experience. Findings indicate that all of the participants expressed feelings of racial difference in their graduate programs. Participants described this sense of difference in both negative and positive terms: often they felt like outsiders in groups of monoracial people of color and like multiracial representatives in classes; they also felt that they could negotiate their way in multiple racial groups and form connections with others who felt marginalized. Participants prioritized their ethnic minority identities over their White identities: they focused on exploring and identifying with their ethnic minority backgrounds whereas they associated their White backgrounds with the privileges of the dominant culture. The study also found that although participants had multicultural courses, the large majority of participants did not have any courses which included material on multiracial peoples. Most courses presented the races as separate entities, causing participants to feel ""invisible"" or pressured to choose one race in their multiracial background with which to identify. Participants presented several recommendations for graduate programs, one being that courses include the psychologies of multiracial groups when discussing people of color.

Data was drawn from the core sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The Add Health public-use data set includes interviews of 6,504 adolescents and 4,600 parents. On the Add Health survey, adolescents were asked multiple questions to assess their racial/ethnic background. Results suggest that biracial/biethnic youth are a particularly vulnerable group in terms of self-reported delinquency, school problems, internalizing symptoms, and self-regard. As a group, they are also more likely to receive some form of psychological intervention. Given these findings and the shortcoming of clinical resources for work with this population, the authors provide a discussion of why biracial youth may be particularly vulnerable from a social constructionist framework and offer several strategies based on narrative family therapy for working with biracial youngsters and their families.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Examined a measure of ethnic identity, the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM; J. S. Phinney, 1992), with a sample of 2,184 11-15 yr olds who self-identified with a single race (monoracial, n = 1,812) or with 2 or more racial or ethnic groups (multiracial, n = 372). The psychometric properties and mean differences on the MEIM for White, monoracial minority, and multiracial early adolescents were investigated. Principal components and multigroup confirmatory factor analysis were used to explore and confirm the factor structure of the MEIM items. Two factors were identified: (1) identification and (2) exploration. Identification was represented by items that reflect a sense of belonging and pride in an individual's ethnic group. Exploration was represented by items that characterize a search for ethnic group identity and participation in ethnic practices. Results show reliabilities for the 2 subscales were alpha = .84 for identification and alpha = .76 for exploration. Also, the results indicate that most individuals from monoracial minority groups and multiracial subgroups scored similarly on overall ethnic identity.

However, mean preferences of Black and White Ss were significantly different, such that White Ss were more pro-White than Black Ss. PRAM II scores for biracial Ss were primarily based on the combination of positive affect toward White and negative affect toward Black. Although Black Ss made negative choices toward Black, their racial attitude score was dependent on the balance of positive choices for Black and White.

Through the case study method, the authors describe the course and progression of racial identity development (RID) in these 2 individuals and discuss some key themes in their lives that have contributed to the development of their RID. The purposes are fourfold: to describe, nonclinical subjective experiences of being biracial in the US, to explore the differences in the paths that 2 biracial individuals can take to achieve what looks superficially like similar Black racial identity resolution, to demonstrate how identifying as Black can have different meanings and consequences for 2 biracial people, and to contribute to the differentiation of Black RID from biracial Black/White RID.

I argued that the cultural revival and political self-empowerment in Hawaii would have positively influenced Hawaiian children's racial attitudes, in that they would no longer accept the negative stereotypes (e.g., unintelligent) that were assigned to them by early European missionaries and White Americans. The primary hypothesis was that in a classroom assessment situation, Hawaiian children would rate the photos of other Hawaiian children as equally or significantly more academically able than the photos representing children of the Japanese and White American races. Contrary to the hypothesis, Hawaiian children rated White and Japanese American children as significantly more academically able than children from their own race. The second hypothesis was that Hawaiian children attending a private-monoracial school (Kamehameha Elementary enrolling only Hawaiians) would rate Hawaiian photos significantly higher than children attending a public-multiracial school (Waiakea Elementary). Again, contrary to this hypothesis, children in both schools rated the Hawaiian photos as being the least academically able and the White American photos as being the most academically able. The third hypothesis was that girls would rate girl photos higher and boys would rate boy photos higher. Contrary to this hypothesis, there was no significant interaction effect between sex of the participants and sex of the photos. Similarly, this study showed that socioeconomic status and socialization in the Hawaiian cultural heritage were not significant predictors of how Hawaiian students rated photos of children from the three racial groups. Thus, the perceptions of Hawaiian elementary school students were relatively independent of school type (private vs. public), sex, socioeconomic status, and socialization in the Hawaiian culture. The race of illustrated children was the strongest variable in this study. These findings support the theoretical notion that negative racial identity attitudes of visible racial and ethnic minority groups toward their respective groups subsume other variables, such as socioeconomic status and geographic location (Cross, 1978). Helms' (1995, 1996) revised Black Racial Identity Development (BIRD) model was used to explain the study's theoretical basis and results. Implications of the findings and the limitations of the study have been discussed.

This study explored several aspects of multiracial identity. First, within a college population 159 surveys were administered to students between the ages of 18 and 36 to explore the relationship between one's personal ethnic identity and that of one's ancestors. Over seventeen percent of respondents reported having at least one relative in the last four generations who was described as racially different than other relatives. Only a third of these respondents identified themselves as multiracial. Biracial people who identified themselves as monoracial despite having parents of two different racial groups were interviewed to understand the process of their identity formation. Five of the sixteen people interviewed identified monoracially. Most of those who identified monoracially (all identified with their nonWhite reference group) stated that affiliating themselves with their nonWhite culture was siding with the ""right"" side given the history of oppression in this country against people of color. Other reasons included contact with only one parent, and greater simplicity in reporting status. Second, multiracial participants were interviewed to ascertain the ways in which they came to terms with their racial and ethnic identities. Root's (1996) description of four coping mechanisms were tested. While at least a few examples were found to support all of Root's proposed constructs, participants were most likely to identify as either monoracial or multiracial. Interviews were conducted with sixteen people to attempt to understand the influences on ethnic and racial identity formation. Family appeared to be the largest contributor to ethnic-racial identity development among biracial individuals. Other important influences included peers, messages specific to ethnic and racial identity, community, school, history, language, and phenotype. Limitations to this study were related to sampling. Geographical diversity of participants was lacking, and their were large age differences between respondents. Also, participants had relatively high levels of education. Responses by participants may have also been affected by demand characteristics of the interview process. Further research could address limitations and build upon the findings of the current study.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Mass media sources such as television and movies arguably offer up little in the way of positive Asian/Asian American images or role models. This article contends that the media do not often portray the diversity that is inherent within the Asian American culture and that such a paucity of Asian images may greatly affect perceptions Asian Americans may hold both of their own racial group and of the larger society. This article examines both media images of Asians and Asian Americans and autobiographical information from Asian American literature to illustrate the potentially detrimental effects of being a person of color in a society that emphasizes a monoracial standard of beauty. Information gleaned from first-hand accounts from Asian Americans often points to the media as a potent source of information as to how attractiveness is defined and measured. This article concludes with a discussion of some brief case examples and ethical imperatives for mental health workers in terms of both self-awareness and education as well as considerations for culturally sensitive therapy.

This dissertation examines common psychological dynamics that have been established in research literature. By utilizing these dynamics, a children's picture book was created that conveys the intricacies of being multiracial. The book is intended to help teachers, psychologists, parents, and children to generate conversations that examine questions of race and ethnicity.

The construct of ethnic identity was examined along with factors identified in the literature as influencing racial/ethnic identity development such as family support of multiracial heritage, sense of belonging, coping with discrimination, and racial/ethnic legitimacy testing. An attempt was also made to explore how ethnic identity and other factors such as self-esteem, racial diversity of the community in which one was raised, and choice of self-label are related. Seventy-three multiracial adults completed measures that assessed ethnic identity, self-esteem, racial/ethnic legitimacy testing experiences, family support of multiracial heritage and coping. Results indicated that a majority of participants had experienced racial/ethnic legitimacy testing from those racial groups which were part of their racial/ethnic heritage. While self-esteem was not found to be related to racial/ethnic legitimacy testing as predicted, statistically significant relationships were obtained between self-esteem and ethnic identity, and self-esteem and family support of multiraciality. Family support of multiraciality and racial diversity of neighborhood in which individual was raised were found to be significant predictors of ethnic identity. This finding is consistent with existing literature which has identified these two factors as having a positive impact on racial identity resolution. Participants were asked to identify a stressful situation in which they felt rejected due to some aspect of their multiracial heritage. A component of ethnic identity labeled ethnic identity achievement was found to be related to coping strategies that involved attempts to either alter this stressful situation or create some positive meaning from it. No significant predictors of choice of monoracial or multiracial self-label were identified. Methodological limitations of some of the measures, as well as the small sample size, were identified as reasons for interpreting these findings with caution. Further research using improved measures to assess the constructs of interest was recommended. Implications for counseling were discussed.

Developing an understanding of the perception of friendships and peer relationships held by biracial children is particularly important given that social relationships may be more complicated for them than for monoracial children. Participants in this study were girls between the ages of 8 and 11. This study compared the friendship and peer relationship perceptions of monoracial (African American) and biracial African American-Caucasian girls. Participants (N = 25) were interviewed using the Cornell Interview of Peer and Friends (CIPF). Their mothers filled out a short racial identity/demographics questionnaire. It was hypothesized that biracial girls face a more complex developmental process than monoracial girls, and thus more difficulties in the areas of friendship and peer relationships. The quantitative analysis found no differences between monoracial and biracial girls on CIPF overall scores. Biracial girls received higher scores on the subscale Developmental Appropriateness, indicating more maturity in this area. In addition, biracial girls reported a more stable experience of themselves with all friends and more general satisfaction with their friendships than did monoracial girls. Other differences were found between participants classified as higher income versus those classified as lower income. Higher income participants received healthier overall scores on the CIPF. They also indicated that it was easier to get children to play with them and they had less negative interactions with their peers. A qualitative analysis revealed a thoughtful and insightful understanding of friendship for both monoracial and biracial girls. Participant mothers also gave cogent accounts of addressing race related issues with their daughters. Results indicated a similar developmental pattern for monoracial and biracial girls and suggested that bi (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,,"friendship patterns & peer relations, 8-11 yr old African American vs African American-Caucasian girls",Developmental Psychology [2800]; Social Psychology [3000].,,19960101 (PsycINFO),Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering,Dec,4054,English,,Dissertation,"*Friendship

Because biracial children have a dual heritage, they may not categorize people in terms of discrete categories based on appearance. If this is the case, biracial children would consider other aspects of the person, such as their social behavior, to be more important than race. It was hypothesized that biracial children would not be influenced by the race of a mischievous protagonist in making discipline judgments. Monoracial White and Black children were expected to weigh race more heavily in evaluating the behaviors of cross-race children. This study also analyzed children's moral judgments to see whether there was a significant difference as a function of the level of damage caused by the protagonist in hypothetical situations involving intentional aggression. Subjects were also predicted to decrease their initial discipline rating after they were given extenuating information about the protagonist. Seventy-two biracial male children, 72 White male children and 55 Black male children were randomly assigned to see pictures of and hear stories about a White, Black or no race protagonist. Each subject responded to stories depicting both high and low damage outcomes. After each story, they indicated how much discipline the protagonist deserved, heard the extenuating information, and again gave a discipline rating. There were no significant differences in the ratings of high and low damage information. Discipline ratings decreased significantly after extenuating information was given for all subjects. Black subjects gave higher discipline ratings to White protagonists than to Black protagoni (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,,"discipline judgments, biracial vs black vs white male children",Health & Mental Health Treatment & Prevention [3300]; Social Psychology [3000].,,19950101 (PsycINFO),Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering,Dec,3448,English,,Dissertation,"*Child Discipline

Exploration into the empirical relationship between stages of biracial identity development and perceived alienation was investigated in a sample of 83 biracial (African-American/Caucasian) adults living in Southern California. Subjects were recruited from local and college newspapers. Subjects had the option of completing a questionnaire through the mail or by telephone. The development of the BIDI consisted of establishing a theoretical base and item pool, having experts rate the items, administering the scale, and running statistical analyses. The five subscales included: Lack of Salience, Conflict, Monoracial Identification, Appreciation, and Interaction. Lack of Salience and Conflict exhibited ""respectable"" internal-consistency reliability scores. A non-experimental method with a correlational and cross-sectional design was utilized. Alienation included the constructs Normlessness, Powerlessness, and Social Isolation. The investigator hypothesized that people at different levels of the biracial identity development stages would differ in Normlessness, Powerlessness, and Social Isolation scores and that the biracial identity subscales would account for a significant portion of the explained variance in Alienation. Results suggest that biracial adults who are high vs. low on the Conflict and Monoracial Identification subscales of biracial identity significantly varied in the degrees of Alienation experienced. Subjects with higher Conflict scores had higher Powerlessness scores, while subjects with higher Monoracial Identification scores had higher Social Isolation scores. However, the low reliability on the Monoracial Identification subscale indicates that these results need to be interpreted cautiously. Appreciation approached significance with individuals higher in Appreciation experiencing less Social Isolatio (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,,"development & quantitative examination of Biracial Identity Development Inventory (BIDI), relationship between biracial identity development & alienation, African-American/Caucasian adults",Health & Mental Health Treatment & Prevention [3300]; Developmental Psychology [2800].,,19950101 (PsycINFO),Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering,Nov,2851,English,,Dissertation,"*Adult Development

Vol.56(3-A), Sep 1995, pp. 0806.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,"Multiracial children, who are the offspring of multiple racial unions, have unique needs which are possibly not being met in the schools because, among other things, they are racially categorized on the basis of ""one race only"" on school forms. This monoracial categorization has become a visible symbol that acts as a foundation for a much wider array of experiences and situations in our schools and communities which affect the racial self-image of multiracial children. This incomplete categorization affects awareness and funding for supportive measures which should be available to them. The basic question which this dissertation raises is the question of whether the needs of interracial children are being met in the schools. In order to study this question, the school's racial categorization procedures as predominant cultural forms were investigated by way of its instruments--school forms, curriculum, resources, cultural programming and school material culture. In order to answer these questions, this inquiry utilized predominantly two methods of data collection: (1) documentation analysis of government and school forms and (2) semi-structured interviews with teachers as key informants. To establish a focus for the direction of the research, a theory of radical pedagogy was used to critically analyze the role of the schools in fostering or obstructing a more positive racial identity in interracial children and a theory of classification to provide a framework to analyze both the nature and language of our racial categorization procedures and its' instruments in the schools. This dissertation found that the schools do unknowingly make the normal racial identity development process problematic for at least some of those students who might want to select more than one racial identity. Multiracial children's invisibility in the schools' racial categorization procedures mirrors a wider range of their invisibility in school curriculum, books, cultural programs, class (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,,racial categorization procedures of schools & self-image of multiracial children,Educational Psychology [3500].,,19950101 (PsycINFO),Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences,Sep,806,English,,Dissertation,"*Cultural Sensitivity

Reviews the book, Racially Mixed People in America by Maria P. P. Root (Ed.) (see record 1992-97305-000). In this edited volume, Root presents a new paradigm for the emerging multiracial population in America. The call for deconstruction of existing theory and the creation of new paradigms for understanding and investigating the multicultural experience is a major premise of this book. Existing social, political, and theoretical frameworks--based on monocultural, monoracial, linear models of social relations and social identity--have forced biracial individuals to choose one or the other culture and to deny significant parts of their heritage and existence. These models mirror the dichotomous, forced choice schemes of racial classification. This volume seeks to correct these practices and perceptions by presenting alternative approaches to social identity and racial classification based on the incorporation of simultaneous membership and multiple, fluid identities.

A doll selection procedure originally described by K. B. Clark and M. K. Clark (1939, 1947) to study racial awareness and preferences in Black children was employed with 120 kindergarten, 1st-, and 3rd-grade children. Most Ss showed a marked preference for White over comparable Black dolls. However, more Black doll selections were made in multiracial than in monoracial schools, particularly among male Ss. White doll color preference also significantly decreased at the 3rd-grade level. This finding was consistently observed in response to each racial preference question. Neither race of the interviewer nor sex of the child had a significant effect on doll color preferences. Few errors were made in response to a series of 5 racial identification questions.

Peer Reviewed Journal","Examined variations in attitudes toward race-related concepts among Black, White, and Mexican-American children in 4 urban schools representing both multiracial and monoracial environments. Ss were 392 3rd-6th graders 7-22 yrs old, 57% males and 43% females, and almost equally divided into 3 academic achievement levels. The investigators designed the MRP-Selected Race Related Concepts Instrument, utilizing the semantic differential model so that each of 6 concepts was evaluated by a set of bipolar adjective pairs. Based on the percentage of positive and negative responses, for all concepts except ""Spanish,"" positive responses were significant. Ss gave preference to concepts related to their own group and displayed negativism toward each other. With the exception of Mexican-Americans, Ss in monoracial schools were more positive toward their own group. Results imply that racially mixed schools do not necessarily promote positive racial attitudes, nor do monoracial schools necessarily promote negative attitudes.

The effects of several independent variables were examined: school type (monoracial and multiracial); grade level (kindergarten, third and fifth grade); sex of child; and race of tester (black and white). Black Ss preferred black dolls to white dolls and white Ss preferred white dolls to black dolls. However, white Ss in multiracial schools preferred white dolls significantly less than white Ss in monoracial schools.
