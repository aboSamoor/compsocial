Seventy-eight subjects in early sobriety from an urban alcohol rehabilitation facility were interviewed using the SCID, and completed the CES-D, POMS, and GWB scales. Six months later, 78% participated in a brief phone interview. Ethnic differences emerged strongly for the comorbidity of drug/dependence and prepubertal depression with alcoholism, and less strongly for generalized anxiety disorder. Ethnic differences in antisocial personality and alcohol-related depression existed for some age groups. Ethnic differences in current major depressive disorder at follow-up were observed for males only. For mood states, ethnic differences were found only for the vigor and tension subscales of the POMS. Age differences were observed in tension, depression, anger, and confusion (POMS), while gender differences emerged on the anger and fatigue dimensions of the POMS. A deeper understanding of how ethnic factors interact with social class, age and gender may enhance alcohol prevention and treatment.

Since there is a need for consistent terminology with respect to these distinct dimensions, the following new terms are offered to differentiate among them: ""physioethnicity"" refers to the physiological dimension of racioethnicity; ""socioethnicity"" refers to the sociocultural dimension; and ""psychoethnicity"" refers to the psychological dimension. Results showed that for the dominant group (Hispanics in this case) (1) bicultural and multicultural individuals were more satisfied with coworkers than acultural and monocultural individuals and (2) individuals with higher strength of psychoethnicity were more satisfied with coworkers, the work itself, and supervision than those with lower strength of psychoethnicity.

Qualitative and quantitative research methods were utilized in addition to a self-portrait drawing, a sociogram, and the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale. African-American children often fail to add skin tone color to their self-portrait drawings. Being able to positively identify with one's self is essential in today's multicultural society. A number of studies have addressed racial awareness, racial preference and racial identification of children. However, no studies have addressed the enhancement of African-American children's self-concept through a discipline-based multicultural art curriculum. The subjects involved in this study were 238 fourth- and fifth-grade students from two public schools in central Florida. A quasi-experimental design was used because intact classes were used with African-American students as the subjects for study. Body color and self-portrait drawings were analyzed separately using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Qualitative results (body color) indicated that the students' became more cognizant of using skin tone color in their self-portrait drawings. Quantitative results of the body color indicated that the pretest was not an effective covariant for the posttest, (F (1,45) = 4.51, p < .05). Sociogram analyses indicated that the more popular students were perceived as role models. The Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale results indicated that there was no significant main effect for time (pre to post) observed (Wilks' Lambda =.9996, F (1,46) = .0173, p > .05).

Emphasizing the individual's embeddedness in the family and the multicultural milieu, the authors theorized that cultural forces affect all family members and their interactions with one another and that these changes in family dynamics underlie difficulties in cultural adjustment. The participants in this study, 204 Vietnamese and 36 Chinese Vietnamese college students, completed a questionnaire relating to their perceptions of their acculturation, parental acculturation, family functioning, and their cultural adjustment difficulties. Three sets of analyses were performed: path model analyses, ANOVA's, and correlations of socioeconomic variables with acculturation, family functioning, and cultural adjustment difficulties. The main focus of this investigation involved model analyses, which were evaluated using the EQS structural equations program (Bentler, 1995). The findings of the path analyses provided support for Szapocznik and Kurtines' (1993) Embedded in Multicultural Contexts model. Intergenerational acculturation was associated with family functioning and the adult children's cultural adjustment difficulties. In addition, family functioning was noted to have mediating effects on the adult children's cultural adjustment difficulties. Group differences between the two ethnic groups were noted in one area of cultural adjustment difficulties. Further analyses using ANOVA's to examine differences in acculturation types provided additional support for the Embedded in Multicultural Contexts theory. Overall, the traditional types in the Vietnamese sample reported significantly more cultural adjustment difficulties than the assimilated types. Adult children who perceived their parents to be bicultural types also reported significantly higher family cohesion than those who perceived their parents to be marginal types. In addition, adult children who perceived their parents to be bicultural and assimilated types reported significantly less cultural adjustment difficulties than those who perceived their parents to be marginal types. In the third set of analyses, years of residency, education, and income were found to correlate significantly with acculturation and cultural adjustment difficulties.

However, their protective stance has led to an 'Us and Them' phenomenon as evidenced in their narration of their experience. The way they arrange themselves as a theory group also plays out in an internal 'Us and Them' stance in that the Multicultural Theory group and the Lesbian Theory group are separate groups which are meant to bring diversity into the theory but are separated from each other and from the core group. An apparent consequence of the core group's 'arm's length' attitude toward the elements of diversity is minimal diversity content incorporated into the theory. The two interviewees who come from this outer tier were the ones who provided spontaneous criticism about the theory-making and the main grouping, and did not narrate themselves as members of the core group. A disadvantage of the internal and external layering is that The Hill Center grouping is theoretically isolated from other feminists and other concurrent Relational theorists. The core group seems reluctant to communicate their theory outside of their own ranks, and they seem to avoid outside influences. It is of note that the core members generally ignored the other concurrent Relational theorists in their reactionary orientation to the traditional theories in which they were all trained as was specifically pointed to in the spontaneous criticism of the two 'outside members.' Theory stagnation may be a significant consequence of the core group's theoretical internal and external isolation. Despite the disadvantages of their external and internal layering, their protective 'Us and Them' stance may be necessary for them to develop the early stages of a new feminist paradigm in psychology. Implications for theory development are discussed.

The analysis of the interviews fielded five categories with their individual subcategories and dimensions. They were: Cultural Distance, Political Consciousness, Cultural awareness, Cultural Continuity and Multicultural Identity. One important finding was that Armenian identity was defined as ""mind set"" or ""a feeling"" accentuated with strong feelings about the Armenian genocide. Another finding was that multicultural identity was related to an initial identification with one's own ethnicity.

The concept of quality of life was analyzed under a human ecological framework (self, family, and community), as well as a multi-method approach (participatory action-research, drama and psychodrama, mask-making and painting, surveys, interviews, content analysis, focus groups, and cooperative learning structures). Students conducted research on definitions of family and community quality of life by surveying: (a) their family members, (b) the governor and the mayor, as well as (c) members of community organizations. In addition, students worked under cooperative learning structures in which they defined these concepts themselves. Research participants belonged to various ethnic and age groups; thus, results were analyzed both from a multicultural and an intergenerational perspective. An instrument to measure empowerment and perceptions regarding quality of life was developed, based on modifications of various existing instruments. The results showed that students felt significantly (p <05) more empowered, that is, they felt an increased sense of importance as members of their community. This youth-initiated participatory action-research methodology is considered inter-disciplinary, and accurate and simple, as well as being attractive to youths. At the end of the project, students wrote a research report, which included their recommendations for ways to increase their community quality of life. Research results were also communicated by means of theater performances, using scripts written by the students. This project may be considered both an intervention and a prevention study. In this respect, in addition to constant interaction with the students (with the goal of increasing social awareness and empowerment), it also provided a prevention curriculum in which values of individual and social well-being were researched and developed by the youths. Beforehand, students were neither told, what the norms of quality of life were, nor what ethical values they should pursue. The knowledge generation process emerged from the bottom-up: students were both the creators and owners of those values.

The dimension of culture examined was the nature of human relations (Schein, 1992), which was measured using instruments based on Fiske's (1991) theory of elementary relational forms. Results indicate that the sex composition of the founding team affected both preferred and perceived norms for social interaction in the groups. In the laboratory, simulated organizations founded by women emphasized communal sharing and equality matching principles more, and authority ranking principles less, than did organizations founded by men, but the differences were small. The two naturally occurring organizations founded by all-female teams seemed to develop more consistent, unified cultures than the two organizations founded by mixed-sex teams, and both female-founded organizations strongly resisted attempts to change the culture. Disagreement about relational norms contributed to the break-up of one mixed-sex founding team, and to the firing of an early hire in the other organization founded by a mixed-sex team. In the laboratory, females in groups founded by women reached consensus about relational norms more quickly than did males in groups founded by men. Female newcomers also perceived the relational culture of their new organizations more accurately than male newcomers did, when accuracy was measured as agreement with established group members. Female newcomers in previously all-male groups judged themselves to be fitting in to their new groups better than male newcomers joining previously all-female groups. When newcomers arrived alone, they initially agreed more closely with the founders about relational culture than did newcomers arriving in a cohort. This tendency was strongest for newcomers who both arrived alone and were the only representative of their gender in the organization. The pattern of results is explained by a multicultural analysis of diversity in groups.

Little empirical research, however, has focused on the empowerment of social workers. This study integrates three bodies of literature--empowerment theories from social work, psychology and organizational studies, feminist-informed theories of power, and work on multicultural organization development--to formulate a social relationships approach to worker empowerment. The model comprises empowering processes, antecedents, outcomes and consequences. The multicultural dimensions are elaborated in two ways: one, taking a comparative approach to empowerment for African American women, White women and White men; and two, including race and gender discrimination as forms of workplace stress. Survey data from two national random samples of social workers were used to test the model. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that perceived control, understanding, workplace friendliness, recognition and decision autonomy were interrelated dimensions of worker empowerment. Next, regression analyses testing workplace social relationships as empowering processes showed supportive and undermining relationships with co-workers and supervisors form empowerment networks of varying complexity across the race-gender groups. Two clear differences were evident: women experience more negative influences on empowerment compared to White men, and only African American women experience negative supervisory influence. Finally, hierarchical regression analyses elucidated two distinct mediating effects of empowerment: one, a mediator in the job stress-strain relationship, especially for African American women; and two, a mediator between social relationships and strains, especially for White women. A social power analysis suggested that empowerment plays a particularly important role for African American women with consequences for direct service outcomes, job-related assessments and health strains. The study makes several contributions to organizational and empowerment theory and practice: an empirical operationalization of worker empowerment; mechanisms of how social relationships, work stress and empowerment affect direct service outcomes, job-related assessments and health strains; and an understanding of the importance of race and gender in studies of organizations and empowerment. Future theory development can expand the conceptualization of empowerment on four dimensions--competence, consciousness, community and change--and also explore the linkages among different levels of empowerment.

These girls were all Muslims, born and raised in the United States. However, their parents were immigrants from different countries. All of the girls, as part of a support group, engaged in dialogue which allowed them to affirm individual and collective identities. (EIlsworth, 1993). This study is positioned within the postmodern multicultural agenda of schooling. (Baker, 1977; Carlson, 1995; McCarthy, 1990; McLaren, 1995; Giroux, 1992). Analysis of the data reveals that the females lived bifurcated lives within the home and the school. They lived within the dominant culture and the culture of home which allowed them to be marginalized and different. (Said, 1978). Popular cultural representations of the Muslim ""Other"" as well as patriarchy in the home tended to reify their identities and encouraged them to lead bifurcated lives (Mernissi, 1991). One major conclusion of this study is that multicultural education must play a central role in allowing marginalized youth to cross identity borders, affirm their voices, and live multifaceted lives.

Research questions included: If organizations are multi-cultural, around what differences do subcultures form? What kind of subcultures emerge? How do subcultures interact with the dominant culture in an organization? The research questions were answered through a content analysis of data collected from field notes, artifacts, archival data, and interviews. Participants included many of Corda Institute's 449 employees in 1 of its 3 major divisions or its administrative and support staff. The results of this study indicated that Corda Institute is a multicultural organization, i.e., a number of different subcultures coexisting within a single organization. Three types of subcultures were identified around the 4 core cultural themes of collaboration, diversity, mission, and ongoing education. These subcultures include a functional/occupational subculture, the upper management subculture, and 4 enhancing subcultures--1 dealing with collaboration, diversity, mission and ongoing education. The first 2 subcultures actually form around difference resulting from function. The enhancing subcultures took shape around intensity or magnitude rather than an outright difference. With respect to interaction between the dominant culture and the identified subcultures, all 6 subcultures, as well as the dominant culture, utilize pluralism/acculturation as their process for acculturation, i.e., ""the ways in which two groups adapt to each other and resolve emergent conflict"" (Nahavandi & Malekzadeh, 1988, p. 82). The results of the study were explained in terms of the theory of organizational subcultures (Trice, 1993; Trice & Morand, 1991; Louis, 1985, 1990; Gregory, 1983; Cox, 1993; Sproull, 1981; Van Maanen and Barley, 1985; Bloor and Dawson, 1994) and acculturation models (Trice, 1993; Nahavandi & Malekzadeh, 1988; Cox, 1993; Simons, Vazquez, & Harris, 1993).

In response to the lack of linkage between multicultural research, personal construct research, and group work research, a study consisting of three parts was designed. First, an attempt was made to identify group leaders' cultural constructs and attitudes. Second, an attempt was made to investigate factors which contribute to successful leadership. Finally, group leaders' openness to experience was described. A descriptive case study design with qualitative and quantitative measures was utilized. Participants consisted of 30 group leaders, 15 men and 15 women, divided into three categories based on level of experience. For triangulation purposes, information was gathered from three sources: (a) CART (Cultural Attitudes Repertory Technique), a grid originated by Fukuyama and Neimeyer (1985); (b) 13 interview questions based on the principles used by Jimenez, Garcia, and Pearson (1995); and (c) NEO-PI, a personality inventory developed by Costa and McCrae (1985). Data analysis showed that while participant scores regarding differentiation and integration as well as openness to experience were high, there was a discernible pattern based on the level of professional and educational experience. In addition, there was consistency between participants' responses to the interview questions and their cultural constructs elicited while completing the CART. For example, master students seemed to describe examples of what they knew about the challenges and problems of transcultural individuals. Doctoral students emphasized analysis of differences. Experts focused on analysis as well as synthesis, evaluation, and interconnectedness among transcultural individuals. Implications of these results are discussed along with recommendations for future training and research.

The GDQ is a questionnaire targeting to assess the developmental profile of groups based on Wheelan's integrative model of group development (Wheelan, 1990, 1994). The review of the literature includes basic principles of small group development, major models of group development theories, and cross-cultural studies in the group development theories specifically in Japanese groups. The literature has generally concluded that groups develop through successive stages called successive stage theory. However, this theory has not been examined in different cultural settings. Japan known to be different cultural environment from that of U.S. is an appropriate choice to examine the universality of the group development theory. The researcher chose the GDQ, and attempted to develop a Japanese version of the instrument with the intention of creating a common tool for comparison between American and Japanese groups. The Group Development Questionnaire in Japanese (GDQ-J) was validated with the subjects of 158 workers from 6 Japanese companies in Tokyo. The construct validity of the GDQ-J was established with the factor analysis technique which clustered the questionnaire's 60 items into two major factors. The results are consistent with research predictions. The internal consistency of the scale proved to be reliable. Test-retest analysis established the reliability of the GDQ-J over time. Further, investigation of demographic variables found no significant correlations with the scores of the GDQ-J with the exception of educational level. The results indicated that the higher a respondent's level of education, the lower he/she tends to score on scales of dependency and conflict. Finally, the results suggested that both internal and external evaluation of the group productivity are correlated with the scores on scales of 3 trust/structure and work. Results were discussed regarding their application to cross-cultural studies in group development, and to design and implementation of training programs for Japanese and multicultural work groups. Finally, some recommendations for further research were made keeping in view the limitations of this study.

Eight women, between the ages of 33 and 56 who had lived in three differing cultures from between two to five years, were interviewed using the long interview. Transcripts were analyzed using the modified analytic inductive approach. Through informant categories and observer identified categories, the researcher determined that women go through a three phased process of confrontation, assessment and defining location which provide a platform from which to delve further into a given culture. In the confrontation phase, women experienced identity confusion, loss, and crisis. In the assessment phase, they assessed their experiences in culture. This assessment was a twofold process: assessing the self and assessing the self-in-experience. In the third phase, the women experienced need for location. Two types of location were determined: psychological location and functional location. Psychological location was a broad location in which the self was defined as ""an international""; ""a third culture person""; ""a multicultural"". Functional location was a subcultural group, either created by the informant or by some previously established group, such as women's clubs, international groups, etc. Operating in this subculture provided a reference group necessary to launch out into the host community to establish the self in country. When no subculture was found, women moved toward cultural marginalization or separation. Multiple cultured women's identity development reflected both negative and positive aspects. The negative experiences included loss of relationship and belonging; loss of place; culture shock; and crisis as to one's identity which lasted from several months to several years. The positive experiences of identity development included the development of greater human understanding; tolerance and open mindedness; an openness to others and cultural differences; a strong anti-racist attitude; and the ability to synthesize multiple cultural experiences into the tapestry of life.

Holland contends that individuals can be defined as one of six vocational personality typologies: realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, or conventional. Since 1980, more than one hundred cross-national studies in over 26 countries have reported some encouraging results. A total of one hundred and seventy Asian international students (n = 170) enrolled in three major universities in the Southeastern United States responded to three instruments--(a) Holland's Self-directed Search (SDS), (b) an empirical-based questionnaire designed specifically for this study that examined a number of social and career factors that influence career decisions (SCQ), and (c) a demographic questionnaire. Participants were of Chinese descent originating from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, or Singapore. Preliminary findings based on exploratory factor analyses suggested two potentially competing models comprised of four personality typologies and five personality typologies as possible alternatives to Holland's six-factor model. Item analyses of the SCQ revealed three significant factors underlying this instrument--(a) Holland's career interests, (b) professional exposure, and (c) career information. Using the Lisrel-VIII program, confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) revealed that the fit between the SDS data and the proposed four- and five-factor models as well as Holland's six-factor model was less than optimal to be considered as statistically robust models. Nonetheless, each of the three CFA models did account for a considerable portion of total variance. Factor intercorrelation indicated a substantial overlap between the enterprising and conventional personality typologies. Multiple analyses of variance using gender, academic classification, and type of major, examined group differences in relation to the three SCQ factors and Holland's assessment constructs of congruence and differentiation. Results suggested that participants enrolled in technical majors exhibited greater career interest congruence than their peers in nontechnical majors. Approximately half of the total participants expressed an academic major in agreement with their SDS primary typology. This lent some support for the cross-national concurrent validity of Holland's construct of congruence for facilitating career counseling with this group of Asian students. Findings of this study also pointed to a substantial overlap between the enterprising and conventional typologies. This similarity may reflect an entrenched cultural tradition of commerce and enterpreneurship perpetuated in Overseas Chinese families. The realistic, investigative, artistic, social, and enterprising-conventional (combined) typologies seem valid in differentiating the students' vocational orientation. Findings raised questions concerning the structural validity of Holland's existing model for use with this population of Asian students. However, Holland's model did account for a considerable portion of total variance, thus lending support that there may be a universal or multicultural aspect of the model which transcends the world of work in many cultures.

An improper education is one in which students are taught which characteristics are typical of people from other cultures, but do not receive the guidance needed to use the information wisely. The design and predictions of this study were drawn from previous research that examined the schema pointer + tag hypothesis. This hypothesis states that when people use schemata to remember information, certain types of memory errors are made. First, people have a better memory for atypical information. Second, people have no memory discrimination between very typical information presented to them and very typical information not presented to them. Third, as information becomes more atypical, people have better memory discrimination. Finally, people falsely remember typical information more often than atypical information. The methods used in previous research on the schema pointer + tag hypothesis were used in this study to test the effects of an improper education about multicultural issues. This was done by compiling information about people from minority cultures that researchers have reported describe the people of those cultures. A group of twelve subjects read this information, then generated descriptions of fictional characters. Another group of twelve subjects rated the descriptions of fictional characters as to how typical the descriptions were of their cultural group. Finally, this information was heard and read by forty subjects with the intent of retaining the information for later use. Subjects were then introduced (through audio recordings) to fictional characters from those cultures. After a distraction task and a review of the researched information, subjects were then given the task of recognizing which descriptions of the fictional characters they heard earlier.

The adolescents that have been studied were primarily from urban or metropolitan environments, and these studies did not factor in the influence of cultural context on variations in adolescent success strivings. This longitudinal investigation attempted to expand upon existing studies by not only focusing on a rural, southern high school sample, but also by allowing the students to generate their own criteria for defining success. A 12 category questionnaire, which was developed for this research project, and the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale for Children were administered on two occasions to the same group of subjects. The first study (T1) was conducted at middle adolescence, when participants were ninth graders; the second study (T2) was conducted at late adolescence during the twelfth grade. At T1, 149 students, ages 14-16 participated. Eighty were African American (AA); 54 were Caucasian (C). At T2, 152 students, ages 16-19 completed the assessment. Fifty-nine in this study were C and 75 were AA. At both T1 and T2, participants consistently identified three criteria when they generated their own success definitions: accomplishments/recognition, personal attributes and work/career. This was true across the variable of race though some variation was noted in comparison of gender-specific responses. The most frequently cited component of success, accomplishment/recognition, was described as setting and achieving goals being their best, working hard and achieving fame. Comparison of self-concept scores between T1 and T2 showed a significant increase in self-esteem across variables of race and gender. These data provide a profile of rural, southern adolescents viewed from a cultural and longitudinal perspective. The definitions generated by these adolescents can be valuable in t (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","perceptions of success during middle vs late adolescence, rural Black vs White adolescents, 3 yr study","*Achievement

The intellectual and multicultural levels of the participants were assessed in a pretest-posttest design using the Scale of Intellectual Development and the Multicultural Attitude Awareness Questionnaire. Analyses revealed that mean scores on the Multicultural Attitude Awareness Questionnaire and the standard scores on the Scale of intellectual Development for prospective teachers did increase from preassessment to postassessment. It appears that this change in scores was due to new information learned about multiculturalism, since no significant relationship was observed between the dependent variables (intellectual development and multicultural awareness) and the independent variable (instructional strategy). Of the six clusters on the Multicultural Attitude Awareness Questionnaire a positive and significant relationship was observed between all five instructional strategies and preservice teachers' personal attitudes associated with effective use of multicultural approaches in their classroom (Cluster 6).

A PAR paradigm was developed that would both identify existing barriers for families and provide opportunities for overcoming those obstacles through the research process. A total of 94 persons in the Chinese community were interviewed, including family members caring for a child with a disability and community members with no direct contact with a person with a disability. Results from the interviews show negative attitudes towards children with a disability grounded in cultural beliefs regarding a child's capacity to contribute to the family, a widespread use of traditional healers in conjunction with a family doctor or hospital, and a lack of knowledge on available community support agencies. Language barriers between service providers and families was also found to be a problem.

The primary objective of the Controlled Approach exercise is to discover the nature of one's own body response pattern to neutral, negative, and positive stimuli (C. Clarke, 1990; A. Pesso, 1988). The objective of the workshop is to heighten participant awareness about body cues that may signal possible countertransferential reactions to clients of difference, despite clinicians' efforts to be politically correct or objective in their work. In the laboratory setting of the workshop, practitioners begin to develop a tool for monitoring and using information from the body (not just the mind) to track the countertransferential stream for minimization of the possibility of acting out surreptitiously with a client of difference.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The relationship of locus of control to depression, anxiety, hostility, and physical health was assessed in a sample of multicultural college students. Powerful Others Health Locus of Control was correlated with depression, anxiety, hostility, and recent physical symptoms while Chance Health Locus of Control (CHLC) was correlated with all of the above as well as chronic physical symptoms and major health problems. When controlling for a variety of health risk factors (viz., age, sex, body mass, exercise, smoking, salt, alcohol, and caffeine), only CHLC remained significant in the physical health models. Results support the cognitive model of mental health which emphasize the importance of adaptive beliefs. Specifically, they suggest that issues about control are related to negative affect and indicate that the often-cited relationship of an external locus of control to depression and anxiety also holds for hostility. The findings do not, however, support the view that anxiety and depression are associated with different types of external locus of control but rather suggest a unified set of locus of control beliefs underlying the three types of negative affect. In addition, evidence is provided for the external validity of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) Scales with respect to mental health. Further, the results indicate that belief about one's health may play a significant role in one's physical health and that the health behavior model of the relationship between locus of control and physical health is insufficient to explain the relationship. As the Chance and Powerful Others MHLC scales were not related to health habits in this sample but were related to mental health (viz., depression, anxiety, and hostility), locus of control beliefs may be related to physical health via their relationship with mental health.

Edited Book",,"(from the jacket) Pair therapy is a relationship-oriented treatment modality that addresses the social difficulties encountered in growing up in today's world. This approach has been developed not only as a therapeutic intervention in day and residential treatment centers but also as a prevention method that can be used in public schools, day care centers, and other contexts. This volume meets the demand for an accessible, hands-on guide to the pair method. The theoretical foundations of the approach are also presented. The techniques described in the book model a relationship-building process between an adult professional and 2 children. This process replicates the social relations that happen naturally in healthy and happy interactions and long-term relationships among well-cared-for children in safe and secure communities. The book will be useful for a number of disciplines that deal with young children and adolescents in similar situations: social work, education, school and group therapy, and human development.

Comment/Reply","(from the chapter) K. Leung's review in this volume (1997) of the negotiation and reward allocation literature identified both the persisting problems and the beckoning opportunities that cross-cultural research in industrial and organizational psychology presents to researchers. The present chapter tries to realize some of those opportunities and demonstrates one approach for dealing with several of the problems. The 2 specific problems the previous chapter addressed were: the use of individualist measures for describing collective phenomena and the need to identify mediating variables that link broad cultural constructs to micro-level psychological variables.

The text provides a coherent critique and overview of environmental intervention congruent with the demands of such emergent areas as practice with personal social networks, empowerment practice, practice from a strengths perspective, and multicultural practice. It draws on the work of seminal contributors in social work practice and social science. The primary audience of this book is the great majority of social workers whose helping efforts extend to individuals, families, groups, and neighborhoods. Its primary aim is to examine each of these levels critically, through the prism of ""environment,"" and to offer practical suggestions for both assessment and intervention. The authors provide a conceptual framework for understanding environmentally oriented practice; explore its theoretical, historical and empirical underpinnings; and provide extensive information on environmental assessment and intervention, including assessment and intervention with personal social networks.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Discussing organizational ethics is challenging because of its politically and socially charged nature. This chapter enters that discussion with rather modest goals. Initially, we explore our current situation, briefly noting the problems this situation poses for our standard western, and now often international orientation to ethical discussions. Next, we look at various contemporary attempts to provide an adequate discourse on ethics. In doing so we demonstrate the difficulties we face when addressing particular problems in international business today. We examine and critique concepts such as social responsibility, silencing the marginalized and multicultural voices, privatized values, such as emotivism, and the potential for a universal value and ethical system with each theoretical territory, as well as within both a multicultural organizational context and an international business environment. Finally, we explore a dialogic or communicative basis for ethical discussions emerging out of feminist and postmodern social philosophies.

Their contribution can be considered particularly important and timely because, as they note, ""In an ever widening multicultural environment it is a rare practitioner who is not confronted, at least occasionally, with a client who comes from a different background than herself."" The authors underscore the challenges of doing cross-cultural therapy, and present arguments in support of their view that REBT and other cognitive-behavioral therapies represent the most appropriate forms of treatment for culturally diverse clients. They provide salient recomendations for deploying REBT with individuals whose cultural background differs from that of the therapist, and finally present the illustrative case of A.Z., a 32-yr-old man from the Indian subcontinent who was seen in therapy by the first author. The authors conclude this chapter by reminding the reader that developing sensitivity to culturally diverse clients is best viewed as an ongoing process. A list of useful articles and books for therapists interested in pursuing further relevant reading is included.

The new metaphor is of individuals relating as the sculptors while being part of the sculpture of multicultural relations.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In the 1st part of this chapter, the author outlines his interpretation of the phenomena and challenges we face in contemporary multiethnic and multicultural society, using developments in Brussels as a case in point. The author formulates what he feels must be dealt with throughout the school curriculum. The 2nd part of the chapter discusses 2 models of education, already operational, that seem able to perform the task sketched in the 1st part: the ""European School"" model and the ""bicultural and trilingual education"" system of Foyer, a nonprofit organization. The 3rd part of the chapter contains some tentative recommendations about the expansion of the systems discussed in the 2nd part.

It relates cultural differences in development to the problems and practice of child care. The book draws upon a theoretical and research base in cross-cultural psychology but presents the issues in practical terms leading to appropriate action. Its focus is on promoting the well-being of the children and those who care for them. Theory and practice are combined for everyday use by professionals in the field, including pre-school teachers, child care workers and psychologists working with children and adolescents in multicultural environments. The book concludes with a discussion of the effects of multicultural interaction and cultural change into the 21st century.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The aim of this chapter is to focus on two components of developmentally appropriate and culturally sensitive practice & curriculum in early childhood educational settings: (1) culturally responsive interaction in mutually directed activity, and (2) a pedagogy of caring. Mutually directed activity is intrinsic to culturally responsive interactions in which adults negotiate and share power with children by viewing them as equal participants in learning and by building on their culturally different ways of learning. A pedagogy of caring extends the need to value and accept children's knowledge, culture, and life experience by being caring and thoughtful in our relationships with them. A developmental framework is offered here that draws on the constructivist perspective of both Piaget and Vygotsky. I also draw on feminist epistemology, which acknowledges and values personal experience as a means for allowing more flexible interactions with others. Finally, I refer the reader to writings on the acquisition of cultural differences and various approaches to multicultural education in the United States.

To assist the reader in understanding some of these dilemmas, the contributors to this collection adopt an array of theoretical frameworks-that are all striking departures from traditional and more functional perspectives on diversity-including intergroup relations theory, critical theory, Jungian psychology, feminism, post-colonial theory, cultural history, postmodernism, realism, institutional theory, and class analysis. The authors examine a multitude of organizational situations in which the complications of diversity surface-many of which cross race, gender, ethnic, and other socially constructed boundaries. This book draws examples not only from the US, but also looks at situations from Canada, Britain, and the Middle East. This book is intended for students, scholars, managers, and researchers.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter is ultimately about reading. I first look at how children acquire the concepts associated with words. This suggests a view of mind, meaning and learning that stresses the situation and sociocultural nature of all of them and contains important implications for educational theory and practice. Then I turn to the nature of reading, both in terms of textual types (genres) and content, arguing that the model of concept acquisition sketched earlier is also a model of reading. Finally, I briefly discuss the implications of this model in the context of debates over the death of the literary canon and proposals for critical or resistant reading. I do this because I want to suggest how talk about the mind, far from precluding political discussion, invites it. The approach I take in this chapter is an attempt to render the notion of situated cognition (and situated word meaning) accessible and usable for readers from a variety of backgrounds while taking a particular perspective on it. My account is my version of a way to combine work on connectionism, concept formation, reflective practice, cultural models, and the sociology of science with an account of how children acquire the meanings of words and a sociocultural approach to language and literacy. The final goal, however, is to say something that is applicable to the practices and values of education in regard to multicultural classrooms and a multicultural world.

First, the authors have chosen the broad philosophical arena of constructivism to represent the approaches contained within the volume. Second, they are interested in addressing the core assumptions that are shared by the various psychological professions. The 3rd assumption is that the activities of these professionals extend well beyond the therapeutic activities of individual, group, and family counseling. The activities also encompass systematic inquiry into the behaviors of clients and principles of practice that might effectively promote therapeutic change. Furthermore, it involves the education, training, and supervision of those who aspire to enter these professions.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Given the ubiquitous and pervasive role of advertising in the world today-its ability to transcend political, social, cultural, and generational borders-it has become one of the world's most powerful and unifying types of discourse. The specific message of advertisers varies according to the context of reception; even universal messages will offer different readings if, for example, they are consumed in the global North or the global South. Nevertheless, although international political bodies such as the United Nations have not supplanted local political discourses, advertising is leading the way in creating the cultural conditions for the so-called global village. The caveat to this argument, however, is that although advertisers have made great inroads in globalizing their message, much of the traditional thematic content of actual advertisements continues to depend on the appeal of the normative White American or European subject. The clothing company Benetton has set out to change this. By marketing cultural difference, Benetton is showing its pioneering corporate spirit by opening the texts of advertising to include a broader range of potential consumers.

The contributors hail primarily from the fields of education and psychology but draw from the arenas of critical race theory, feminism, cultural studies, queer theory, and postcolonial thinking to argue that White identity, class, and sexuality are essential sites for studying racism. The opening section explodes the concept of Whiteness by examining how it is embodied and institutionalized in schools and workplaces. Contributors ""out"" their institutions in order to reveal how racism is firmly established in institutional structures, policies, relationships, and identities. Other essays tackle the privileges associated with Whiteness; pro-White racism; White, working class men's narratives; how Whiteness is embedded in intimacy; and the implications of Whiteness in print and media. The book concludes with a look at the possibilities that lie within multiracial ethnic coalition work.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter explores the possibility of rethinking the issue of multiculturalism with reference to the lives of young men growing up in culturally plural urban contexts in London, England. It looks at the connections between White working class masculinities, multiculture and the expression of racism. Particularly focusing on the impact that Black cultural forms have had on working class culture, this chapter explores the tensions between the multicultural resonances within the lives of these young men and the emergence of new and complex racialised hierarchies. The existence of an interlocked dualism of 'fear and desire' in White constructions of Black masculinity is an essential feature of the author's argument. With this in mind, he explores how the fear and desire couplet manages White identifications with Black people in South London. The referred material is drawn from an ethnographic study of racism in young working class people's lives conducted in 2 post-war housing developments between 1985 and 1989. The enthographic work should be seen as produced through a dialogue with a White male fieldworker in his early 20s.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In this chapter, the term ""minority groups of color"" is used to refer to 4 groups in the US: Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans. We begin discussion of each group with a brief historical paragraph or two, followed by a section examining selected areas of mental health risk, and conclude with a review of utilization of mental health services that includes issues of diagnosis and treatment. Increased attention to cultural diversity over the past 2 or 3 decades has forced some reevaluation of the manner in which the mental health professions have traditionally dealt with members of minority groups. Perhaps most marked is the shift from an intrapsychic stance to greater appreciation of the importance of ecological-systems influences. The ""melting pot"" ideology as the sine qua non of acculturation is being replaced by more acceptance of a pluralistic, multicultural society. Unfortunately, the Euro-American belief system continues to dominate our thinking, and more often than not it has negative impacts on the members of minority groups of color. The authors seek to illuminate some of the many ways this occurs.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) This book introduces a model for intellectual assessment-a bio-ecological approach-and a model for psychotherapy-the MULTI-CMS (Multicultural/Multimodal/Multisystems) approach. The principal objective of these models is to help mental health professionals more accurately assess and treat individuals from various ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds. The MULTI-CMS approach allows the therapist to view the world through the lenses of the client. The theoretical bases for the MULTI-CMS model originated from research done in cross-cultural psychology and cross-cultural mental health with ethnic minorities in the US and people who come from colonized systems around world. As such, this model has 3 categories where change can be effected: individual, institutional, and societal. In other words, this model seeks to empower the client through interactions with these various systems. Moreover, individual and societal goals focus on the elimination of the impediments to the development of a true multicultural society in which each person's individuality is respected. Therefore with this model, the diversity of the client is viewed as a catalyst to the development of the therapist.

Factor analysis of compliance resistance items indicates that students reported more resistance with increasing age, and ratings of refusal and comparison strategies increased with grade level. Reported resistance, refusals, and comparison resistance strategies were rated as less likely in response to a liked teacher and in response to prosocial strategies. Collectivist orientation negatively correlated with reported resistance, refusals, and comparison resistance strategies. Results suggest that a child's cultural orientation may have a constructive impact on a teacher's ability to manage the classroom.

All were followed-up for 1 yr. 40% of Ss in the intervention group, but none in the referent group, were judged to have PTSD. In the intervention group, positive significant correlations were found between the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, and SCID-DSM-III-R, Axis I PTSD. Experience of trauma influenced the ill-health in the psychometric indices, and the psychometric indices correlated negatively with present and optimal functioning. A targeted trauma approach toward multicultural psychiatric patients using a multidisciplinary team and validated psychometric tools provided sensitive and accurate diagnostic information for this group.

This is accomplished by clarifying origins and offering details on the current status of these 2 distinct positions. The author attempts to illuminate what is an intense debate, but one often lacking focus and clear definitions. This is done by discussing (a) the origins of important stances, (b) problems with simplistic reductions to 2 extremes, (c) dubious extrapolations, and (d) perspectives for science education that strive for an even-handed approach to positions on the nature of science and the nature of learning in a multicultural society. Using both historical and philosophical interpretations of the issues, it is concluded that current conceptions are oversimplified by some who promote extremes of both relativistic and strict hypothetico-deductive or inductive models related to what should be learned and what counts as science.

This study used a cross-culture design to examine the universality and uniqueness of educational value orientations between American and Chinese teachers in the subject domain of physical education. Physical education teachers from six American school districts and four Chinese districts completed the revised Ennis-Value-Orientation Inventory in their in-service workshops. Their responses were analyzed using chi-square statistics and a multivariate analysis of variance nested model. Results demonstrated that Disciplinary Mastery and Self-actualization value orientations were valued by both American and Chinese teachers, indicating that the two value perspectives may not be subject to the influence of different cultures. But Chinese teachers showed higher preferences in Learning Process and Ecological Integration values, while American teachers valued Social Responsibility orientation highly. Findings suggest that clarifying educational values in different cultures may be an initial step towards developing a core value base for an education for all.

Using quantitative and qualitative methods, the extent and character of the portrayal of Blacks and Black-White interaction between 1937 and 1993 is described. Results indicate the portrayal of Black characters over time is nonlinear and can be divided into reasonably distinct phases: declining representation from the late 1930s through the late 1950s, nearly zero representation from that point through 1964, a dramatic increase from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, and a leveling off after 1975. The depiction of intimate, egalitarian, interracial interaction and the portrayal of Black adults as focal characters are rare. Findings also suggest that gains in multicultural portrayals have not been maintained consistently across the different sets of children's books, with prize-winning books more likely to depict Blacks. These trends are linked to gatekeeping activities and to strains in Black-White relations in the larger society. When African American challenges to the dominant societal norms are strongest, Blacks virtually disappear from U.S. children's picture books.

The authors tested 2 competing hypotheses, similarity-attraction and similarity-differentiation, among samples from 6 ethnic groups (English-Canadian, French-Canadian, Jewish, Indian, Algerian, and Greek) in Greater Montreal, Canada. 605 Ss (mean age 42.08 yrs) were interviewed by means of an individually administered structured interview procedure conducted by co-ethnic interviewers. Each S was asked to indicate the extent to which he/she would be willing to associate with members of the other 5 ethnic groups, and how similar the other groups were to one's own group. The pattern of relationship observed between social distance and similarity supported the similarity-attraction hypothesis. The relationship was particularly strong when minority groups were rated. Possible interpretations of this finding and implications for culturally diverse societies are discussed.

Hostility toward tests of intelligence is understood to be based on the perception that such instruments have been decisive in placing ethnic and linguistic minority students in ineffective educational placements. Supporting the continued use of intelligence tests requires that these instruments and the notion of intelligence itself must be shown to contribute substantially to the educational success of all students. False solutions to this problem, such as banning intelligence testing, use of technically unsound practices, or the adoption of alternative assessment approaches are cautioned against. The need to acknowledge that individual differences exist is stressed, and educationally meaningful approaches to instruction are noted. The educational utility of intelligence tests is emphasized as the critical issue associated with assessing multicultural students.

The extent to which these new developments have translated to improvements in service delivery, however, remains unclear. At issue is the realization that despite new and better instruments for measuring intellectual abilities, the role of IQ tests in the service delivery process remains markedly similar to that of 30 years ago. The purpose of the present article, then, is to evaluate the extent to which today's newer IQ tests represent an improvement over their historical predecessors, the Binet and the Wechsler scales, in terms of the potential for improved educational and psychological service delivery. Discussion is organized using 3 conceptually relevant criteria: theoretical foundations, psychometric integrity, and implications for a multicultural society. It is concluded that despite advances in psychometric science and test development, the limitations of today's best instruments remain enmeshed in social debate.

Two of the most important schools defined by their employment of an ethical logic are feminist psychology and multicultural therapy, both of which offer ""ethico-therapeutic"" treatment modalities to clients perceived to be suffering from psychological wounds caused by some kind of power inequity. Essential to the success of such therapy for clients is the demand by psychologists for changes not only from clients, but from the general society. The authors conclude that the continued development of ethical discourses within psychology may help to meet many of the challenges to psychological well-being in the postmodern era.

Six seniors, 2 juniors, and 1 sophomore, representing White, African American, and Hispanic cultures, committed themselves to this project. This chapter presents an interpretive account of how these students used ethnographic research methods to explore cultural diversity in their school and community. It portrays the process of the study from the the author's perspective as the teacher, acting as facilitator and active participant in the project. Thus, the chapter is both ethnographic and autoethnographic. I include my voice as well as the student participants' voices as an integral part of the account of the project.

The study focuses on the issue of secondary school teachers and students from one culture reading and responding to works from other cultures. What distinctive characteristics of reading and response exist for students from different cultural groups? How do teachers accomplish the aims of teaching multicultural literature? How should a teacher deal with the cultural differences among readers? The importance of research such as this is its contribution to determining which educational programs serve to best educate people for intellectual development without destroying their cultural heritage and cultural pride, and which programs best uphold the diverse strengths of our pluralistic society.

Through the use of qualitative participatory action research methods, the participants in this study critically reflected on their understandings of multicultural education and their positions as white student teachers involved in a teacher education program. The participants were invited to be researchers about their daily lives, to pose problems that arose from the complexities of their own racial identities, and to develop realistic solutions for dealing with racism in their classrooms. Through initial one-to-one interviews, and during 8 2-hr group sessions, the participants were provided with opportunities to view themselves as white (an experience that was relatively new to them). It also provided them with a challenging and highly provocative way to view their roles as white teachers.

It is suggested that the way to manage this conflict is to develop skills to assess the client's worldview and use counseling approaches that match that perspective.

However, racial identity for both groups was not significantly related to multicultural case conceptualization ability. Furthermore, self-reported multicultural competence was not found to be significantly related to multicultural case conceptualization ability. However, supervisors' instruction to focus on multicultural issues was significantly related to conceptualizations of a multicultural treatment strategy.

Although some have argued that it is a much more socially acceptable category of exceptionality, others have indicated that it is a dumping ground for students for whom the traditional educational system has failed. The authors argue that for culturally diverse students, their problems in the traditional educational system have been multidimensional; they have been frequently misidentified, misassessed, miscategorized, misplaced, and misinstructed. Based on this argument, the authors state that preservice training must address whether culturally different students really have learning disabilities or learning problems emanating from within and when they have learning problems, if they are appropriately identified, tested, and taught by well-trained culturally sensitive practitioners.

It is noted that Fowers and Richardson appear to have overlooked theoretical work already taking place in multicultural discourses that parallels their own hermeneutic proposal. Noticeably absent from Fowers and Richardson's discussion are distinctions drawn in more sophisticated multicultural theories between ""emic,"" or culturally specific, values and the ""etic,"" universal values on which normative models of mental and social health might be based. Measured by its attempts to transcend the subtle forms of ethnocentrism it reveals to be implicit within multiculturalism, Fowers and Richardson's hermeneutic proposal may not have been hermeneutical enough.

Unfortunately, a lack of structural thinking and a focus on written and spoken texts, or social constructions, leads to deficits in Fowers and Richardson's arguments. As useful as a hermeneutic position may be in certain psychological contexts, it must be supplemented by a critical-theoretical perspective on social issues that can challenge the status quo of social power. And it is particularly necessary for a psychology that seeks to articulate the societal mediatedness of the individual to link psychological thinking with analyses of structural domination.

Ss were grouped according to their cultural origins and socioprofessional levels. Their representations were assessed via open questions before and after the teaching program. The teaching program reinforced preexisting representations in those Ss socioculturally nearest the teachers; it had a weak impact on those furthest removed from the teachers. The Ss, however, did not differ on back pain prevalence. Results showed a different impact of a primary prevention teaching, suggesting that Ss' representations, along with their determinants, should not be overlooked when discussing risk factors or adherence to teaching or treatment.

At the same time, psychologists in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are debating how to incorporate the best of Western psychology without betraying their cultural values and identities. Most representative of this new approach in the United States is community psychology, a contemporary example of which is the School of the Future project (W. H.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Physiological, cognitive, affective, and developmental sociocultural risk factors for perpetrating sexual aggression are identified. Feminine and multicultural socialization may serve as protective factors against these risk factors because both forms of socialization emphasize empathy and sexuality in the context of committed relationships. It is proposed that feminist and multicultural education across the developmental span may constitute methods of reducing and preventing the development of sexually aggressive behavior. However, feminist and multicultural approaches may have limited impact without greater acceptance within societal power structures, including psychology. The authors call for psychologists interested in reducing sexually aggressive behavior to become better informed and experienced with feminist and multicultural approaches. They also suggest that it may be time for all persons in society to become competent in multiple domains.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Patterns of alcohol use are affected by culture and history and intertwined with the rhythms of work life. The 20th century economic shift toward industrial and service jobs coupled with the increasing presence of women in the workplace has revolutionized US women's domestic and public roles, and these changes have impacted their drinking behavior. In addition, in a multicultural society like the US, subcultures, ethnic groups, socioeconomic classes, and even job categories have their own sets of gendered drinking norms. Patterns of alcohol use among women can be better understood with consideration of intricate interactions among gender, ethnicity, class, employment, and alcohol consumption. Stepping up to the need to learn more about these factors, the authors have reviewed literature about ethnic, class, occupational, and gender influences on women's workplace-related drinking. This report on that review will show both the complexity of the phenomenon and the inconsistent, incomplete nature of existing information, as well as pointing out directions for future research. The authors begin with a general discussion of women and workplace drinking.

The starting point in arguing for this claim is that post-modernism is philosophical scepticism. This scepticism is consistent with Jacques Derrida's post-modern view of justice, a view that opposes domination and that privileges hesitancy in imposing solutions. A valuable implication is to utilize what is described as the ""in-between"". Post-modern scepticism, justice as hesitation and acting in the in-between can sound antithetical to good organizational management, because the modernist view celebrates the human capacity to know, decisive action and hierarchical leadership. On the contrary, the post-modern perspective opens up prospects in an age where non-hierarchical and multicultural interactions are useful.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Affirming Diversity: The Sociopolitical Context of Multicultural Education by Sonia Nieto (1996). Multicultural education is a concept enjoying wide popularity in educational circles, but its definition is elusive. In Affirming Diversity, Nieto suggests a conceptualization of multicultural education that requires broad-based school reform and addresses four potential stumbling blocks to school success: racism and discrimination, ways in which schools are structured, cultural impacts on learning, and language diversity. In addition to summarizing the current research base, giving the reader general understandings as to how students are affected by school practices, Affirming Diversity adds to the literature with 12 case studies of individual high school students, underlining and making concrete the issues discussed. Laid out in textbook format, this book is intended to be used in classes for teachers in training, experienced teachers, and administrators who are or will be in positions to make changes in the ways schools serve the needs of students who increasingly represent a variety of cultural backgrounds. Affirming Diversity works well as a teaching text and should initiate lively discussion in classroom settings. Its analysis of the issues in multicultural education is thorough and offers new ways of thinking about school reform. The case studies that allow us to hear the voices of young people from many backgrounds provide new information and would be useful to those more generally interested in issues of cultural diversity in or out of school settings.

Past research has focused on preparing managers to successfully expatriate to foreign assignment and repatriate back to the United States. The high failure rate and general lack of effectiveness of many expatriate managers may be attributed to not having a cultural match between the assignment and the leadership style of the expatriate.

Reviews the book ""Depression-Theories and Treatments: Psychological, Biological, and Social Perspectives"" by Arthur and Ruth Schwartz (see record 1993-97872-000). To appreciate the intended breadth of coverage of depression by this volume it is illustrative to examine the organization of the book. The book consists of 21 chapters divided into five parts. Part 1 consists of chapters examining definitions, symptoms, and the diagnosis of depression. Part 2 has eight chapters dealing with various biological aspects of depression and biological treatments. Part 3 deals with psychological theories and treatments and includes chapters on psychodynamic approaches, interpersonal approaches, behavioral approaches, and cognitive and cognitive-behavioral approaches to depression. Part 4 consists of only one chapter that discusses what the authors term a unified approach to treating depression. Finally, Part 5 presents contemporary issues in depression and includes chapters on gender and depression; depression and aging; depression in children, adolescents, college students, couples, and families; and cross-cultural aspects of depression. The book evidences several strengths, those neglected topics, such as multicultural issues in depression and depression in childhood and adolescence. Despite these strengths, on the whole the book does not succeed well in its stated intent. Any book that attempts such broad coverage runs the risk of presenting only superficial information, and indeed it is here that the deficits of the volume are most glaring.

Paniagua sets out general guidelines for the assessment and treatment of multicultural groups, touching on such subjects as the development of the therapeutic relationship, levels of acculturation, the use of translators, extended family, and the overdiagnosing of multicultural groups.

The past two decades have seen marked increase in the study of interpersonal relationships, with articles on relationship formation and family dynamics featuring regularly across a range journals. However, for all this scholarly endeavor, the study of the family has remained firmly rooted in contemporary North America, with researchers rarely considering a wider cultural variability in relationship practices or their historical antecedents. In this introductory text (see record 1995-97341-000), the 14 contributors make an important attempt to redress this imbalance and in doing so aim to challenge readers' assumptions and prejudices about the modern family worldwide. Overall, the authors can be adjudged to have succeeded in this task, and there are indeed many strengths to this book. The reviewer suggests that no introductory text is perfect for every audience, and this text is written by (macro) sociologists primarily for sociology students. The reviewer indicates though, that this is a good text and a salutary reminder for those working in the family relations area as to the diversity of families throughout the world as well as the inaccuracy of many of our stereotypes about families in other cultures.

Reading this volume (see record 1995-97230-000) prompted in the reviewer an unintended comparison with one written by J. A. McGeoch nearly a half century ago. Geoch's book was based on empirical evidence and interpretations of research on learning available at the time. Conceptualizations, threaded throughout the present volume, contrast dramatically with the research of the earlier era. Emerging concerns (e.g., expertise, machine learning) are continually interwoven throughout the major topics of the book. Interesting generalizations contribute to an understanding beyond a simple recounting of evidence. Appropriate links are made to historical and philosophical references. Reminders that learning is not independent of personal, developmental, cultural, and multicultural contexts include discussion of culture, disabilities, gifted people, and capabilities in senescence. Of more general interest are discussions of cultural and developmental factors that account for such outcomes as misconceptions, scientists' difficulty in accepting new ideas, and the reasons why some things such as a native language and rules of social behavior are easy to learn. This volume would provide a comprehensive introduction for novices and a useful update for advanced students.

It is argued that what is lacking from this growing body of literature on cultural psychology is a well developed framework that is best articulated from a single voice. ""Multicultural Assessment Perspectives for Professional Psychology"" (see record 1993-98391-000) develops such a perspective for practitioners who conduct psychological assessment. The fact that psychological assessment is the sole focus of the text is one important contribution. The book is not without its limitations. Two come to mind. Case examples of how the proposed approach has been used with actual clinical cases would have been most helpful. A second limitation concerns the etic versus emic model. Despite the limited model of cultural competence in assessing people of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, this book has much to offer. It is useful for any academic who teaches assessment courses, both those who cover mainstream approaches and those who cover the assessment of diverse cultural groups. The book is also a valuable resource for any student or practitioner who wants to achieve some level of awareness of the current thinking and research concerning multicultural assessment. Given the cultural, racial, and ethnic diversity of the United States, this should be most, if not all, students and practitioners. Overall, Multicultural Assessment serves the field of professional psychology well by challenging us to integrate a much-needed multicultural perspective in psychological assessment.

""Counseling and Development in a Multicultural Society (2nd ed.)"" (see record 1993-97425-000) is designed as a comprehensive text for a course in multicultural counseling or psychotherapy. It is written for trainees in various mental health-related professions, such as counselors, psychologists, and social workers. The intention is to provide trainees in the mental health professions with a broad knowledge base and the ingredients of working with individuals who are culturally and racially different. The content of the book may also be relevant for a crosscultural issues course in a teacher education program. One area that has not been adequately addressed by Axelson is the theories and research on racial identity development. Racial identity development is a major area of research in the multicultural literature, but it is only briefly mentioned in the chapter on work and career development. This volume is a good comprehensive text for a course in cross-cultural counseling. Reading through the text will help trainees in counseling and psychotherapy become more sensitive to cultural, social, economic, and political issues that affect the well-being of individuals. In general, this book is easy to read and the organization of the content is well thought out. One major limitation of this volume is that, in attempting to be comprehensive, there is a general lack of depth. As one reads through the text, it is easy to remember many patches of ideas and concepts. Trainees who are interested in a more substantial examination of the multicultural counseling literature will have to seek other sources.

Review of The Masculine Self by Christopher T. Kilmartin (see record 1995-97234-000), Masculinity Reconstructed: Changing the Rules of Manhood-At Work, in Relationships, and in Family Life by Ronald F. Levant, A New Psychology of Men edited by Ronald F. Levant and William S. Pollack (see record 1995-97524-000), and Growing Up Male: The Psychology of Masculinity by B. Mark Schoenberg (see record 1993-98512-000). The above four volumes have been published within the past 24 months. All of these are indications that increasing amounts of time, interest, and energies are being devoted to the phenomenological experiences associated with being male in the 1990s. The objective of this comparative analysis is to examine these volumes from a multicultural feminist perspective. The Kilmartin text marginalizes the discussion of multicultural issues into several chapters. For example, there is a chapter focusing on ethnic minority issues and masculinity among African American and Mexican American men. Additionally, issues related to sexual orientation are discussed primarily in the chapter focusing on male sexuality. Unfortunately, Kilmartin has neglected to fully integrate multicultural issues systematically throughout the text. Some unique features of this text include the presentation of up-to-date information, summaries at the end of each chapter, boxes that highlight and explore relevant issues for the reader, an appreciation and acknowledgment of the relationship between the reconstructed masculinity and femininity constructs. This text is particularly well suited to undergraduate students in courses such as men's studies and sex roles and gender. The Levant and Kopecky volume is geared primarily toward the lay public more than toward helping professionals-in-training. The volume does a credible job of exploring the impact of contextual influences (at work, in family life, and in close relationships) on the expression of masculinity. Unfortunately, multicultural issues are ignored throughout this volume. The structure of this volume is centered around the presentation of beliefs that men hold, the traits men consider worth preserving and celebrating, the main problem areas men encounter, and the strategies (e.g., the development of ""emotional intelligence"") men should consider once they have decided to reconstruct masculinity. The Levant and Pollack edited volume has the most to offer its audience of professionals-in-training concerning contextual and multicultural influences as they pertain to the reconstructed masculinity construct. The book is organized into the following four sections: theory, research, applications, and varieties of masculinity. Schoenberg's volume is geared primarily toward an undergraduate student population. It is devoid of multicultural content and gives only minimal attention to the impact of contextual influences on the expression of masculinity. The relationship between the constructs of masculinity and femininity are briefly explored, but this discussion serves more to inhibit dialogue between the men and women than to promote it. These volumes clearly are designed to make contributions to the burgeoning literature focusing on the reconstructed masculinity construct. For that construct to be ecologically valid, there is a pressing need for (a) the full integration of multicultural issues into the discussion, (b) the systematic incorporation of the impact of contextual influences on the expression of masculinity, and (c) the recognition and appreciation of the relationship between the reconstructed masculinity and femininity constructs as well as the desire to maintain a dialogue with women concerning the impact of the reconstructed masculinity construct on the daily lives of women.

An overview of the table of contents reveals a strength of Vacc, DeVaney, and Wittmer's edited textbook (see record 1995-97249-000) on counseling diverse populations: unusually diverse populations are included. The 12 groups covered in the book range from expected cultural groups (i.e., Asian American) to groups whose inclusion evokes a pleasant surprise (i.e., single parents). In size, the groups range from large, familiar groups (i.e., the elderly) to small groups obscure to most (i.e., the Amish). Unfortunately, the stimulating diversity of groups included in this book is matched by a wide diversity in the quality of the various chapters. The most disappointing aspect of the text, however, is the lack of a compelling argument about why the study of diverse populations is so important for today's counselor. The reviewer concludes that because of these weaknesses, this book is not sufficient as a solitary text for a multicultural counseling course.

The reviewer highly recommends it for those teaching multicultural courses, as well as those needing to understand the emotional demands on their students who take those courses.

Multicultural issues are introduced and discussed in their proper context. Bacharach was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the last chapter titled ""The World of Psychology: Multicultural Issues and Applications."" The book has several appealing features. The authors' writing style is attractive and, true to claims in the Preface, they have achieved a nice balance between discussions of psychological principles and the application of those principles. The reviewer also liked the way that they have handled ""pop"" psychology issues. They let the air out of many of these balloons, but they let the air out gently. The authors have also squarely faced a number of controversial issues without flinching from, or doing end runs around, the data.

A text for working with culturally diverse children and adolescents is needed to guide professionals who are faced with increasingly diverse clinical populations. My initial enthusiasm for a book such as this is tempered by the difficulties within the field outlining a unified treatment approach that would address diverse cultures. This book (see record 1994-98434-000) offers a stress model that attempts to unite the various cultures living in the United States. Other than stress, which many American children suffer notwithstanding their cultural and economic background, and being different from the mainstream culture, there may be little common ground. Some interesting clinical vignettes that illustrate unique cultural issues are presented. One cannot, of course, blame these authors for the limitations of a multicultural model. More empirical research needs to be conducted on cultural issues ranging from assessment and diagnosis to treatment. Given the paucity of such research and the lack of alternative approaches, this text can sensitize professionals working with diverse populations. Beyond that, I remain doubtful regarding the contributions of this multicultural text. The effort spent to design a unified treatment approach would perhaps be better spent recognizing the depth, impact, and uniqueness of the differences themselves and understanding that each of us has particular cultural factors serving as both advantages and disadvantages, depending on the social context. To be competent in working with diverse cultures, as in any other clinical domain, additional training, study, and consultation with professionals from those fields is needed. As an introduction to sensitivity training, the text is well-written and would be of interest. However, a traditional therapist would have to go beyond this text to be competent in working with culturally diverse populations.

Respondents reported that (1) issues of ethnicity and cultural diversity were not adequately addressed in their clinical training, (2) their ethnicity positively and negatively affected their work with clients, and (3) nonminority colleagues view their ethnic minority peers as less competent than nonminority therapists, or as only able to work with ethnic minority clients.

Results demonstrated that a greater degree of identification with the mainstream Hong Kong Chinese was correlated with continuity of parental and peer identification, where greater emphasis was on peers, and with self-esteem. Identification with the modern Oriental peoples was also correlated with continuity of intergenerational identification, but with a greater emphasis on parents, and with identity diffusion. Identification with the traditional Chinese was correlated solely with identification with the parental generation and with identity diffusion. Identification with the Western world was correlated solely with the peer generation and with self-esteem. Identification with the developing peoples was correlated with identity diffusion and inversely correlated with self-esteem.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) ""The Multicultural Imagination"" is a challenging inquiry into the complex interrelationship between our ideas about ""race"" and color and the unconscious. Michael Vannoy Adams takes a fresh look at the contributions of psychoanalysis to a question that affects all individuals who try to establish an effective personal identity in the context of their received ""racial"" identity. Adams argues that ""race"" is just as important as sex or any other content of the unconscious, drawing on clinical case material from contemporary patients for whom ""race"" or color is a vitally significant social and political concern that impacts on them personally. He does not assume that racism or ""colorism"" will simply vanish if we psychoanalyze them, but shows how a non-defensive ego and a self-image that is receptive to other-images can move us toward a more productive discourse of cultural differences.

The . . . contributors to this reader fight fire with fire, using mass media communication such as newspaper, magazine, and TV journalism, as well as communication research and scholarship to ensure full inclusion of women and minorities in all areas. A platform for feminist discourse on topics such as the military academy, pornography, grassroots communication, culturally diverse organizations, and courtroom justice, each chapter voices issues important to women entering the 21st century. Brought together, these voices clamor thunderously for definitive and positive social change.

The influences of these measures on Ss' life space (LS) were examined. Results show a difference of LS between Japanese-Bolivian and Bolivian junior high school students. The LS of Bolivian junior high school students was differentiated to Bolivia but not to foreign countries. In contrast, the LS of Japanese-Bolivian junior high school students was not differentiated to Bolivia but to Japan. Two social contexts that could be associated with this difference are discussed: the relationship between Japanese-Bolivians and Bolivians in the colony, and the inflow of Japanese mass media into the colony.

Findings suggest that despite the children's initial difficulty with English and the differences between home and school cultures, they were a cheerful group who, in their unique ways, are coming to terms with their bilingualism and biculturalism within a multicultural situation. The majority of children, however, could not read or write in their mother tongue. On the whole, the children liked their school and were aiming to continue their education to enter professional occupations. The children were developing a bicultural outlook by learning to speak their mother tongue and having at least some knowledge of the teachings of their faiths.

Two case studies provide a picture of the situation in Australian universities. One case is that of an older and larger institution recently formed as a multicampus university by amalgamations and with its main campus in the inner city of Australia's 2nd-largest city. The contrasting case is of a newer, suburban university in one of the smaller capital cities. The challenges facing university counselling services in the future include the continuing pressure for greater accountability, the increasing demands of a multicultural clientele, the temptation to take on a wider range of tasks than can be sustained, and its obverse, the risk of overspecialization.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Investigated data on musical dislikes from the 1993 General Social Survey by linking literatures on taste, racism, and democratic liberalism, and whether people use cultural taste to reinforce symbolic boundaries between themselves and categories of people they dislike. Contrary to P. Bourdieu's (1984) prediction, musical exclusiveness decreases with education. Also, political tolerance is associated with musical tolerance, even controlling for educational attainment, and racism increases the probability of disliking genres whose fans are disproportionately non-White. Tolerant musical taste, however, is found to have a specific pattern of exclusiveness: Those genres whose fans have the least education-gospel, country, rap, and heavy metal-are also those most likely to be rejected by the musically tolerant. Broad familiarity with music genres is also significantly related to education. It is suggested that cultural tolerance constitutes multicultural capital as it is unevenly distributed in the population and evidences class-based exclusion.

In Experiment 1, 70 Australian undergraduates received either $1 or $2 to work on an intrinsically rewarding puzzle, with or without knowledge of what amount other participants were receiving. A comparison of participants with a no-payment control showed that participants exhibited significantly reduced intrinsic motivation (seconds spent interacting with the puzzle during a free-choice period) when they knew that they were being under- or overpaid. In Experiment 2, 126 occupationally matched Australian workers receiving wages equal to, lower than, or higher than those of counterparts reported that their level of job satisfaction and whether they would stay on the job, change jobs, or retire, if given the financial opportunity. Compared with equitably paid workers, employees who felt they were under- or overpaid reported lower job satisfaction and greater readiness to change jobs. The results provide experimental support for double demotivation, which is relevant not only to international development cooperation but also to Western enterprise bargaining, merit pay, and minority groups in the multicultural workplace.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) The central theme of the 3rd edition of ""Working with Parents and Families of Exceptional Children and Youth: Techniques for Successful Conferencing and Collaboration"" is that educators and related professionals, including classroom teachers, must be involved in helping parents and families to contend with the various issues they routinely confront when raising and living with a child who has an exceptionality. Parent and family conferencing and collaboration is a subject area that requires both cognitive understanding and related experiences. Thus, while readers should recognize that parent and family involvement is based on a theoretical, clinical, and empirical foundation, they must also accept that the development of skills necessary for meaningful relationships with parents and families requires appropriate experiences and practice. Accordingly, readers are strongly encouraged to view the included role-playing activities and exercises as an integral and basic component of this book. Indeed, the adage that we learn best by doing presents an underlying premise of this book.

The countries chosen for inclusion in the book consist of nations which participated in the authors' international study of multicultural education. In addition, other countries which did not respond to the survey requests were also included in order to provide a solid sampling of nations on all continents. An attempt was made to include both developing nations and industrialized countries, as well as nations with differing political systems and varying religious perspectives. In this study, [multicultural education] was defined as educational strategies which attempt to prepare youth to function constructively in a changing pluralistic society by providing teachers and students with the capacity to diagnose and work through racial, ethnic, cultural, and gender issues and misunderstandings, prejudice, and racial fears. Moreover, it also consists of educational experiences which positiviely reflect and embody the diverse nature of the national and international community.

Treatment of these in turn, plus attention to a 3rd dimension of humanity, the physiological organism, determines the structure of this book.

This book conceives spirituality as a science, a specialization within psychology. This book takes the time to explain its argument and leads the reader step by step to an understanding of the overall theory. This book will be of interest to a growing audience concerned about spirituality-both in academic fields like psychology, sociology, anthropology, and philosophy, as well as religious studies, and in professional fields like nursing, social work, health education, education in general, and of course, psychotherapy and ministry. This book will also be of interest to people in New Age, Eastern, Christian, and other spiritual movements and 12-step programs, concerned about the meaning of life in a multicultural, pluralistic world.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) ""Race, Culture and Counselling"" seeks to explore some of the major dimensions and subtleties underlying the issues of race and culture and how these might impact upon counselling-psychotherapeutic relationships. It contributes to the literature that urges awareness, understanding and acceptance between people of different cultural, racial and linguistic origins. The dimensions of race and culture are extremely complex and have many consequences in therapy. Wherever persons of different races and cultures come together in a counseling relationship, some of their interactions will be an unknown quantity, each may experience discomfort and fear and the results, for both parties, might be negative. [This book] articulates a range of issues that are pertinent to therapists who live and work in a multiracial society and also addresses the challenges posed to trainers, supervisors and researchers of counselling and psychotherapy.

Using South Africa as a case example, the book focuses on the worldwide challenge to the helping professions to contribute toward creating harmony in multiethnic societies. . . . South Africa today, with the drafting of a new constitution that will enfranchise all its citizens, is negotiating and moving toward a greater degree of multiethnic harmony. Nonetheless, because the scars of apartheid will remain for a long time, the present text describes childhood and adolescence in a society that has been severely divided and traumatized by institutionalized racism. This book describes current counseling and educational issues in South Africa and a myriad of disorders that are the effects of structural inequality.

He provides a theoretical and conceptual framework for understanding why teacher cognition as a context specific phenomenon is important, how it is studied, what can be learned, and how these learnings inform the preparation of culturally responsive educators. The contributors look at how teachers think about students of color and/or a multicultural curriculum and explore opportunities for reconstructing teacher knowledge of the cultural context. Rather than focusing on ways in which the students are ""deficient,"" or on the behavioral elements of effective teaching, this book starts with the how and what of teacher thinking as a central element in the teaching-learning relationship. It places the teacher at the center of instructional activity. While teacher thought influences what happens in instructional settings, teacher thought is also influenced by the people and activity critical to those settings.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) The intention of this book is to engage educators in transforming the public school curriculum for a culturally diverse society. This means more than including knowledge about diverse populations. It means reconceptualizing school practices through debate, deliberation, and collaboration involving the diverse voices that comprise the nation. Certain key questions must be addressed in this process: What should be the purpose of schooling in a culturally diverse society? Who should be involved in curriculum planning and what process should be employed? How is the actualized curriculum differentiated? What is the relationship between school practices and the structure of the larger society? How should the curriculum be evaluated? The authors of the essays in this book address critical perspectives from which a framework is constructed for a discourse on planning curriculum for a culturally diverse society.
(from the preface) This book is primarily designed for graduate courses in curriculum development and theory, although it may be used in other courses concerned with cultural diversity.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) The purpose of this book is to provide a graduate-level psychotherapy text that addresses child and adolescent treatment from a multicultural perspective. Three fundamental needs in counselor training are addressed. First, the text elucidates how ethnographic factors (e.g., culture-specific beliefs, values, and behaviors), demographic factors (e.g., gender), affiliation (e.g., religious), and status (e.g., economic) impact child and adolescent treatment. . . . This text . . . addresses multicultural factors as they impact each counseling relationship. . . . [It] illustrates how multicultural factors impact the treatment process when dealing with the most salient clinical disorders and problems that children and adolescents present. 2nd, for novice therapists, working with culturally diverse clients amplifies the complexity and challenge of treating children and adolescents. This text articulates a more practical and integrative relational framework for conceptualizing treatment plans and guiding intervention strategies. The 3rd aim of this text is to address clinical training needs and help trainees work more sensitively and effectively with young clients.

It addressed three research questions: (1) do project teams engage in reflection? (2) how can collective reflection be described in a project team environment? and (3) what conditions are associated with collective reflection? Three project teams with multicultural representation at the International Space University were studied at the mid point of their project life cycle using observation, group and individual interviews and examination of documents as sources of data. Observation was conducted over a number of team meetings: five for team one, six for team two and three for team three. One formal group interview was conducted with each team and was supplemented by informal group interviews. Additionally, follow-on individual interviews were performed with at least two members of each project team. Results indicated that these teams did engage in collective reflection and that types of reflection could be described consistently across teams. Types of reflection focused on the premise of the project itself, the process of the project including project organization, the power of each team, the role of language and culture as well as the appropriateness of the content of the work of each team, given the premise and goals of the project. Results also showed that collective reflection was associated with a consistent set of conditions within each team and across teams. These included active attempts to promote reflection by team members, using visual aids to engage in reflection, linking perspectives with other teams and interpretation of the task as necessitating reflection. The ideal conditions typically associated with dialogue and reflection outlined by current theories in team learning, individual reflection and social change however, were not supported by the results of this study. Results are interpreted using literature in team learning, individual theories of reflection and project team lifecycle dev (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","collective reflection in global project teams, adults","*Collective Behavior

Classrooms in urban, inner city schools have students with many multicultural and linguistic differences who demonstrate a wide range of literacy skill development. This study examined the listening comprehension of eighty fifth graders in three urban classrooms in the San Francisco Bay Area who receive all their instruction in English. The sample included Asian, African American, Filipino, Hispanic, Pacific Islanders, and Caucasian students of low socioeconomic status as measured by percentage of AFDC families. Twenty percent of the sample included bilingual students certified English fluent or Limited English and three special education students. The purpose of this repeated measures experimental study was to examine the effects of two instructional practices, an advance organizer and modeled notetaking, on two aspects of listening comprehension, literal recall and inferencing, using orally delivered, 8-10 minute lecture-type content area instruction delivered under classroom conditions. The study also examined the relationship of working memory as an intervening variable between instructional treatment and listening comprehension by analysis of six subtests of the Cognitive Processing Test developed by H. L. Swanson. The strength of the relationship between students' working memory, reading comprehension and listening comprehension was examined by correlational analysis. Both the advance organizer and the notetaking treatments had strong effects on literal recall but neither had educationally significant effects for inferencing in the full sample. However, both treatments had strong effects on low achievers. There was a 3/4 sigma increase in the use of inferences by the low achievers in the notetaking treatment.

Although many studies on adolescent sexual behavior have addressed racial/ethnic differences, few studies have examined the relation between race/ethnicity while controlling for other sociocultural and psychosocial variables. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between racial/ethnic categories and selected sociocultural and psychosocial variables, with reported adolescent sexual risk-taking and preventive behavior. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information from 3132 students in a Texas school district (Section 3.5.2). The instrument contained approximately 100 questions on demographic characteristics, sexual behavior, and psychosocial determinants of sexual behavior. Based on the findings of this study, the following major conclusions are made: (1) There are differences in reported sexual risk-taking and preventive behavior among Black, Hispanic and White adolescents in this study. The stratified analysis by gender further suggests significant gender differences in reported sexual behavior among the three racial/ethnic groups. (2) Gender, living arrangement, academic grades, and language spoken at home modified the association between reported sexual risk-taking and preventive behavior and race/ethnicity in this study. This suggests that these sociocultural variables should be considered in future research and practice involving multicultural populations. (3) There are differences in selected psychosocial determinants among the three racial/ethnic groups and between males and females. These differences were consistent with the reported sexual risk-taking and preventive behaviors among race/ethnicity and gender for adolescents in this study.

The relationship among social support, self-efficacy, and sense of coherence in an academic context has not been investigated. Although racial differences have been noted, no research has combined these measures to examine academic achievement with a multicultural sample. Methods. Research packets including permission form, demographic sheet, and measures for Perceived Social Support from Friends (PSSFR), Perceived Social Support from Family (PSSFA), Self-Efficacy (SSE), and Sense of Coherence (SOC) were completed by 730 undergraduate and graduate students. The first hypothesis (SOC, SSE, and PSSFR and PSSFA are related) was tested using Pearson product-moment correlations; hypothesis two (SOC, SSE, PSSFR and PSSFA are multiple predictive variables of academic achievement) was tested using multiple regression; hypothesis three (White students, compared to African American and Asian students, will present different profiles on measures of SOC, SSE, PSSFR and PSSFA) was tested using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA); and hypothesis four (strength of measures would vary by ethnicity) was tested using Pearson product-moment correlations. Results. Analyses confirmed a relationship between social support, self-efficacy, and sense of coherence in the moderate to substantial range. Although statistical significance was obtained in multiple regression analyses of Hypothesis 2, results indicated that variance accounted for was minimal. MANOVA indicated a significant interaction of race and measures of PSSFR, PSSFA, SSE, and SOC. Hotelling's t tests showed significant differences between White respondents and African Americans and Asians, who were not significantly different from each other. However, differences accounted for less than 2% of the variance, suggesting that the results had negligible practical importance. Strength of relationship varied by ethnicity. This research therefore confirmed the hypothesized significant relationships a (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","social support & self-efficacy & sense of coherence & academic achievement, African-American vs Asian vs White college & graduate students","*College Academic Achievement

The response groups were seven high school junior or senior Latinas enrolled in the Magnet Gifted High School during the 1994-95 school year and seven young women who graduated from the same program during the years 1985 through 1993. The GL's were interviewed extensively, using the key informant process of the ethnographic interview. The interviews were transcribed and categorized and analyzed by domain and taxonomy. This study examined affective dissonance of those GL's who were graduates of the magnet school gifted program and how the socialization in gifted education affected them. The causes for the dissonance revealed in the alumni GL's ""lifestories"" resulted from their culturally-assigned gender roles, their families' strict controls over their social lives, and the persecution they suffered from their non-achieving peers and relatives. The GL's identified factors of affective dissonance that made them unhappy, and they told how they developed coping strategies to overcome those barriers and realize their aspirations. The findings substantiate previous studies that show high-achieving Latinas need to be separated from their low-achieving peers in order to sustain achievement levels, at least by middle school. The ethnographic interviews and analyses revealed the ""lifeworlds"" of the GL's, showing that they usually acquire a strong sense of self-identity by 5th grade, through accommodation and/or resistance to the conflicting messages they encounter. This sustains them in both their academic struggles and in the affective dissonance they experience when the cultures of home and the mainstream values system clash in middle school and beyond. The current students told a different story in some way (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","affective dissonance & magnet school socialization, gifted Latina high school students","*Emotional Responses

Through a longitudinal research design incorporating survey and interview data, this study examined predictors of student attitudes toward sexual diversity in a cohort of 1,041 students attending the University of Michigan from 1990 to 1994. This single-institution study suggests five major conclusions about the impact of college on these attitudes. First, college provides new opportunities for students to understand and appreciate sexual diversity. Through these opportunities, the majority of students become significantly more accepting of sexual diversity by their fourth year of college. On average, women enter college with a higher degree of acceptance than men and increase their acceptance while at college to a greater extent than men. Second, contact with lesbian, gay, and bisexual people is a primary mechanism through which students' attitudes change. For students who enter college with negative attitudes toward sexual diversity, contact through casual acquaintances and classmates helps students reexamine prior stereotypes and assumptions. For students who enter college with ambivalent or positive attitudes toward sexual diversity, contact through close friendships helps bring meaning and conviction to students' acceptance of sexual diversity. Third, cognitive, moral, and social identity development indicators are associated with students' capacity for tolerance and openness to difference. Gender differences in these indicators explain higher levels of acceptance regarding sexual diversity among women.

Using quantitative and qualitative data, the investigator examined the efficacy of Pedersen's Triad Model as a training intervention to help counselors from the dominant culture improve service delivery to African American clients. There were two hypotheses and two qualitative suppositions in the study. The first hypothesis predicted that African American clients in Grades 8 through 12 would rate counselors trained in the Triad Model higher in attractiveness, trustworthiness, expertness, and empathy than counselors trained in a contrasting method or who received no training. The second hypothesis predicted that clients would indicate greater satisfaction with school counseling when their counselors received Triad training. The qualitative suppositions suggested that Triad-trained counselors would demonstrate more client and family outreach than contrast method or non-trained counselors. Nine White middle and high school counselors were assigned to -three training groups: Triad, contrast, and control. A randomly selected sample of 60 African American clients rated their counselors in the areas of attractiveness, expertness, trustworthiness, empathy, and satisfaction with school counseling on three different occasions. To generate qualitative data, an African American counselor conducted structured interviews with 22 of the 60 clients. The investigator analyzed the quantitative data by using a doubly repeated multivariate analysis of variance. She studied the qualitative data by looking at frequencies and percentages of answers as well as the subjective comments of the interviewed clients. Triad counselors received higher ratings than contrast counselors but did not receive higher ratings than control counselors. The qualitative information, however, suggested that interventions used by Triad counselors (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","multicultural triad training, perception of attractiveness & expertise & trustworthiness & empathy of White school counselors & satisfaction with school counseling, 8-12 yr old Afro-Americans","*Counselor Characteristics

Subjects were asked to respond to a self-report questionnaire packet including measures of perceived stressfulness of life events (nonethnic-related stressor) and minority student stresses (ethnic-related stresses), coping strategies (problem solving, social support, and avoidance), and adaptive outcomes (psychological distress, behavior problems, and academic performance). The results confirmed that minority student stress was associated with an increased risk for psychological distress and behavior problems in the Chinese sample, and perceived negative life events were positively associated with academic performance in the Vietnamese sample. These associations were evident even after controlling for the effects of gender, length of U.S. residence, and family SES. The hypotheses regarding the mediating effects of coping strategies for the stress outcome relationships were not confirmed by the data in this study. Only the avoidance coping strategy appears to be a positive correlate of psychological distress and behavior problems in the Chinese adolescent sample. A multicultural perspective on stress was supported in this study, which underscores the roles of culture on stress and coping processes. There are several limitations of the study so that caution must be exercised in interpreting the findings. Despite these limitations, this study does make important research contributions, theoretical contributions, and clinical implications to the growing body of literature on minority adolescent stress.

Several conceptualizations of ethnic diversity have influenced schools, including assimilation defined as Anglo-conformity, assimilation defined as ""melting pot,"" and cultural pluralism. Since the 1960s, multicultural education has become an umbrella term for a variety of approaches to ethnic and cultural pluralism. James A. Banks of the University of Washington, Carl A. Grant of the University of Wisconsin, and Asa G. Hilliard III of Georgia State University are three contemporary African American theorists who have been writing about multicultural education since the 1960s. Six questions are posed of their published work: (1) How is multicultural education for schools defined? (2) What are the implications of multicultural education for curriculum and instruction? (3) How are individual and group rights and responsibilities defined and related to each other? (4) What are the implications of multicultural education for human relations within schools? (5) What are the implications of multicultural education for the structural organization of schools? (6) What justification for multicultural education is offered through empirical, historical, and philosophical analysis? In the final chapter, a critical analysis of the work of James Banks, Carl Grant, and Asa Hilliard locates them within the broader context of multicultural education research in the United States. Banks' typologies of Ethnic Revitalization Movements and Stages of Ethnic and Cultural Development, and his identification of five dimensions of multicultural education are important theoretical contributions to multicultural education research. Although he is as critical of educational inequity as are Grant and Hilliard, Banks views multicultural education as consistent with the American democratic tradition and argues that a core of common values derived (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","views on multicultural education & its implications for curriculum & instruction & human relations & school's structural organizations, contemporary African American theorists","*Curriculum Development

In order to accomplish this effectively, more understanding of the process of becoming a multicultural advocate is needed. The purpose of this study was to explore, through the perceptions of teachers and administrators in a Midwestern public school district, the process of becoming a multicultural advocate. A grounded theory methodology was used in order to establish a theory of becoming a multicultural advocate. The theory states that the context of environment encapsulates all of the causal conditions (personality, family, relationships, life experience, knowledge, beliefs, personality), intervening conditions (barriers), action/interaction strategies (interventions, assimilation), and consequences (behavior) of the phenomenon of multicultural advocacy. Therefore, before multicultural advocacy can take place, the environment must be made conducive to multicultural advocacy. Specific actions and strategies were suggested by the informants and an intervention process was proposed. The process highlights the continued participation of the informants in the persistence of identifying key environmental concepts that need to be transformed and in utilizing the informants' leadership to motivate others to move toward becoming multicultural advocates.

As social interactions among members of various ethnic groups have increased, so too have the number of mixed-heritage couples. Consequently, there are now many more children of mixed heritage in our country than ever before, and their number is likely to increase. These children have traditionally been viewed by the larger society, and presented in the social science literature, as disturbed, maladjusted or inherently pathological. The purpose of this study was to explore from a phenomenological perspective mixed-heritage children's perceptions about themselves and their heritage. This study attempted to provide a better understanding of mixed-heritage children, by asking them directly about their perceptions and experiences. Using a case study qualitative method, data was gathered through in-depth interviews with twelve children of mixed heritage. A triangulation strategy was used for the data analysis in the search for patterns, categories and themes among participants' responses. There were three major findings of this study. It was found that participants have positive perceptions of themselves and their mixed-heritage. It was found that participants feel that they are sometimes perceived by others in negative and stereotypical ways. It was also found that participants value the role of their family in coping with the larger society. In addition, it was found that participants have experienced racism to different degrees and that some of them have experienced extended family tension because of their parents' mixed-heritage marriage. Participants attributed several advantages to their mixed heritage, including: (1) an ability to see things from different perspectives, (2) being open-minded to different people and situations, and (3) being able to bridge cultures. Some of the participants identified religion and language as key values of their families.

As this trend continues into the next century, the examination of career development from a multicultural perspective will undoubtedly become a necessary line of inquiry. While efforts to understand the career behavior of minorities is important in any context, the rate of growth among Hispanics and their increasing role in the labor force emphasize the urgency of relevant research to guide both theory and practice in career psychology. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of a select set of career variables (career decision status, career salience, vocational identity, and beliefs regarding the development and implementation of career goals), family cohesion, and key demographic variables (age, gender, and socioeconomic status) to the acculturation level of a sample of 176 Mexican American community college students. Results of a series of multiple regression analyses using a blocked entry method indicated that the career variables failed to account for a significant portion of the variance in acculturation. The family cohesion variable was also found to be unrelated to acculturation level. The demographic variables, however, were found to be significantly related to acculturation. Most importantly, the patterns of relationships among the career variables for the participants in this study were found to be similar to those reported in previous studies with Whites. Based on these findings, it appears that existing career theories and interventions, established almost exclusively with Whites, may also be applicable for use with Mexican Americans who have acculturation levels similar to the participants in this study. Limitations of this study include the use of a very acculturated sample which makes comparisons with less acculturated populations inappropriate. Recommendations for future research include greater variability in the acculturation leve (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","career decision status & career salience & vocational identity & family cohesion & age & gender & socioeconomic status, level of acculturation, Mexican-American college students","*Acculturation

That new layer is culture. One aspect of the cultural challenge facing organizations is that employees of diverse nationalities must bridge their cultural distance to collaborate successfully in their work. In culturally differentiated organizations, therefore, employees must contend with cultural barriers in order to communicate effectively, motivate effectively, and administrate effectively. They must do so on task-oriented projects and in interpersonal relationships. The objective of this dissertation is to generate a theoretical understanding of the role played by cultural differences in attaining integration in multicultural organizations. Toward this end, interviews and surveys of 43 managers in 3 multinational organizations were conducted and produced qualitative and quantitative data regarding 77 specific intercultural work experiences. Cultural distance was operationalized using difference scores on Hofstede's (1980a, 1991) five dimensions of national culture: power distance, individualism-collectivism, masculinity-femininity, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term versus short-term orientation. Hierarchical regression analyses of both survey data and content-coded interview data confirmed a multivariate model in which cultural distance across all the dimensions predicts cultural familiarity, which predicts process effectiveness, which in turn predicts business outcome favorability, with international experience moderating the effects of cultural distance on cultural familiarity. Exploration of the impact of specific cultural dimensions found that cultural distance between interacting colleagues in terms of power distance and individualism-collectivism had the greatest influence on the interaction process. Finally, thematic analyses resulted in descriptive information about the business issues and outcomes of the reported episodes, the types of problems that occurred, the (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","cultural differences & attainment of integration, managers in multicultural organizations","*Cross Cultural Differences

Classical and contemporary theoretical perspectives on self, culture, and social cognition provided the conceptual frame. It was proposed that individuals' comparison of self with the nation group is systematically related to their ethno-cultural self-definitions and their race. The research evolved through a series of preliminary explorations in which a total of 964 undergraduate students participated at various stages. The main study was designed with three levels of Self-definitions: ""Canadian"", ""Ethnic-Canadian"" and ""Ethnic""; and two levels of race: ""Caucasian"" and ""Visible"", resulting in a 3 X 2 format. The self-nation group comparisons were assessed by the measures of Perceived Agreement (PA) and Perceived Uniqueness (PU). In addition, the subjective image of Canadian was also explored. Two hundred and fifty-six undergraduate students participated in the main study by completing a self-explanatory questionnaire. It was predicted that there would be a main effect of Self-definitions on PA and PU, and there would be an interaction effect of Self-definition and Race on PA and PU. The results indicated that there was no main effect of Self-definition on PA or on PU. Instead, there was a main effect of Race on PA and a main effect of Gender on PU. Visibles, compared to Caucasians, perceived a higher opinion similarity with the nation group. Women perceived lower uniqueness of their abilities than men. The predicted interaction of Race and Self-definition was only marginally supported. The subjective image of Canadian was generally positive, particularly for the Visible women and Visible Ethnics. The implications of the findings for Canadian multiculturalism are discussed within the broad frame of theoretical perspectives.

In Part 1, the voices of five young people from Cambodia, Guatemala, South Africa, and the United States reveal the uniqueness of each individual and the particularity of each culture as well as the commonalities of violence and of suffering. In Part 2, analysis of the self-reported experiences of nine ""core-research"" and twenty ""background-research"" young people shows the importance of the inspiration, love, and recognition they received from early relationships with family or other adults, of their engagement in youth and political movements, of their sense of connection with religious perspectives as well as with the creative arts, and the significance of their participation in the Children of War program. A description is provided, in the teenagers' own words, of how elements of this youth leadership and empowerment program--including lifestorytelling, emotional release, peer support groups, and activities grounded in concepts of appropriate ways to deal with oppression, power, and adult-youth relationships--contributed to profound moments of insight and transformation. Part 3 reviews current academic conceptualizations of leadership (Burns) as well as describing in detail five young people's views of leadership. The summary of findings, along with the extensive recommendations for both practitioners and researchers contained in Part 4, suggest that more theoretical, empirical and applied work is needed to deepen present understandings of how to obtain peace by peaceful means--the goal of peace research as proposed by Johan Galtung.

The preliminary aims of this study were to describe the Hispanic healing practice known as curanderismo in terms of its function as a mental health resource for Hispanics residing in a semirural city in California's Central Valley. The study's primary focus was on providing a clinically relevant descriptive and interpretive analysis of curanderismo within the context of ethnic-minority psychotherapy research. The study employed the fourfold model developed by Luis A. Vargas and Joan D. Koss-Chioino (1992), referred to as the multidimensional model for understanding culturally responsive psychotherapies. This model provides an organizational matrix for the analysis of the structural and cultural components of culturally responsive psychotherapies. Four descriptive and speculative research question areas were generated from the model's four descriptive categories: cultural content and context and form and process. The study employed qualitative research strategies and was based upon a human sciences orientation to psychological research. During a 2-year period, data were gathered from the healing practice of a spiritualistic curandera (female Hispanic folk healer), who served as the study's chief informant. Data analysis involved primarily the application of qualitative typological analysis and, to a limited extent, quantitative enumerative analysis. The study found that, in this instance, curanderismo served the mental health needs of primarily low-income, monolingual, Spanish-speaking, Mexican Americans.

The final sample for this study consisted of 120 (56 African-American, 12 Asian-American, 33 Latin-American and 19 white) volunteers (out of a population of 258) who received the EOF grant in the 1992-1393 academic year, and completed the measures of this study. Global self-concept was evaluated by the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale and academic self-concept was evaluated by the Academic Self-Concept Scale and the Non-Cognitive Questionnaire-Revised. Cumulative grade point average was used to measure college academic achievement. The results of this study are that when racial and ethnic groups are evaluated within the context of a successful EOF program for college women, there are no significant differences in self-concept, for both global and academic self-concept. The results of this study also are that when non-traditional college women receive comparable support for personal and academic success, significant differences in GPA between and among specific ethnic and racial subgroups may be minimized. Finally, the relationship between self-concept and GPA was similar for all racial and ethnic groups in this study: global self-concept was positively, but not significantly, correlated with GPA, and academic self-concept had a significant, positive relationship with GPA.

This study was conducted to determine (1) whether student evaluations of teachers and ratings of teacher behaviors are related to the ethnicity of the students, (2) the relationship between overall student evaluations of teachers, classes, and ratings of teacher behaviors, and (3) the relationship between student evaluations of teachers, ratings of teacher behaviors, and student achievement. Method. Two teacher evaluation instruments were administered to students in undergraduate classes at a Christian college and a Christian university. The Student Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) was used as a high-inference evaluation form and the Teacher Behavior Inventory (TBT) was used as a low-inference rating form. The sample included 414 students from one college with a multicultural population and 67 students from one college with a homogeneous ethnic population. Results. In both the college and the university, no relationship was found between ethnicity and student evaluations of teachers. In the multiethnic setting, differences were found between the ratings of teacher behaviors by Caucasian students and the students from the remaining ethnic groups (p <). The Caucasian students tended to rate teachers lower in the areas of structuring and interaction, and higher in the areas of interest and pacing than the students from the other ethnic groups represented. Student ratings of teacher behaviors were significantly related to students' overall evaluation of teachers and classes. The behaviors that were significantly related to the evaluations differed for each ethnic group. Student evaluations of teachers and ratings of teacher behaviors were significantly, though weakly, related to achievement. The areas of evaluations and ratings that were related to achievement were different for each ethnic group. Conclusions. Students in general tend to give teachers positive evaluations and there were no significant differences among evaluations of teachers done (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","ethnicity & student achievement, student evaluations of teachers & student ratings of teacher behavior, undergraduates in colleges with multicultural population vs homogenous population","*Academic Achievement

Given that therapists are a part of the cultural and social milieu and that the psychotherapeutic process is presumed to parallel the dynamics of that same environment, it is not surprising that gays and lesbians encounter obstacles in therapy that are similar to those they encounter in society in general. What is surprising is that these obstacles continue to exist more than 20 years after the depathologizing of homosexuality by the American Psychiatric Association, and that therapist training programs, for the most part, have not included gays and lesbians in multicultural counseling courses and have not educated students regarding gay/lesbian development and lifestyles. This study summarizes obstacles commonly encountered by gays and lesbians in their therapy attempts as identified by counselors in the professional literature. A major objective of the study is to humanize the statistics related to this problem through a qualitative exploration of these obstacles to counseling as experienced by 6 gay and lesbian individuals who volunteered to be subjects in the study. Although the limitations of the study in terms of its phenomenological nature and the purposeful, intensity sampling strategies used are acknowledged, findings are discussed and some recommendations for further research and change are made. Further qualitative studies in both individual and group sessions with gay and lesbian persons who have resolved existential crises might contribute to a better understanding of the process by which such individuals reconcile their conflicts with socially approved and accepted identity norms, and may be generalizable to other individuals who struggle with victimization, bias, and oppression related to social attitudes.

A related problem has been the underutilization of family therapy among multicultural families. There are four aspects to the present study: (1) to determine if the factor structure of the Family Functioning Scale (FFS) obtained in previous studies using non-minority families is replicated on a multicultural sample; (2) to determine if there are any differences on the FFS subscales between a multicultural and non-multicultural sample; (3) to determine if within-family agreement on the FFS can be replicated on a multicultural sample; and (4) to examine attitudes toward family counseling/therapy among multicultural families. Results indicated that construct validity of the FFS was demonstrated insofar as the general component structure of the FFS was replicated using a multicultural sample. When compared to a previous sample of non-minority subjects, the present sample differed on the FFS in a number of understandable ways. The sample of non-minority triads scored higher on the following scales: Family Rituals, Communication, and Positive Family Affect. The multicultural sample scored higher on the Worries subscale. The two samples did not differ on the Conflict subscale. A replication of a previous study (Lubiner, 1989) which found high within-family agreement on the FFS using a non-minority sample yielded similar results for the present sample. Although multivariate analyses showed significant differences on family members' scores due to gender and generation, there were high levels of within family agreement for multicultural populations. Thus, one family member can adequately represent family consensus on the FFS. The ""Attitudes Toward Family Counseling Questionnaire"" qualitatively explored possible obstacles to seeking treatment.

Research suggests that counselor benefits derived from counseling practica can be decreased due to the anxiety associated with clinical supervision. This study examined the effect of pre-supervision preparation on masters level counselors-in-training (CITs). The subjects were masters level students enrolled in counseling practica at the University of Northern Colorado. An experimental design was used in which the experimental group observed a preparation videotape about supervision. The control group observed a videotape about multicultural counseling which served as a benign condition to control for placebo effects. All CITs were assessed by self-ratings using the Counselor Evaluation Rating Scale (CERS) and Role Conflict Role Ambiguity Inventory (RCRAI) and by supervisor ratings of the CITs using the CERS. The CERS provided measures of counseling, supervision, and overall performance. The RCRAI provided measures of role conflict and role ambiguity. Results of analyses of variance (ANOVA) to test the effect of the experimental condition on CIT outcome measures revealed that the pre-supervision method did not result in significantly different scores on the CERS and RCRAI compared to the control group condition, therefore, the research hypotheses were not supported. In summary, the findings suggested that pre-supervision preparation did not result in significant differences in CITs' performance. Supplemental analyses did indicate differences between the groups. The experimental condition had significant negative correlations (p <) between ratings of role ambiguity or role conflict and ratings of overall performance. Correlations derived from the analyses of the same variables from the control group were not significant. Significant positive correlations (p <) were indicated for supervisor ratings and experimental subjects' self-estimates of overall performance.

Kids' College was developed to teach children about different cultures in a way that would impact their attitudes and behaviors toward different groups of people. This program was based on two psychological theories of attitude change, contact theory and cooperative learning. Sixty African-American and European-American children between the ages of eight and eleven years of age participated in one of two sessions of Kids' College. Parent and child evaluations of the program were quite positive and while participating in the program, children increased their knowledge about other cultures and decreased their stereotypical racial and cultural attitudes. Although there were significant attitude changes during the program, these changes were short-lived. Consequently, in order for a program like Kids' College to be most effective in effecting long-lasting attitude change, it needs to be longer in duration, or integrated into multiple settings in the child's life.

This research attempted to determine the existence of an interaction between learner group and receipt of treatment/placebo, and to determine how this link influenced learner performance on a criterion referenced posttest. Three hypotheses subsumed within two research questions were examined. A factorial research design was implemented. The two groups considered by this research were mothers of five to nine year old ""language delayed"" children and mothers of same age ""non-language delayed"" children. Criteria for inclusion into the ""language delay"" group was the set of criterion utilized by the State of California. Sample size of the study was 56 voluntary participants. There were 28 mothers in the non-language delayed group, and 28 in the language delayed group. Twenty eight mothers received the treatment, and an equal number received the placebo. Each participating mother had at least one child (aged five to nine) attending a California school during the 1993-1994 school year. Other than child-based differences, the groups possessed similar characteristics. Ethnic backgrounds paralleled the school district's multicultural parental ethnicity. The treatment, created expressly for this study, was a paper-based, instructionally designed intervention concerned with the dimensionality of mother-child interactions. Specifically, it instructed the mothers in the skill: ""Generate the transformation from unidimensional to multidimensional interactions using the techniques of maternal adjustment of behavior and bridging settings."" Several practical findings resulted. As related to the three hypotheses, there were the following findings. First, study results found the treatment instruction provided appropriate learning outcomes (Gagne, Briggs, & Wager, 1992) to learners randomly s (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","generalizability of instructionally designed intervention concerned with dimensionality of mother-child interactions, mothers of language-delayed vs non-language delayed 5-9 yr olds","*Learning

It argues that a more reflexive multicultural discourse is needed, both to advance research on the implementation of multicultural education, as well as to promote more genuine forms of multicultural teaching and learning. Furthermore, a reflexive or self-aware multiculturalism would allow us to focus on developing models for learning culture that can promote real transformation in the way we conceptualize and practice education in plural societies.

Krippendorff's (1980) content analysis procedures, a total of 260 college courses and professional training programs in intercultural communication from 9 cross-cultural education and training categories (intercultural communication, language and culture, international/global communication, human relations, interethnic/interracial, cultural diversity, multicultural education, cross-cultural psychology, and cross-cultural research) were analyzed on the basis of goals, content, and methods. A majority (88%) of both types of programs were judged as integrating multidimensional goals (cognitive, affective, and behavioral), content (culture general and culture specific) and process (intellectual and experiential). The results of the analysis suggest that while some practitioners still maintain a unidimensional focus in their cross-cultural training and education activities, the majority of them prefer teaching and learning strategies that are multidimensional.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"When one understands psychological science to be a by-product of the Western tradition, fashioned by particular cultural and historical conditions, the door is opened to a fresh consideration of the practice of psychology in the global context. By using examples from experiences in Turkey, New Zealand, and India, the reader is sensitized first to the problems inherent in the unreflective exportation of Western psychology. To presume Western concepts of the mind, along with its methods of study, not only lends itself to research of little relevance to other cultures, but disregards and undermines alternate cultural traditions. Against these tendencies toward a univocal science, the authors argue for a multicultural psychology-one that celebrates the rich multiplicity of indigenous conceptualizations of the person along with varying means of acquiring knowledge. To realize such a psychology, new forms of dialogue must be sought and the sharing made relevant to ongoing challenges of practical cultural signiflcance.

It was reasoned that such a relationship, depending on the TLs of the faculty and administrators, could influence any plan to change and improve the multiethnic climate in schools. Ss were given a modified Belief Systems Test and Multiethnic Climate Inventory (MCI). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and univariate analysis showed significant differences in MCI scores for abstract, middle level, and concrete thinkers, revealing that concrete thinkers tend to resist changes that clash with their beliefs against multiethnic interaction, and that abstract thinkers were more likely to consider and adopt change. These imply that teachers' TLs must be considered when designing multiethnic training programs and that diverse experiences be provided to move all teachers toward abstract TLs.

Results show that LAQ was a reliable and valid instrument which comprehensively assessed lifestyle and stress; both groups provided adult norms. Support for its validity was shown by the low lack of association with demographic factors and social desirability. LAQ also proved to be a sensitive measure of change, with the treatment group reporting a reduction in their cognitive appraisal of life stress.

The author presents the cases of 3 HIV-positive women: a 35-yr-old African American; a 34-yr-old Black Dominican; and a 30-yr-old Nigerian, referred for psychotherapy due to noncompliance with medical treatment.

The organization, journals, and funding of the scientific discipline are described. The importance of D. O. Hebb's research as the stimulus and foundation for discipline growth and significant research contributions to basic processes is identified. The multicultural mosaic of Canadian society and early research on 2nd-language learning are shown to have influenced cross-cultural and social research. Canadian research contributions to basic processes and to the social and health sciences are reviewed. Although late to begin in Canada, clinical research and the profession of psychology are shown to have substantially developed over the past 2 decades. With large numbers of quality researchers and practitioners, psychology has a bright future in Canada.

Culturally competent assessment includes culture-specific styles of service delivery, use of the client's 1st language, and an evaluation of the client as a cultural being prior to test administration using cultural orientation categories. This information is essential for understanding health/illness beliefs, to indicate the possible presence of culture-specific symptoms, and to select standard or culture-specific tests. Assessment ethics recognize the desirability of alteration/modification of standard tests by translation and development of new norms. Cross-cultural construct validity, response sets, and cultural variables are also research priorities. Cultural orientation is very important in the construction of culture-specific tests, as well as in the delivery of test findings.

Contemporary media and new technologies are highlighted both as sources of disparities and as bridges between the generations-how they ""watch politics,"" how they prefer to solve social problems, and how intergenerational understanding could be improved through communication and education. Throughout the book, Florida is viewed as a microcosm of America's future-there the ratio between young and old already resembles the probable makeup of the nation if current age trends continue through the year 2000.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) ""Understanding Older Chicanas"" examines older Chicanas' lives, status, and public policy needs. Chicana elderly tend to be poor, reflecting the economic position of Chicanos in American society; they also tend to be stereotyped as widows and grandmothers, reflecting the cultural values of Mexican American society. This work shows how Chicana elderly cope with this economic and cultural marginality and how they gain the personal and financial resources they require. Elisa Facio also relates how scholars and public policymakers have previously understood Chicana elderly, provides new data on the social meaning of Chicana old age, and points out the implications of that meaning for future policymakers. [This book is for] those in academic and policy settings who are interested in issues regarding multicultural aging experiences, diversification, life-cycle phases, socialization, and women.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) [This] is a book about adult development. It is not just a catalogue of facts about adults, or a text about the characteristics of adults compared to children, or a discussion of old age. Instead, this book is about adults over the full range of adult years, from 18 to 100; or more. It is about the ways in which adults change or develop in both shared and individual ways over those years. Divided into 3 main sections, the 1st 3 chapters lay the groundwork, describing some of the key dimensions on which adults differ at the start of their journey through adulthood, and introducing some major concepts and theories of adult development. Chapters 4 through 11 then describe the major empirical information we have about changes and continuities in functioning over the years of adulthood. The final group of chapters explores the stresses of adult life, death and dying, and offers a theoretical synthesis. Revised and updated, the Third Edition features a greater multicultural emphasis and expanded coverage of topics such as health changes and social roles. In addition, each chapter now includes a set of critical thinking questions that ask readers to apply the material to personal life experiences, consider a theoretical question, or attempt to design research that would answer some specific question.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Presents preliminary overviews from anthropology for developing adolescent health care in post-modern multicultural situations, linking the adolescent's life with the interests of practitioners, researchers and policymakers. The author contends that mental instabilities are inherent to adolescence, especially in the need to be different, ""to differentiate from each other."" Diffusion has accelerated so much this century that ""changing times"" should be the main target in adolescent health care issues. Six statements are formulated from clinical experience and from literature to serve as basic components for discussions. The author asserts that parents, teachers, tutors, mentors and medical/mental practitioners have to learn, more than before, from adolescents to develop their caring, curing and health education and help them become initiated into adulthood. This effort towards a more integrative perspective upon mental health is based upon 7 yrs of clinical research among psychiatrically hospitalized drafted soldiers in the Netherlands.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Administering psychological tests developed for middle-class, English-speaking populations to examinees who are linguistically, culturally, and demographically different has been a controversial topic for over five decades (Dana, 1993; Padilla, 1979; Padilla & Ruiz, 1975; Olmedo, 1981). Originally the controversy surrounded intelligence testing of Blacks; however, similar allegations of bias toward Hispanics have also been raised in the context of personality testing and diagnostic evaluation. The prevailing argument emphasizes that in the absence of empirical evidence to the contrary, standard mental health evaluation procedures are considered unbiased (e.g., Lopez, 1988). The other side of the polemic argues that clients' variations in English language proficiency, cultural background, or demographic profile pose potential sources of bias for standard assessment and diagnostic practices (e.g., Dana, 1993; Malgady, Rogler & Costantino, 1987; Malgady, Rogler & Costantino, 1988; Sue, 1988). We have argued that, even in the absence of compelling empirical evidence, assessment procedures ought not be routinely generalized to different cultural groups, and multicultural tests and assessments should be increasingly used (Costantino, 1992; Malgady, 1990). This chapter first presents a review of selected literature on the topic of multicultural assessment. This literature is organized according to five definitions of test bias in accordance to psychometric tradition. We then turn to a specific effort of the development of the Rorschach's Comprehensive System (Exner, 1993).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Assessing and treating culturally diverse clients: A practical guide by Freddy A. Panaigua (see record 1996-97152-000). This book is a timely and provocative delineation of highly relevant considerations to be made by counselors, psychotherapists, and other mental health professionals in the delivery of services to multicultural groups. The book deals with four ethnic populations in the United States-African American, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian. Panaigua's contribution is part of a series on Multicultural Aspects of Counseling by Sage Publications. The purpose of the series is to increase the mental health practitioner's knowledge and sensitivity to cultural differences and to assist in alleviating bias in the therapeutic process. This purpose is accomplished with precision and insight by Panaigua. Unlike some other books dealing with cultural diversity, Panaigua's work offers specific treatment methods which have been demonstrated to be successful in treating members of the targeted groups. Problem solving and social skills training are recommended in some cases. In other instances, assertiveness training, music therapy, or direct advice are the modalities of choice. In other cases, education, medication, or behavioral approaches are preferred. Assessing and Treating Culturally Diverse Clients can serve the educational needs of graduate students in the fields of psychology, counseling, family therapy, and social work. It is an excellent guide for use in either the training or practice of these helping professions.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Cross-Cultural Roots of Minority Child Development by Patricia M. Greenfield and Rodney R. Cocking (Eds.) (see record 1994-98022-000). With this book, the goal of the editors and their sponsoring agencies (the American Psychological Association and the International Society for the Study of Behavioral Development) is to ""internationalize the field of developmental psychology"" by seeking to understand the nature of behavior as well as the attitudes, customs, values, and cultural experiences that shape behavior within minority groups. The volume is divided into three sections, ""American Roots,"" ""African Roots,"" and ""Asian Roots,"" and attempts in each chapter to investigate how ethnic cultures either adapt or deviate from U.S. culture, and to evaluate the impact of these adaptations on behaviors and experiences. The general theme is that the Euro-American pattern of socialization is but one conceptual system of developmental alternatives, and researchers need to collaborate to develop other viable alternatives. This book is an excellent source for gaining information regarding the socialization and development of the minority groups. It is also a more current attempt to develop guidelines for building models of development that are multicultural in perspective. It begins to look at the impact of culture on psychological processes. The book does not accomplish all the hefty goals put forth, but it does present useful information which can help graduate students in the social sciences, developmental, educational, clinical, and school psychologists, and researchers to give more credence to the impact of culture on development and socialization in their respective fields of work. This book would be appropriate for courses that have a focus on multicultural aspects, such as race and ethnicity, educational aspects of minority groups, and mental health courses addressing appropriate interventions.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Editorial,"While continuing to acknowledge the primacy of individual differences, the mental health field has begun to recognize systematically culture as a pivotal factor in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The American Psychological Association has developed guidelines for providers of psychological services to ethnic, linguistic, and culturally diverse populations. Similarly, the American Psychiatric Association has officially acknowledged the significance of cultural issues in the fourth edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Despite the heightened awareness of the importance of cultural variables in psychopathology and treatment, until now, articles on cultural topics have been scattered throughout the literature, often appearing in publications focusing only on one particular cultural group. With the birth of Cultural Diversity and Mental Health we are pleased to be able to offer a multidisciplinary forum for a wide array of theoretical, clinical, and research articles on ethnosociocultural factors and mental health. The journal seeks to promote heightened ""multicultural literacy"" by providing psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists, counselors, psychopharmacologists, and other mental health professionals with the knowledge base and therapeutic tools to assess and treat clients effectively from diverse backgrounds.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Childcare issues lie at the critical nexus where questions relating to the economy, state ideology, culture, and women's roles come together. We explore the childcare strategies of Singapore women in the context of a society which is distinctively ""multiracial"" with deep cultural tap roots and which is at the same time experiencing rapid economic development. Drawing on recent conceptualisations in the work of feminist geographers and field data, we outline a framework of different modes of childcare provision available in Singapore before using this to inform the discussion on ethnic variations in women's choice of childcare strategies. In particular, we focus on the cultural concerns of women of different ethnicities, and the constraints they face. Through a series of case studies, we examine how women in a variety of ways reconcile cultural parameters with practical conditions in an attempt to come to terms with their choice of childcare strategies. More specifically, we argue that there is slippage between the state's multiracial ideology and minority women's access and experience of childcare services.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article reports on a two-part study of African American children's uses of various forms of the /-s/ suffix. Part 1 of the research consists of a careful replication of Torrey's (1972) experimental study to investigate the correlation between language and educational achievement. This replication study involved the administration of a series of pre- and posttest measures to determine surface-level uses of four /-s/ morphemes among 17 second-grade students. In addition to these assessment measures, a worksheet-based, explicit instructional program took place between the preand posttests in order to establish whether training could have the effect of bringing to a surface level the sibilant morphemes that might otherwise be hidden in the students' underlying grammar. Part 2 consisted of a replication of Torrey's study with a slight variation to her instructional component. This part of the study administered Torrey's pre- and posttest measures to a different group of 14 second-grade students, but provided a literature-based instructional program in which the students were taught the various /-s/ morphemes using multicultural and African American literature. Findings revealed that the explicit instructional approach was most useful when teaching some morphological concepts but a literature-based instructional approach was most useful when teaching others. These findings suggest the need to reflect diversity and flexibility in the design and implementation of assessment and instructional materials. The findings also suggest that decisions about teaching Mainstream American Academic English (MAAE) to speakers from diverse linguistic backgrounds should be based on students' overall patterns of linguistic competence rather than on observations of their language use in limited contexts. A number of implications for classroom practice are considered, including the need to develop links between studies in language and linguistic competence and the planning and implementation of learning programs.

This is a review of the book, ""Psychology: Themes and Variations (3rd ed.)"" (see record 1994-98920-000). Weiten's ""Psychology: Themes and Variations (3rd ed.)"" is an excellent text for introducing students to the field of psychology. The best quality of this textbook is Weiten's writing style. Each chapter includes several components designed to help the student better understand the material. First, there are Concept Checks, which are mini-quizzes midway through the chapters. Second, the Featured Studies in each chapter expose the student to a detailed account of relevant research. Third, each chapter ends with an Application. The Applications allow the student to see how the information for each chapter is put to use in the real world. One key difference between this third edition and the previous ones is the addition of a new theme. In this edition, he adds a new theme: Our behavior is shaped by our cultural heritage. Weiten included this new theme in the hope of better representing America's multicultural makeup. This book is highly recommended to instructors of introductory psychology courses.

The focus is on assessing children's intelligence using standardized approaches. Major intelligence tests are described in detail, including theoretical framework, standardization, subtest content and structure, psychometric properties, administration and scoring, interpretation, and strengths and weaknesses, followed by a case study or a sample case. Less attention is devoted to alternative tests of intelligence or to the assessment of infants, preschoolers, and exceptional children. References to relevant sources of information would have been helpful. The chapter on multicultural assessment and bias provides limited direction about how to approach the problems in testing children from different ethnic and language backgrounds. The beginning student will come away with a good understanding of the major psychometric tests and how to administer and interpret them, but with less understanding of the complexities and limitations, even controversies, in assessing intelligence.

Matsumoto challenges information in traditional psychology textbooks by presenting some of the same material with a multicultural focus. As such, this book (see record 1994-97031-000) acts a strong supplement to introductory materials, allowing instructors and students to compare information from different perspectives and revise assumptions to incorporate diversity. In the first two chapters of the book, Matsumoto lays the groundwork for the text by discussing cross-cultural research and the ways in which culture influences our view of self. In the following chapters, Matsumoto focuses on eight topics common in introductory texts: perception, cognition, developmental psychology, language and language acquisition, cognitive development and intelligence, emotion, abnormal psychology, and social psychology. In each of these chapters Matsumoto describes the information typically presented on these topics, discusses the limitations of this knowledge, examines the findings from cross-cultural research that challenge traditional knowledge, and asks how we can better think about this topic to account for diversity. As a supplement to traditional texts, this book introduces students to the complexity and breadth of human experience and encourages students to think critically about ways of evaluating the human experience. 11 chapter with references.

Pearl (covered in its original form in record 1993-97832-000). This book traces early intervention from its legislative origins to how it is done, by whom and for whom, and with what degree of effectiveness. A concluding chapter summarizes the most significant challenges to date, and outlines initiatives for the future. For researchers, the book has more limited value as the reviews are not exhaustive and are sometimes outdated. With regard to teaching, the book is unlikely to be useful as a primary text because of its narrow focus. Professionals from a variety of service-oriented disciplines will gain from this book because they will be able to view the family from a context broader than their own perspective. Its greatest strength is that it provides a complete picture of early intervention. Other strengths include the generally high quality of writing, the frequent cross-referencing from chapter to chapter, and the consistent format whereby individual chapter authors use a final section of concluding comments to summarize and speculate. Most books do have weaknesses, however, and this one is no exception. The absence of an author index is troubling, as well as only occasional mention of cultural variations. With the addition of a multicultural perspective, the book would become truly comprehensive.

Simons and coauthor Irwin examine the human lifespan from prenatal development to death. In between they explore childbirth and the neonatal period, the first two years of infancy, early childhood, middle and late childhood, adolescence, emerging adulthood, middle adult years, later adult years, and the end of the lifespan. The authors offer multicultural information throughout their discussion and include ideas about how gender and age effect development. They balance research findings with practical information to help students gauge how psychological findings are applied in real-world settings. Topics addressed in the chapters include general developmental issues and principles; environmental factors and prenatal development; low-birthweight babies; cognitive development in infants; psychosocial development in infancy; physical and cognitive development throughout the lifespan; parenting and family; adolescent sexuality; models of adult development; personality development in middle adulthood; theories of physical aging; relationships in older adulthood; the process of dying; and bereavement, mourning, and grief.

The book provides a way for 4-8 yr olds and their parents to explore and openly discuss their unspoken feelings, thereby helping the children to build the feelings of self-trust that will enable them to evolve into emotionally well-balanced people. Whether joy or sadness, excitement or anger, confidence or fear, the book addresses a different emotion on each page and asks insightful questions that will result in the fruitful exploration of the child's emotional landscape. In addition, children will identify with the real-life, multicultural illustrations, and the prose will help to enhance the feeling being discussed.

It will therefore be increasingly necessary for therapists to develop multicultural skills and competencies in order to provide treatment which is culturally appropriate. Most mental health practitioners have been seriously undertrained in this area. Most training programs concentrate on developing cultural awareness and competencies in working with clients from different cultures. This article proposes that a shift to a therapist focus is the key to effective multicultural counseling. This approach focuses on developing cultural awareness and personality attributes necessary for multicultural counseling from the perspective of the therapist. The article addresses the subjective experience of the therapist as a person of culture and defines three cultural personality attributes- internalized cultural attitude, transcultural values and multicultural capacities-that depict a multicultural identity, essential to multicultural counseling.

The current study attempted to replicate and extend the findings on social group-based conflict recently proposed by Dunbar et al (1994). Results indicate that 51% of the Ss reported encountering interpersonal conflict attributable to their social group memberships, with ethnicity being the most frequently attributed group category. Significant gender and ethnic differences were noted in the coping approach employed in responding to the conflict event.

Coping strategies are discussed using available literature and the author's personal experiences. The author concludes by recognizing the need for junior faculty to assume an advocacy role for creating a new era of equality and change in academe and in multicultural America.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) [The authors] all centre their attention on the social-relations implied by organizing processes and, in one way or another, take seriously the fundamental relatedness of human life. In other words, that which is taken-for-granted, if not muted to theoretical insignificance in the prevailing entitative perspective, is, in this book, given central voice. Also expressed in this book is the increasingly felt inadequacy of prevailing understandings to deal with the growing complexity and ambiguity, with the rapid changes and the increasingly multicultural organizational world. . . . The topics addressed include leadership and management, the evolution of privileged knowledge, grievances and organizational conflict, and power and politics in organizations. [The authors explore] the potentials for theory lodged neither within the individual nor the social-structural orientations to understanding organizational life. Themes of social construction are woven into these accounts, but remnants of both the individualist and social-structuralist views also are present. The attempt here is not so much to silence these long-standing traditions as to soften their seeming certainties, and thus enable new forms of discourse.

This book gives readers new perspectives from ""insiders"" of the cultures who speak from their own lived experiences. [This book will examine] the day-to-day experiences of homosexuals in the Asia-Pacific region. Topics covered include: social services for gay men and lesbians; health care accessibility for gay men and lesbians; lesbian issues of aging; the impact of AIDS on gay life; law enforcement and police harassment; the decriminalization of homosexuality and gay rights; gay and lesbian families and communities [and] the gay press in Japan and Asia. Authors address the issues of self-recognition, legal status, freedom of choice, health, and social and information needs of gay and lesbian people in particular cultures. Many chapters focus on AIDS and the new demands it places on the gay community. Readers learn how AIDS provides a window of opportunity for gay organizations to be active in countries where there is strong government or social disapproval of homosexuality.

An initial set of in-depth interviews are examined with 6 teachers in 3 different classroom contexts: recently desegregated State schools, private schools, and Black State schools. The analysis of presences and silences within and across teachers' accounts suggest that teachers in multilingual contexts confront and produce language-related dilemmas and a paradox as they manage their teaching.

Results suggest that it may be premature to focus attention on hostility in research on the personality-illness relationship.

The AS is based on the belief that the dominant culture is superior and that those who are different are inferior. It promotes isolation and leads to internalization of racism, poverty, hopelessness, violence and substance abuse. The HHR also teaches that students of color are deficient in some ways. Cultural heroes and heroines are promoted to improve self-esteem and academic achievement.

It is argued that psychoanalysis has always been a deeply multicultural endeavor. The issue of Blackness relates to the reality of racism and the traumatization of Black people in American culture. It is concluded that race and ethnicity are fantasies that people use to deny their badness and displace it onto others, as well as to protect themselves against the hatred that others may have for them.

The most probable of these is the method bias, because intergroup differences in verbal skills and test wiseness affect the items, thereby inducing intergroup differences in average test performance. Research shows that migrants consistently score lower on cognitive tests than natives do, the largest difference occurring in tests with high cultural and verbal loadings. Various remedies are commonly used to enhance the suitability of cognitive tests: Adaptation of existing tests to exclude culture-specific aspects, use of different norms, statistical and linguistic procedures to correct for item bias, and the development of new tests.

The 7 CVs are equality, freedom, justice, truth, prudence, dignity, and altruism. The authors contend that embedded in many of the values described as core to OT are concepts that are founded on the predominantly positivist orientation of Western society, and that to embrace multiculturalism, one has to acknowledge that different cultural groups have different views of, and beliefs about, what is real. It is hoped that Australian occupational therapists reassess the CVs that underlie their practice in order to deliver effective therapy in the increasingly multicultural contexts in which they work.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) An up-to-date and in-depth guide for dealing with teenage fathers, this volume provides a framework for responding to not only the general but also the culturally specific needs of any given unwed teen father. Offering perceptive solutions, the author significantly contributes to the existing literature on how to help teenage men who face unplanned, out-of-wedlock fatherhood by providing clear and concise guidance within the web of legal, family, and personal issues surrounding teenage fatherhood. The book examines the role of the teenage father's relationships-to his parents, his child, the mother of his child and her parents, and his peers-as they relate to his adjustment and changing worldview. While sensitive to cultural considerations, Mark S. Kiselica illuminates ways in which to encourage teenage fathers to take control of their lives and act responsibly regardless of cultural background.

Through insightful chapters based on years of clinical experience, each author helps to redefine psychoanalytic theory by reinventing its foundations from an affirmative perspective so that it better represents all peoples. ""Lesbians and Psychoanalysis"" addresses several topics of emerging concern including multicultural diversity, self-disclosure, homophobia, transference/countertransference issues, bisexuality, and the changing nature of lesbian sexuality. In addition, the authors examine the influence of stigma on human development. In 3 sections . . . the authors in turn critique past theory, discuss current issues in therapy, and describe new directions in theory and practice.

The book offers practical strategies for treating mental disorders in the Filipino American community and outlines how treatment can be made more accessible and effective. The book is filled with vignettes that speak to the psychological well-being of Filipino Americans. . . . The book offers numerous examples that demonstrate the difficulties of cultural adjustment-losses experienced in the immigration process, changes in traditional male-female roles, shame-evoking situations in the workplace-that can lead to depression, anxiety, and brief reactive psychoses. Psychiatrists, psychologists and any professionals who work with Filipino Americans will find this book a valuable tool for providing more accurate assessment of their mental health status and ensuring delivery of appropriate culturally sensitive services.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) The issue of how to provide equitable schooling for females and for ethnic and linguistic minorities has returned to the forefront of educational research, policy, and associated debates. In this volume, [the editors] have brought together top researchers to examine equity from the standpoint of mathematics education. ""New Directions for Equity in Mathematics Education"" positions itself to move beyond old paradigms and ways of looking at the topic. The 1st part addresses broad cultural issues, such as how social class and notions of merit enter into educational discourse on equity. The 2nd part of the book analyzes gender issues in mathematics from feminist and other perspectives. The final part looks at language and mathematics. A number of themes cut across these 3 groupings. For instance, critiques of the current mathematics and school reform movements can be found in several chapters; many chapters look closely at teachers and the dynamics of the classroom; and all 3 sections address issues of teacher empowerment and the re-skilling of teaching as a profession. [This book is intended for] general and mathematics educators, cognitive psychologists, and policymakers.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) This 12th volume of the ""Recent Developments in Alcoholism"" series highlights the remarkable evolution of alcoholism research during the past few years. The importance of gender in alcohol actions and consequences is finally receiving the attention it deserves. Gender differences are critically important because they provide clues to the biological and thus genetic basis of alcohol actions. . . . Section II presents the physiological data on gender differences in alcohol action as well as the genetic underpinning of these differences. Section I, on epidemiology, raises the important, and doubly neglected, area of alcoholism in older women. Many of the issues presented in the epidemiological and sociocultural [Section IV] sections will have important consequences for treatment and are discussed in Section III.

In [the author's] view, the main reason public relations is so tainted and ""preparadigmatic"" is its controversial function in society. We need stronger theory to support a more virtuous practice of institutional communication, theory that both recognizes the inevitability of conflict and diversity and contributes to a more just society. The central argument of this book is that only by focusing on the construction of meaning and the values, patterned activities, and relationships that shape and are shaped by subjective meanings can public relations be truly effective. The social-interpretative approach to multicultural public relations thus joins diversity of experience and values with the ways we categorize groups of people we see as being different.

The book begins with background information on family theories and comparative research methodology, along with an overview of the history of the family and gender relations in the Western world. This is followed by chapters on family variation, which explain research on the origin, functions, and universality of the family; kinship terminology and how kinship affiliation affects such issues as postmarital residence patterns; and the diversity of marital structure (plurality of husbands and/or wives) and how culture and economy affect these patterns. The book examines the life cycle of the family and highlights similarities and differences across time and culture in the areas of mate selection, wedding practices, marital adjustment, childhood socialization, divorce, and care for the elderly. Important contemporary issues seldom covered in earlier works-including gender, class structure, racial discrimination, and poverty-are covered in detail. An ideal text for comparative family courses, this readable and up-to-date volume includes exercises (as well as exercise guidelines for instructors) developed to challenge students' existing viewpoints and offers new ways of looking at the world's families.

This volume familiarizes the reader with the issues to consider in selecting the methodology of a multicultural needs assessment and weighs advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches. This work raises the issues relevant for particular special populations. However, the process by which the relevant factors for these particular special populations are approached is applicable for the assessment of most if not all special populations. Problems and concerns that are significant at every stage of the needs assessment process will be addressed. This book demonstrates how student service professionals might assess the needs of various student populations in an accurate, timely and sensitive manner in order to provide better services for traditionally underserved populations. . . . This book is aimed primarily at professionals in student life and student services with particular emphasis on college and university mental health services. Yet, academic psychologists and counselors as well as those in a variety of settings such as the community mental health center setting will be particularly interested in the proposed methodologies and their multicultural considerations.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) This book is written for anyone interested in people. It is based on the work of Carl Rogers (1902-1987), a psychotherapist, researcher and teacher from the humanistic approach to psychology. Its main concerns are with human growth, development and communication, and its spirit is optimistic for the future of humankind. The book is an invitation to person centred psychology, rather than a comprehensive description of it. Each chapter begins by posing the kind of question that is often asked about people, and then offers some ideas, perspectives and theory that might shed some light-always, of course, from a person centred point of view. Wherever possible, [the author has] included 'real life' case studies and examples in an attempt to show how person centred psychology involves encounters with real people in everyday life. The case studies, with one exception (Jake in Chapter 3), are of real people used either with their permission, or drawn from previously published material.

In the Fall of 1994, 69 chairs/directors of CACREP accredited counseling programs returned surveys (77% return rate) concerning the ethnicity and gender of faculty and students, multicultural program offerings, training and involvement of faculty in multicultural counseling issues, and faculty development needs in multicultural counseling. Using this data, stage of program development in multicultural counseling was determined using the two level/four stage Developmental Perspectives Model (D'Andrea & Daniels, 1991). Results indicated that ethnic minorities were underrepresented as faculty and students and that women were underrepresented as faculty. Eighty-two percent of the programs were at the second (Conscientious) level of program development in the Developmental Perspectives Mode, 91% offered and 88% required a multicultural counseling course. Sixty-two percent of programs integrated multicultural content throughout curriculum and 56% of programs reported 75% or more of faculty had training in multicultural counseling theory and technique. Ethnicity of faculty and involvement of senior faculty in multicultural training activities were found to be significantly related to multicultural program development and recruitment of culturally diverse students. Findings indicated that regional workshops and a national conference on multicultural counseling issues were most needed forms of multicultural training for faculty in programs at lower stages of program development. Accessibility of culturally diverse clients in practica and internships and faculty doing multicultural supervision without training in multicultural theory and technique were identified as areas of concern.

The Hispanic population, especially Mexican-Americans, has among the highest dropout rate of any group in the nation. It is expected that multiculturalism in schools is positively related to perceptions of school achievement and intent to stay in school, and negatively related to dropout rate among Mexican-American children. These general hypotheses are derived from Schema Theory, the Theory of Culture and Cognitive Development, and the theory of Symbolic Interaction. The study examines these theories in relation to perceptions of academic achievement, dropping out, and intention to stay in school among Mexican-American students. It also allows for validation of measures of multiculturalism in the school environment. Conceptually, multiculturalism is a process of developing a ""world view"" which involves sharing another's frame of reference, and, understanding, valuing, and respecting the needs of all students. Operationally, multiculturalism is defined as the degree to which a school values cultural diversity. Student perceptions of the ease with which they learn are used to link the multicultural level of the environment to dropout rate, intention to stay in school, and school achievement (student's perception of own grades). Data was gathered from six school districts in eastern Washington, including twelve schools, sixteen administrators, 108 teachers, and 689 eighth and eleventh graders. The hypotheses at the aggregate (school) level were tested using Analysis of Variance to determine if there were differences among schools in the multicultural level of the school environment in relation to reported dropout rates for the schools. Aggregate level hypotheses were not supported. Individual level (student) hypotheses were tested using a multiple regression analysis.

Acculturation is a multidimensional process whereby acculturating individuals may attain a monocultural, bicultural, or multicultural orientation and identity. An acculturating immigrant faces an existential dilemma between a conservation and formation of his/her self-identity. The research highlights the very personal, individual-specific nature of intercultural experience. In contrast most studies of immigrant acculturation use group populations. Method. A review of the existing literature on this subject was conducted. A scholarly examination of a limited number of studies was performed in order to survey overall methodological strengths and limitations in studies exploring this subject. Results. A sizable body of extremely diversified literature was discovered. Problems inherent in studying the population of interest often contributed to specific methodological weaknesses in the studies reviewed. The findings of this review research suggest that the relationship between identification processes and acculturation is unique. The findings indicate that immigrants tend to develop bicultural identities rather than monocultural identities. They develop a more integrated sense of self, maintain a strong affiliation with family and primary cultural group, and an acceptance of life in the United States.

The stress instrument used represents stress as both occurrence of daily hassles and perceived difficulty dealing with these hassles. Principal Components Analysis of the instrument yielded four factors (Academic Stress, Acculturative Stress, Financial Stress, and Intra-ethnic Stress) which served as the dependent variables in a multivariate analysis. A comparison between the following Asian American ethnic groups: Indian American, Chinese American, Korean American, Filipino American, and Taiwan American found significant differences for Academic and Acculturative Stress.

Team building serves many functions, including improving efficiency of the work group and enhancing individual satisfaction. The current study addressed the issue: To what extent is team building a viable management technique in a multicultural workplace? The study utilized an exploratory, correlational research design. No sampling or experimental interventions were done. Data included both (a) a quantitative component based on questionnaire data completed by production workers, and (b) a qualitative component based on interviews. The quantitative component was the core of the dissertation, with qualitative data used for clarification and additional information. The research setting was a production facility characterized by a multicultural workforce which was primarily Latino. The researcher worked as part of a consulting team charged with implementing the work team concept. Subjects consisted of 180 workers organized into 20 work teams of nine workers each. The workers participated in both quantitative and qualitative components of the study. Descriptive results showed that workers in this multicultural work setting found the team concept comfortable and perceived their work teams as being effective. Scales initially defined, based on a content analysis of items, were used in hypothesis tests; however, these scales had low levels of reliability. The 14 items on the survey instrument were factor analyzed using principal components analysis with oblique rotation, leading to the identification of redefined scales. Multiple regression analysis using these revised scales showed that sense of togetherness was the most important predictor of team effectiveness. Content analysis of interview data suggested that there were conflicts in at least some of the work teams; however, the genera (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","predictors of work team effectiveness in multicultural workplaces, workers","*Personnel

APA ethical guidelines coupled with the changing demographics of North America necessitate psychologists who are competent to work with diverse populations. Clinicians must be able to accurately assess their skills to insure that they are in compliance with APA guidelines. This study examined the relationship between this subjective self-assessment of multicultural competence and an objective self-assessment of multicultural competence. One hundred and seventeen licensed psychologists practicing in California completed the Multicultural Awareness-Knowledge-Skills Survey (MAKSS) and a demographic questionnaire. Fourteen of the subjects were African American, 19 were Asian, 57 were Caucasian and 27 were Latino/a. Results revealed the subjective self-assessment of multicultural competence to be positively related to MAKSS scores. Background variables, ethnicity, predoctoral training, and postdoctoral training, were found to be predictive of multicultural competence as measured by the MAKSS. Specifically, when predoctoral and postdoctoral multicultural training were statistically controlled, African American and Latino/a psychologists rated their competence higher than Asian therapist and Asian therapist rated their competence higher than Caucasian therapist. Through subjective ratings of multicultural competence, psychologists were found to rate themselves as most competent working with their own ethnic group and ethnic minority psychologists were found to rate themselves as more competent working with Caucasians than with the other two ethnic groups. When predoctoral and postdoctoral multicultural training were statistically controlled, significant differences were not found between ethnic minority psychologists and Caucasian psychologists for subjective competency ratings for work with African Americans or Asians. A significant difference was found for sub (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","subjective vs objective self-assessment of multicultural competence, psychologists","*Cultural Sensitivity

In addition, this study examined the relationships between racial identity, ethnic identity, and other-group orientation. Subjects consisted of 418 students (126 Black and 292 White) from two private universities and a public university in the New York City metropolitan area. Results of Pearson product-moment correlations for Blacks revealed that those holding anti-Black/pro-White attitudes showed low ethnic-group attachment, while those having an internalized sense of Blackness showed higher ethnic attachment levels. Among Whites, the results showed no relationship between ethnic and racial group affiliations; however, a significant relationship was found between every level of racial identity development and other-group orientation. In order to examine the relationships among the reference group orientation (RGO) variables (i.e., racial identity and ethnic identity) and self-esteem, several Pearson product-moment correlations and simultaneous multiple regressions were conducted. The results for Blacks indicated that racial and ethnic identity predict a significant proportion of the variability in self-esteem, with Internalization being the most robust predictor. The results for Whites indicated that none of the racial identity scales contribute to the variance in self-esteem, but that ethnic identity does offer a slight explanation of variance. Two distinct orientations to multicultural work--termed ""V-REG"" and ""Salience""--were introduced and defended as theoretical bases for exploring relationships among the variables included in this investigation. Implications for counseling and future research were discussed in relation to these orientations towards multicultural research and practice.

Research on perseverance effects, the tendency of subjects to cling to erroneous beliefs, as well as on the process by which children establish racial attitudes, points to the difficulty in altering racial bias. This dissertation started with the assumption that an authentic, multisource setting would allow students the most efficient opportunity to integrate the diverse aspects of a complex unfamiliar culture into their belief systems. In searching for a way to alter cultural bias in this kind of setting, an authentic multicultural simulation or culture camp was developed. Students in the experimental group spent two days living in a simulated Mexican village. They slept on floor mats in mud adobe houses, ground corn to make tortillas, heard and used only Spanish to communicate, and celebrated a Mexican holiday. Each child was assigned a role to assume in the simulation such as mother, priest, beggar, vendor, and so on. Subjects in the control group were taught about Mexican culture using traditional teaching methodology. Subjects in both groups were given pretreatment and posttreatment tests to measure cultural bias, using the Katz-Zalk Opinion Questionnaire, a socialization choice measure, and an activity choice measure. Subjects in both the experimental group and the control group were also given a cultural knowledge test to measure their knowledge of Mexican village culture before and after their learning experiences. As predicted, all three measures of cultural bias revealed a significant interaction (p <01). Somewhat unexpectedly, the control group showed an increase from pretreatment to posttreatment in cultural bias scores, while the experimental group showed a decrease, as predicted. Results of the cultural knowledge test were not as clear. These showed a significant (p <) increase in knowledge of Mexican village culture for both gro (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","multicultural simulation as means of teaching culture, cultural bias & socialization choice & activity choice, students, Mexico","*Choice Behavior

It is predicted that by the year 2000 approximately one third of the United States will be racial and ethnic minorities. The Hispanic population is predicted to reach 55 million by the year 2000 and will constitute the largest ethnic minority group by the year 2025. Within the total population of Hispanic Americans, Mexican Americans constitute the largest subgroup with a population of approximately 13,312,000. The rapid increase of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States makes it imperative that mental health professionals develop effective, culturally sensitive treatment strategies and techniques. The purpose of this study was to see if the counselor's use of language influenced the perceived credibility of counseling with bilingual Mexican-American clients. Specifically, this study examined whether bilingual Mexican Americans have preferences for and positive attitudes toward bilingual counselors. Sixty-two bilingual Mexican-American outpatients from the West Texas area were be recruited for this study. The subject, ranging from 18 to 56 years of age, were assigned randomly to one of three treatment groups and viewed a videotaped enactment of a segment of a counseling session. After viewing the videotape, each subject completed a Personal Data Form, a Counselor Rating Form (CRF-S), and a Self-Disclosure Questionnaire (SDQ-25). The data collected from the three groups was analyzed to determine if differences existed in the perceptions of the subjects toward the counselor in the videotape. It was hypothesized that the bilingual counselor would be rated significantly more favorably on the CRF-S and the SDQ-25.

The initial study, investigating whether AIDS knowledge and related attitudes could be measured reliably in the sample population of adults and children across different acculturation levels, was successful. These findings lead to a reassessment of the acculturation rating scale. Using a Phi-approach to focus the scale items, the measure was successfully refined. AIDS-related knowledge differences were explored as a consequence of acculturation. Results indicate that differences in AIDS knowledge exist among adults and children of different acculturation levels; Hispanics adults and children demonstrating significant lower levels of AIDS-relevant knowledge. Further analyses were conducted to assess whether acculturation or SES is the most accurate predictor of AIDS knowledge for Hispanic and Anglo parents and children. As predicted, acculturation level is a significant predictor of differences between extreme AIDS knowledge groups for Hispanic parents and children. However, the prediction that SES is a significant predictor of Anglo parent's and children's AIDS knowledge was not supported. It was also predicted that parent's AIDS knowledge would be predictive of children's knowledge, and children's AIDS knowledge predictive of parent's knowledge level. Specifically, the results indicate that the amount of correct AIDS information exhibited by parents is more predictive of what their children know than the converse. Finally, the investigation found that the AIDS-related beliefs of moralism, blame, and perceived control over contracting AIDS is associated with acculturation.

The religious function is stressed, along with the psychological or expressive, ideological or cultural, and social. ""Religion,"" ""religious"" and ""spiritual"" are broadly defined as the sacred in relationship to time and space, as well as symbol and myth. Magic, play and art, as well as etiquette, are discussed as part of healthy ritualization as distinguished from pathological ritualism. Creating rituals with children as active participants requires attention to individual differences and stages of development. Rites of passage or transition--birth, initiation, marriage, death--are discussed as the circle of life. Youth, adolescence, puberty, sexuality, and gender are mentioned--particularly in relationship to initiation. Calendrical or seasonal rituals--ranging from daily mealtimes and bedtimes to yearly festivals--put the individual in context of a larger whole. Homecoming, good-bye, thanks, and storytelling--along with some theory of children's literature--are included. The role of domestic ritual is a focus and attitudes toward the feminine are involved. The traditional elements of ritual--including architecture, costumes, gifts, light, candles, incense, flowers, theater, drama, music, dance, sports, games--are outlined. Special attention is given to food as an element of ritual--because of its symbolic importance in childhood and the prevalence of eating disorders in this culture. Meaningful rituals contribute to bonding of the individual with both the community and the cosmos. Benefits include reverence and respect for the interdependence of all including multicultural concerns and appreciation for nature and ecology. Likewise, many of the crises of modern societies are partly the result of secularization and deritualization. The foresight of ritual is compared to the hindsight of therapy.

The women defined success, described by both tangible and intangible elements unique to each. This study does not claim the women have complete or ongoing control over their lives; rather, it speculates as to how they encounter, react to, and master their environments differently from each other, given the varied situations they face in the new culture. The research questions asked (1) how poor immigrant women improved their lives in the face of obstacles; (2) what founded their coping strategies; and (3) whether their strategies suggest improved policy, services, and research regarding immigrant women. To answer these questions, data were interpreted through Brislin's and Lewis and Jungman's (1980, 1986) stages of cross-cultural adjustment which helped identify the women's awareness that they could function in the host culture and ultimately separate from home. Berry's (1990a) framework for immigrant adaptation in multicultural societies helped identify the women's identity integration of homeland and host culture. Finally, Bandura's (1978) self-efficacy theory helped to understand how the women rewarded their own behaviors to persist in greater mastery, used familiar models for expanded achievement, and evaluated and motivated themselves through goal-setting. First, the women improved their lives by creating personal definitions of success within the new culture and changing their perceptions and beliefs to master fearful situations. The question of success became an inquiry into its cultural and personal meaning. Second, their coping strategies were derived from their individual persistence, past cultural values and behavioral models, increasing participation in United States life, and psychological task-oriented strategies--goal-setting and coping through retreat (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","coping strategies, poor women immigrants","*Acculturation

A heuristic qualitative research model was utilized in conducting this study. This model functioned in providing a structure for me, the researcher, to interact with the co-researchers through sharing our experiences and allowing the data to emerge from those experiences rather than bringing pre-conceived ideas searching for validation. Data was collected with co-researchers in Venezuela and in British Columbia, Canada through the process of in-depth open-ended interviews, direct observation and written documents. I also made extensive use of audio and video tapes as instruments of recording both experiential data and evaluative interviews. Academic research and evaluation research are distinguished by Patton (1990) in the following ways. ""Basic research is judged by its contribution to theory and why things occur as they do. Applied evaluative research is judged by its usefulness in making human actions and interventions more effective by its practical utility to decision makers, policy makers, and others who have a stake in efforts to improve the world"" (p.12). This study is an applied evaluative research project moving the focus away from mechanistic behaviour toward a ""whole person"" multicultural emphasis. The research focus remains on the human process evolving within each co-researcher. Always in the forefront of this study are the human stories reflecting the multi-dimensional facets of human evolvement and adaptation for survival. The Satir family systems model meets each person as a precious miracle of life to be respected and honoured in a process of creating new possibilities for healing, development and survival.

It was postulated that there are two different types of feminism: one which focuses primarily on gender discrimination, and the other which focuses on tolerance for diversity of others and working toward solidarity with others. It was hypothesized that the gender-based feminism would be significantly related to structural systems of domination, including systems where Caucasian people hold much of the power. To explore these hypotheses, a survey questionnaire (developed by the author) was utilized to measure African American and Caucasian women's support toward feminism limited to gender oppressions (Gender-Based Feminism), values toward feminism (Pluralistic Feminism) based on women working together as a collective (Solidarity) and tolerating differences of others (Tolerance for Diversity), endorsement of a system where people maintain power over others (Dominator Model), support of a system where White people should be in charge (White Authority), and a belief that White people do not have or should not address their racial identity (Lack of White Identity). In addition, African American women were requested to complete the Womanist Identity Scale (WIS) to determine their stage of ethnic and feminist identity development (Fujino et al., 1993). Exploratory questions in the survey (for all women) asked women to indicate degree of self-identification as feminists, and descriptions of attitudes toward the feminist movement. One hundred-three adult African American and Caucasian women, between the ages of 18 and 72 participated in the study. Hypotheses were supported in that the more women endorsed Solidarity, the more they supported Tolerance for Diversity. Provocative results found differences between African American and Caucasian women's attitudes toward White Authority and Lack of White Identity, and are discussed in the final chapter.

This study focused on a theoretically grounded training program designed to develop culturally effective employees. The training program was modified for three sample groups of employees with differential training schedules and based on the developmental stage of each group's participants. Research on cognitive-developmental theory and intentionally structured groups provided the theoretical and empirical support for designing and implementing the in-service training. The purpose of this study was twofold. The study examined the relationship between moral development, racial identity development, and knowledge about diversity issues. The study evaluated the effectiveness of the training program and differential training schedules by examining racial awareness, appreciation, and stereotypes. The study followed a quasi-experimental design using three intact groups evaluated with a pretest and posttest. The Defining Issues Test, Racial Identity Attitude Scale, and Diversity Awareness Assessment were used as estimates of cognitive-developmental level, racial identity development, and knowledge about diversity issues, respectively. Qualitative data was extracted from five sources. Analysis of the results indicated equivalency of the groups on the pretest measure except for sample group two's significantly higher scores on measures of knowledge about diversity issues. Sample group two's scores reflected an increase on the measure of moral development. Study results hinted at differences between group scores on the measure of racial identity development. Sample group two appeared to show increased attitudes of racial tolerance and appreciation. Evaluation of factual information results was mixed.

Will), (2) neurotheology (James B. Ashbrook), and (3) social systems analysis (Solomon Cytrynbaum) were useful to contribute to the development of a multi-cultural pastoral hermeneutics that is culturally sensitive to diverse forms of human suffering. Its more specific concern is to analyze the causes and the resolution of the Han of the Korean Minjung. The analysis explicates the religious context, the neurocognitive processes and social dynamics as a concrete illustration of an effective pastoral hermeneutics. The contributions of this study may be briefly summarized: First, the Shamanistic Kut and mask dance are analyzed using theological, neuropsychological and social systems perspectives. Second, the theological method of dialectical panentheism is used to interpret the Minjung's understanding of God, and the possibility of their personal, social and natural transformation in the context of oppression and injustice. Dialectical panentheism enables a dialogical interpretation of the Shamanistic resolution of Han. Third, neurotheology is articulated in the concrete situation of Han to illumine the healing processes of the rituals in mind-body modulation and meaning-making, which is analogous to the Western understanding of psychoneuroimmunology. Fourth, some parallels are drawn between social systems thinking and the processes of these rituals. The way in which the Kut and the mask dance help bring healing to ""Hwabyung,"" a culture-bound psychiatric illness in Korea, is interpreted in the light of the Group Relations Conference (GRC) model. Finally, these considerations are drawn together to articulate a useful multi-cultural pastoral hermeneutics to help pastors, pastoral counselors and cross-cultural psychiatrists to analyze diverse contemporary forms of suffering in a multi-cultural and post-modern age.

In the present study, a memory research model was employed to investigate the influence of cultural variables on the cognitive processing of session-related material. Fifty Anglo-American graduate students enrolled in Clinical or Counseling Psychology programs were shown a videotape of a fictional initial psychotherapy session. Subjects saw either an Anglo- or an African-American client and then completed a free recall written description of the videotaped interaction followed by a multiple choice recognition memory test. Subjects were also asked to provide information about their reactions to the videotapes. This included inquiries about the credibility of the vignettes, whether or not subjects would accept the featured individual as their client, and similar factors. It was found that, as a group, the two subject samples (Anglo- or African-American client) did not differ in terms of the level of encoding of information presented or in terms of the amount or type of inferential statements they generated. However, subjects who had viewed the African-American client generated a greater number of factual statements and made fewer errors on the free recall task than did subjects who viewed the Anglo-American client. Additional group differences included the finding that the fictional African-American client was rated as more likable but less believable than the fictional Anglo-American client. Thus, while no support was found for the hypothesis that subjects in the two experimental groups would differentially encode information and make differential judgments about the two clients, some evidence for race-specific effects was in fact obtained. In addition to the multicultural hypotheses, data from the study suggest that clinicians-in-training do not always phrase their judgments in ways that acknowledge the tentative underpinnings of the statements they make.

As members of special education evaluation teams, school psychologists' duties and diagnostic decisions have changed under the REI. Conversely, school psychologists' recommendations for services to special education students have affected the implementation of the REI. This investigation explored the perceptions held by school psychologists to understand each practitioner's unique attitudes and the experiences of their role under the REI. The literature review provided historical background pertaining to special needs legislation at both the state and federal levels. Issues surrounding the REI and its implementation in Massachusetts were considered. The role of the school psychologist was explored to provide a backdrop with respect to their past and present operation. The investigator employed qualitative methodology to solicit primary source data involving sensitive career-related questions under naturalistic conditions. These required the individualized approach facilitated by the intimacy and confidentiality of the in-depth interview. A representative sample of active practitioners was employed and the setting selected was a multicultural, urban school system in Massachusetts. Three interdependent procedures were utilized as sources of evidence: focused, in-depth interviews with five key informants (Seidman, 1991), interviews with informed sources, and document and record analysis. First, a series of three focused interviews explored the participant's background, contemporary experience under inclusion, and the meaning made of that experience. Second, interviews with informed sources including the superintendent, two special education administrators, and seven principals were conducted to derive additional viewpoints on the school psychologists' roles and the R (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",The role and influence of the school psychologist in decision-making: The regular education initiative,"*Decision Making

The quantitative aspects of this study, directed at a more efficient diagnostic process, involved a nationwide intense clinical sample of 30 Caucasian females with diagnoses of MPD, assessed with both the MCMI-II and a demographic questionnaire. The results show an MPD profile on the MCMI-II that is above a Base Rate (BR) of 74 on scales X (Disclosure), Y (Debasement), 2 (Avoidant), 8A (Passive-Aggressive), 8B (Self-Defeating), C (Borderline), and D (Dysthymic Disorder), with 78% of the sample being identified by BR scores above 74 on scales 2 and 8B, or 2 and 8A. There was great intragroup variability which suggests that further research in this area may identify MPD subsets on the MCMI-II. The second purpose of the study, providing clinical insight about MPD patient's lived lives, was addressed through qualitative analysis of therapy experiences and case notes of 20 patients over eight years. Triangulation of data from therapy and current literature led to the identification of therapy issues organized into 10 themes. The history of child abuse was chronicled, as this is the trauma that most often underlies the disorder, and the history of MPD was explored. The multicultural manifestations of MPD were discussed, with particular attention to findings in Japan, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and India. Both the etiology and symptomology of MPD were discussed. The findings on the MCMI-II are a new contribution to the literature and the identification of therapy themes is an extension of current literature.

Ss were 226 White, African-American, and Hispanic students in 6 5th-grade and 6 7th-grade classes from a rural school district. Four short stories representative of the African-American, White, and Hispanic cultures were read to each class, and Ss then wrote their own comments and rated each story on a scale of 1-5. Responses were analyzed for aesthetic involvement using an instrument developed by D. Wiseman et al (1992). Fifth-grade Ss preferred White stories, while 7th-grade Ss preferred African-American stories. Minority Ss preferred stories about their own culture, but preference did not inhibit the Ss' ability to become aesthetically involved in the stories. It was also revealed that those of the majority culture were much more homogeneous in their preference for stories. The study emphasizes the importance of using multicultural literature in the classroom.

Experiences were analyzed, including the goals of multicultural education, the monocultural dimensions of high school curricula, and the possible impact of a multicultural curriculum and school attitudes. The discussions suggested that curriculum design should reflect contributions and perspectives of various groups to address student alienation and prejudiced, discriminatory behaviors that they encountered, and it should be inclusive of all students. Findings revealed that minority students cared very deeply about their education and validated the goals and practices advocated in multicultural education literature.

It is written to target those students who are interested in further exploring the family realm. In Part I, we explore 4 contexts within which families thrive-larger societal value systems, ideologies about connectedness, gender formulations, and cultural difference. In Part II, we examine the theoretical and scientific approaches used by family scientists as they try to understand family interaction. In Part III, we give the reader a more in-depth view of the processes families use as they move through their days, solve problems, and make life's decisions. We analyze how family members communicate, parent, and resolve sexual problems. Part IV presents several topics relating to family changes. [It discusses] topics from a systemic viewpoint and [illuminates] processes the families use in periods of crisis. Part V [discusses] what a person does when he or she wants to work in this field.

An increased awareness was the change most often reported by the Ss. Interpersonal exchanges in class were seen as the most important factor in helping Ss achieve changes. Lack of time and personal biases were seen as hindering changes of their views of different cultures. The most immediate concern of the Ss was integrating classroom information into counseling practice. Findings indicate that a multicultural course will be most helpful if taken early in the Ss' training.

Results show that ethnic minority psychologists are prolific mentors of both ethnic minority and European American students, interns, and novice professionals. 70% of the respondents said they had mentored at least 1 student or intern and collectively, they had mentored 214 ethnic minority and 88 European American proteges; the majority of the proteges were women.

A considerable amount of training should be devoted to ensuring that interviewers understand the dynamics of the interview decision-making process. Four points are emphasized within the area of employment interviews: (1) interviews will continue to be used despite their limitations; (2) civil actions against discriminative personnel actions will continue increasing; (3) as the work force becomes more multicultural, the IVP may be invalidated even more; and (4) labor unions should be involved.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Peru, as a multilingual and multicultural country, with differing and sometimes even antagonistic values and modes of conduct, poses a challenge to psychologists in relation to the instruments and techniques that they use. Rorschach psychodiagnosis, because of the breadth and variety of the information that it reveals, makes it possible to study the structure and contents of normal personality and also to diagnose psychopathology. Above all in its importance for our country, being an unstructured instrument in which the instructions have little influence, it can be applied to different groups independently of their culture, sex, or age. The present article consists of a brief historical review of the Rorschach method in Peru since its introduction. We identify the areas of work in which it has been utilized as well as the approaches most often used, the research studies that have been conducted, and perspectives for the future. Research, the basis of scientific knowledge, constitutes the central point of our presentation, because it indicates the development of the technique and its present status in all fields of psychological endeavor, including clinical, educational, social, industrial, and forensic psychology, and its place in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and teaching. It is not possible to recount the development of a technique without relating it to the investigative efforts that allow for its evaluation and improvement.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Editorial,"A society must impart rules, rituals, and beliefs to its youth if it intends to survive for more than a single generation. How our society fulfills this mission is now at the center of heated debate: whose rules? whose rituals? whose beliefs? As our country moves away from the 19th century's cookie-cutter conception of mass schooling and heads toward the high-tech and multi-ethnic 21st century, we must redefine our educational goals. We still intend to deliver an education to all of our country's children, but how we do it remains an open question. The education debate never really goes away; it just changes topics. Many years ago, controversy swirled around compulsory attendance and teaching evolution theory. Today, the arguments rage over multicultural and Afrocentric curricula. At stake is the ultimate cultural prize: the education of our children. The United States is the only country both fortunate and plagued at the same time to have citizens who hail from nearly every ethnic stock on the globe. The survival of the American experiment requires that we continue to balance the delicate demands of this fragile pluralism. Many educators now suggest that black children, who face a unique set of obstacles, retreat into the racial enclave of Afrocentrism. But Afrocentrism is no magic bullet. It risks balkanizing our children--and ultimately our nation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","Afrocentrism, society, teaching evolution, curriculum","*Curriculum

This collection of readings provides an important response to the challenge of diversity in the academy. The book is divided into three major sections: New Perspectives on Teaching and Learning, Social Diversity in the Curriculum, and Cultural Pluralism and Core Curricula. The first section introduces a model in Chapter 1 that describes four critical dimensions of learning and teaching that affect diverse student bodies. The second section highlights social diversity in the curriculum and begins with Noronha's thesis that the relationship between multicultural and international education needs to be discussed and debated within the context of campus diversity. The final section presents the reader with an overview of the experiences and issues different types of institutions encounter as they implement change in response to shifting campus demographics.

The four sections of this book each discuss the cultural concerns specific to these four groups. The authors examine alternative approaches to and recommend strategies for clinical intervention. A unique and important feature of this book is the inclusion of a case study with questions and a role-playing exercise at the end of each section.

His writings are congruent with the thinking of others such as Sander, Stierhn, and Wachtel and Wachtel. Deftly, he interweaves individual and life cycle developmental concepts within a broad multicultural perspective. Lidz succeeds quite well in fulfilling his objective of demonstrating that ""a life and a person's psychic or intrapsychic processes cannot be properly understood without consideration of the family structure and transactions in which the individual grew up."" This book should constitute core reading for both psychoanalysts who are willing to broaden and enrich their knowledge base and clinical skills and family therapists interested in expanding their depth of awareness of the personality dynamics and functioning of the individuals who comprise families.

The themes published in this volume and in its several predecessors take their proper place in juxtaposition to the growing database of our discipline. The subject matter seems to engage us in ways that are antithetical to a search for the unity in our diversity--or a healthy respect for our differences. Curricular transformation, however, requires a Cartesian-like rethinking of fundamental assumptions about knowledge and its authority. There is not a unity of viewpoints in this volume. The many chapters collectively point toward a developing Afrocentric perspective as a means of broadening our understanding of behavior--especially the behavior of Blacks. True to its editor's intent, Black Psychology should be a productive resource for advanced students and professionals interested in a multicultural emphasis in curriculum and research.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In this chapter, the author describes how cultural therapy was adapted to a group process to report the results of an ethnographic study of cultural transmission in an elementary school with a culturally diverse student population and a staff that is largely mainstream American. The author considered the resistant reactions of some of the participants as expressions of an enduring professional self that was threatened by the changing nature of the school and the resultant changing nature of teaching. She saw this resistance manifested in nonparticipation and less than enthusiastic responses to the content of the sessions. Initially, her view had been that the sessions were not successful because there were not enough people there, because she did not lead the sessions effectively, and because the teachers were exhibiting racism. The Spindlers' viewpoint (G. and L. Spindler, see record 2001-06514-001) that one can objectify and depersonalize problems by seeing them through a cultural framework, was, however, instructive. Using the ideas of the enduring self and seeing the events from a cultural perspective helped the author to understand the value of this process. The result was a clearer understanding of the power of the enduring self that teachers construct.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Traditional counseling theories have frequently been criticized for their lack of multicultural relevance, yet even today many UK counselors assume a prevailing white (and middle class) culture. The summary of research findings in multicultural counseling presented in this article had to rely entirely on evidence from the US, since very little comparable work has been done in the UK. The 1st section gives a brief overview of the current research in multicultural counseling, emphasizing its lack of agreed findings and the limitations in methodology. It then focuses on 3 major questions, asking whether counselor race/ethnicity, explicit multicultural counselor education, and current research affect the counseling process and outcome. The 2nd section considers several research proposals that seem to have particular relevance to the issues discussed.

They are alert to the question of what purposes and whose interests are and should be served by psychiatric classification systems.

Cross-cultural research in this volume helps identify the kind of universality being claimed for moral stages. It also clarifies differences between moral reasoning, orientation, and ideology. Individual studies from China, Korea, India, Poland, Israel, and Turkey, plus reviews of the cross-cultural literature, basically support this unlikely claim.

To do so, community psychology needs to move beyond the teaching of culturally sensitive research and practice to a reconceptualization of the knowledge base and methods of community psychology, to an examination of the conflicts engendered by the inclusion of multiple voices, and to the implementation of institutional arrangements that can support such a challenging task in constructive ways.

Survey responses could be grouped into 3 general headings: openness and support, culturally relevant supervision, and opportunities to work in multicultural activities. Seven suggestions were offered for making individual supervision more multiculturally sensitive and effective. Based on the findings of this pilot study, it is recommended that supervisors receive training in multicultural issues and that supervisors initiate discussion of multicultural issues with supervisees.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Summarizes some salient points vis-a-vis multicultural training for professional counseling practitioners. First, students should not be viewed as coming from the same cultural background solely on the basis of similar racial features. Cultural sensitivity helps students gain the skills to engage in public discourse with people different from themselves. The diversity of student populations should not govern vocational choice or career assistance. Home-culture and school-culture mismatch is a key factor in high dropout rates among Hispanics and Native Americans. Language and cultural values can impede cross-cultural communication. Guidance counselors should encourage minority students to take high-level academic, as well as vocational, courses. Finally, all counselors benefit from a knowledge of attitudes, beliefs, and other factors relating to various subcultures.

Only supervision provided to interns in a multicultural setting correlated significantly with multicultural awareness, thus accounting for only 3% of the variability in interns' multicultural awareness.

It is suggested that neither of these movements will affect the problems of minorities who have not traditionally done well in school because they are not based on a good understanding of cultural diversity or the cultural differences of minority groups. The primary and secondary cultural differences of autonomous, voluntary minorities (VMs), and involuntary minorities (IMs) are distinguished, and the different relationships of minority groups to the mainstream culture are described. The educational implications of these differences are examined for VMs who have more social pressure to do well in school and IMs who have less.

Authored Book",,"(from the publicity materials) Studies show that childhood prejudice stems in the 1st place from cognitive immaturity, that is, from children's inability to reason about other people. This finding is important because it means that children can be taught to recognize the fallacies in their thinking and be made aware of prejudiced assumptions and attitudes, even when their parents or community cannot. Working with psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg and feminist scholar Carol Gilligan, Florence Davidson designed her research around a cross-section of urban and suburban students in Boston [MA] area public schools, with long term studies of students from grade 5 through grade 12. She shows that during childhood much adult-like prejudice is actually a temporary tactic to preserve self-esteem. When education fosters higher stages of moral judgement, her case studies and tests involving spontaneity show increasing degrees of respect for ethnically different people. The 2nd half of the book is devoted to means by which parents and others can take responsibility for changing prejudice and moral judgement in children and adolescents. How whole school reform can bring about Stage 3, being helpful and seeking other's approval, is covered in detail. Stage 4, recognition of the value of social order, should be an essential goal of high schools.

The book examines similarities as well as differences in the experiences of diverse groups-including ethnic and racial minority groups, gays and lesbians, the elderly, and others-highlighting crosscutting themes such as oppression, intergroup dynamics, culture, and identity. Taken together, these varying perspectives show how each group has developed a distinctive history and reached its current situation. The authors also explore the application of varying approaches to diversity to the research process and offer practical guidelines on how to conduct diversity-conscious and diversity-sensitive projects and research.

Edited Book",,"(from the postscript) [This book] merges the companion areas of cultural diversity, criminal justice, and criminology. In so doing, this anthology introduces the reader to multiculturalism and the fields of criminal justice and criminology with special emphasis on policy implications and criminal justice system responses. Additionally, the volume allows for a convergence of theory and practice when examining the role and function of multiculturalism and diversity with criminal justice and criminology. Moreover, we present . . . various perspectives with a focus on multiculturalism in criminal justice theory, practice, and research. It is our belief that the volume may be delineated based on 4 key topical themes. These include (1) the significance and inclusion of diverse groups within criminal justice, (2) inclusion of, and the analysis of, diverse groups in reference to criminal justice practice and criminological scholarship, (3) emerging diversity issues within criminal justice practice, and finally (4) the importance of education and training with a multicultural focus.
(from the introduction) This book should appeal to those teaching undergraduate or graduate courses in criminal justice or criminology. It should also be of particular interest to criminal justice personnel, criminologists, and students of criminal justice/criminology with an interest in diversity issues. It may also be of interest to those instructors teaching in African-American Studies, Ethnic Studies, or Women's Studies programs at various schools or within related courses in multiculturalism.

The author criticizes both sides of the debate, rejecting, on the one hand, calls for a uniform, chronological history curriculum and, on the other hand, claims that only ethnic or racial ""insiders"" are qualified to teach about their communities. In chapters on colonial, comparative, and African history, Williams applies the concept of ""Gandhian truth"" to historical subjects, moving through tentative and flexible perspectives to achieve a complex picture of historical episodes. And in chapters on imperialism, nationalism, racism, and the problem of ""the other,"" he discusses the difficult and contingent nature of conceptual language. He addresses framing rules of discussion by which sensitive issues can be discussed with diverse audiences, the relationship of American pluralism to a world perspective, and what can be accomplished through an education in pluralism.

Edited Book",,"(from the introduction) This book considers the promise and perils of the education reform movement for students from non-English language backgrounds and the implications of increased linguistic diversity for American education. The students who are the subject of this book include those whose native or home language is other than English. The major concern of the book is the large proportion of such students with poor academic achievement. The 1st section focuses specifically on reform, discussing the relationship between reform proposals and the educational needs of these students, and exploring the power of language in education and reform. The 2nd section addresses cultural diversity in curriculum, pedagogy, and staffing in relation to the education of students from English-language and other-language backgrounds. The 3rd section summarizes research on teaching language arts, and the last section discusses research on teaching mathematics and science to students from non-English language backgrounds. The purpose . . . is to discuss the challenges faced by these students, and by the schools responsible for educating all students.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) This book introduces multiculturalism and its relationship to education and schooling, while also highlighting current approaches to multicultural education and placing them in a broad comparative and international context. Through a comparative view that is both domestic and international, the book explores ethnicity, race, class, and education (kindergarten through higher education) as they interact to integrate populations, while also serving vested interests and enhancing group identity and status. The authors position multiculturalism as a political and social phenomena that affects and interacts with education and its institutions. To do this, they draw upon international cases as well as the history of segmentation and integration in the US.

An intrapersonal grid is presented to identify how an accurate assessment of behaviors depends on identification of matching expectations and values that are learned in a sociocultural context. The danger of misattribution in identifying expectations accurately is discussed in relation to an interpersonal grid that separates behaviors from expectations. Multicultural mediation can best be accomplished by identifying common ground of shared positive expectations and not being distracted by ""undesirable"" behaviors. Case illustrations are provided.

The case of a 15-yr-old rape victim, born in India and living in a Hindu community in the US for 6 yrs, illustrates the senior author's experience in coping with a specific value conflict. In this case the victim recanted, recognizing that the consequences of having been raped were greater than those of lying. The conflict was not between counselor and client but within the counselor, who tried unsuccessfully to resolve problems within the client's frame of reference. It is suggested that as counselors become more proficient in multicultural counseling and more able to promote decision making from another's point of view, feelings of internal conflict will decrease. Guidelines for resolving value conflicts in cross-cultural counseling are offered.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Describes how Nigrescence models attempt to capture the stages that African-Americans traverse when experiencing a major shift in their racial identification. These models begin with people who place low salience on being Black, but, in the aftermath of a challenging encounter, move to find a way to change their identity to make it reflect high salience for race. They immerse themselves in a transition stage, the core of which reveals a war between the old and emergent identities. They may progress to a point where the new identity takes hold and is internalized and habituated. In some cases, they evolve still further to embrace a multicultural perspective, including a rapprochement with aspects of White culture. This conversion may support even further growth in the future, as one makes adjustments to new identity questions that are presented over the course of a life span.

This book may be of considerable help to graduate programs in school, clinical, and counseling psychology where accreditation requirements need to be defined by a program and met through specific coursework. The book meets the expectations set forth in the Introduction quite well Issues such as assessment or the role of testing in the multicultural format are not discussed, but they might have added substantially to the complexity of this volume. For an introductory treatment of the complex issues of multicultural components in American society, this book admirably summarizes the background, history, and current problems of each of these groups. It should be useful in both undergraduate and graduate courses as an introductory statement of the problems.

Knight (1992); and Aging and Mental Disorders: International Perspectives edited by Manfred Bergener, Kazuo Hasegawa, Sanford I. Finkel, and Tsuyoshi Nishimura (1992). These two books approach the inherent problems from different levels of analysis. The former is a review of the more common degenerative brain diseases with a special emphasis on their neuropsychological aspects. The latter focuses on new societal challenges created by the combination of the lengthening of the life span and a change in family structure. Both books are a timely presentation of information and ideas that are shaping decisions about caring for elders. However, they are quite different in organization and appeal. Knight admirably achieves his goal of succinctly reviewing current clinical and research knowledge of degenerative brain diseases in a format valuable to the clinician. Second book is likely to be of interest to mental health educators and policy administrators where a multicultural view of aging and dementia offers a fresh perspective to pressing societal problems.

Berry Brazelton (see record 1991-98572-000). Infants vary in the breadth, style, and organization of their behaviors nearly as much as possible. Multicultural and Interdisciplinary Approaches to Parent-Infant Relations is Volume 2 of the Cultural Context of Infancy series. Volume 2 is divided into three parts (each with 3-4 chapters) concerned serially with newborn behavior and later development, mother interaction in context, and cultural perspectives on the high-risk infant and family. More particularly, contributions in this volume cross the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (as indicative of infant status and behavioral organization) with culture, with the aim of elucidating these several topics. Thus, the contributions in this volume do not report cross-cultural studies per se, but empirical investigations of newborn performance and its implications and interactions with parenting contextualized by culture. The present volume aims to broaden traditional examinations of the nature of maternal behaviors in the period of the dyad's initial accommodation by including interactions of mothers with their infants across diverse cultural settings.

Reviews the book, Racially Mixed People in America by Maria P. P. Root (Ed.) (see record 1992-97305-000). In this edited volume, Root presents a new paradigm for the emerging multiracial population in America. The call for deconstruction of existing theory and the creation of new paradigms for understanding and investigating the multicultural experience is a major premise of this book. Existing social, political, and theoretical frameworks--based on monocultural, monoracial, linear models of social relations and social identity--have forced biracial individuals to choose one or the other culture and to deny significant parts of their heritage and existence. These models mirror the dichotomous, forced choice schemes of racial classification. This volume seeks to correct these practices and perceptions by presenting alternative approaches to social identity and racial classification based on the incorporation of simultaneous membership and multiple, fluid identities.

Reviews the book, Multicultural Issues in Counseling: New Approaches to Diversity by Courtland C. Lee and Bernard L. Richardson (Eds.) (1991). The volume's purpose is to present direction for culturally responsive counseling in a variety of settings. Each chapter includes a discussion of relevant history and cultural dynamics that shape the mental health issues for each selected group and provides descriptions of counseling interventions, case studies, and strategies. A unique contribution of this volume is the depth of specificity the authors achieve in their individual chapters. Although the editors stress the importance of multicultural skills development, many of the chapters describe cultural skills that are acquired by being a member of that cultural group (e.g., bilingual skills). The suggestions of the authors expand definitions of mental health services for culturally diverse populations, yet the application of these suggestions remains a challenge for the psychology faculty member or well-intentioned practitioner or administrator.

Reviews the book, Women, Relationships, and Power: Implications for Counseling edited by Ellen Piel Cook (see record 1992-98780-000). It is difficult to find a book on women's issues that combines scholarly sophistication with an articulation of the social, cultural, political, and personal experiences of women. This is such a book. The first two chapters of this book provide a conceptual-theoretical framework for understanding the role of gender in women's lives, specifically the impact of a relational, as opposed to an individualistic, individualistic, orientation and the role of power differences experienced by women and their capacity to promote the devaluation, restriction, and violation of women. Subsequent chapters address specific issues (intimate relationships, career- work issues, depression, reproductive life cycle issues, eating disorders and addictions, and internalized misogyny) and how the engendered context of women's lives affects these issues. Every chapter provides an integration of relevant research and a discussion of counseling implications, including the presentation of a clinical example at the end of most chapters to illustrate the content of that chapter. Of particular note are issues of diversity-specifically multicultural, lesbian, and socioeconomic issues--that are addressed in every chapter. A strength of this book is its translation of science and theory into practice, thus, it would be most appreciated by helping professionals or persons in training for a helping profession.

They consider family violence from theoretical, empirical, legal, and treatment vantage points. The theoretical material includes discussion and critique of various models of family violence, including the feminist model. Legal scholars address judicial options for the battered woman and delineate therapists' ethical duties when treating violent families. . . . Several contributors review the meager body of scholarship in this field to date and observe that little of it has been notably feminist in theoretical underpinnings.

The CPERC consists of 10 canons and 72 rules. Compared to the counseling psychology profession, a review of rehabilitation literature indicates that multiculturalism as it relates to services to ethnic minorities has not been emphasized enough. Critical examinations of the American Counseling Association (ACA) Ethical Standards (1988) and the 1990 American Psychological Association (APA) Code show that the guidelines are nonspecific regarding services to culturally unique clients. The CPERC was based on the established APA and ACA codes. Expanding the explicit multicultural focus of the CPERC should influence the behavior of practicing rehabilitation counselors.

One of the acknowledgments was omitted from the original article; the proper acknowledgment is supplied. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record 1994-14953-001.) Describes the organization of the psychosocial aid and aftercare for survivors of the Bijlmermeer air disaster in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The research was based on an examination of relevant city documents, on interviews with about 40 city officials and representatives of aid agencies, and on a media archive. Findings show that the aid operation was complicated by the fact that the disaster struck a socially vulnerable multicultural community. However, by having a concentration of shelters the efficiency and manageability of the aid operation was improved. It is recommended that shelters be located close to survivors' former homes to avoid disruption of existing social networks and to assist survivors in regaining their sense of normality. In order to facilitate disaster recovery, assistance policies and practices should be tailored to the specific demographic, cultural, and psychological characteristics of the survivors.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Explored some aspects of the subjective experience of individualism and collectivism in Israel, a society that simultaneously emphasizes both worldviews. Ss were Arab and Jewish Israeli students (Study 1 n = 211, Study 2 n = 370, Study 3 n = 160, and Study 4 n = 280). As hypothesized, endorsing individualism as a worldview was related to focusing on private aspects of the self and conceptualizing the self in terms of distinctions between the self and others. Hypotheses suggesting a relationship between collectivism, centrality of social identities to self-definition, a focus on public aspects of the self, and heightened perception of intergroup conflict were also supported by the data. Unexpectedly, endorsement of an individualistic worldview was also related to these variables. Discussion focuses on the meld of individualism and collectivism that may occur in Israel.

PGPs are discussed as they pertain to both educational and hospital settings. In terms of legal intervention, parents are urged to be aware of their children's rights and to act immediately to initiate early intervention services according to their children's needs. With regard to multicultural intervention, it is noted that culturally appropriate models of intervention are based on the understanding that ways of talking are culturally-based and reflect deep underlying beliefs regarding the place of the child in society.

While the attitudes of the Germans were similar to those of the Anglo group, attitudes in other communities differed from the Anglo in several ways. There was less expectation that children with disabilities should behave like other children, be included in family outings, play with neighborhood children, or attend school. Their disabilities were more likely to be kept secret but less likely to be perceived as placing a strain on their parents' marriages. A son with a disability was considered particularly tragic. Findings are related to the individualistic or collectivist values of these communities, and to the work of rehabilitation practitioners working in multicultural settings.

Many beliefs about affirmative action were incorrect. Recruitment, training, and attention to applicant qualifications were favored, whereas discrimination, quotas, and preferential treatment were opposed. Opposition to potential AAP components was directly related to the weight given to demographic status. Responses varied depending on respondent gender and ethnicity. Conflict associated with affirmative action can be minimized by eliminating certain misperceptions about AAPs and by incorporating positively evaluated components.

The research was based on an examination of relevant city documents, on interviews with about 40 city officials and representatives of aid agencies, and on a media archive. Findings show that the aid operation was complicated by the fact that the disaster struck a socially vulnerable multicultural community. However, by having a concentration of shelters the efficiency and manageability of the aid operation was improved. It is recommended that shelters be located close to survivors' former homes to avoid disruption of existing social networks and to assist survivors in regaining their sense of normality. In order to facilitate disaster recovery, assistance policies and practices should be tailored to the specific demographic, cultural, and psychological characteristics of the survivors.

A case study of the methods of approximately 20 Black history teachers is presented. The rationale for the case study was the idea that multicultural education in American public schools may be afflicted with a kind of ""divided consciousness"" reflecting tensions between the racial, citizenship, and professional allegiances of teachers. Among the teachers studied, Black teachers provided the most explicitly counterhegemonic interpretation of the Black experience. This interpretation presented the Black experience mainly as a series of unrelated concrete events, facts, and persons held together by the historical isolation of Blacks, by the need of Blacks to be unified as a group, and by diffuse resentment against White domination. Thus, Black history did not realize its full empowering potential for the students.

A re-analysis of the data suggests that both views are mistaken: While multiculturalists appear to outnumber monoculturalists, many Australians are caught somewhere in between. Attitudes toward MLC correlate strongly with several things: views about assimilation, equal opportunity, government support for ethnic organizations and multicultural programs; the teaching of European as well as Asian languages; and the number, source, and kinds of migrants Australia should accept. Support for MLC is strongest among those who came of age after the offical birth of MLC, among those who support Labor or the Australian Democrats, and especially among those born in Europe or Asia. This suggests, that support for MLC is likely to grow.

After the summer program, Schaafsma interviewed all the teachers about their own version of events, their personal histories, and their work as educators. ""Eating on the Street"" presents all of these layered stories-by Schaafsma, his colleagues, and the students-to illustrate how talking across multiple perspectives can enrich the learning process and the community-building process outside the classroom as well. These accounts have strong implications for multicultural education today. They will interest teachers, educational experts, administrators, and researchers.

This volume describes research into these questions. Besides showing how best to evoke students' interest in reading, it calls for more interaction between students and teachers as to what books are particularly significant reading. ""Inspiring Literacy"" covers important issues in both children's and adolescent literature. It includes first-hand perspectives of teachers, librarians, editors, and authors. The articles review trends in children's book publishing and book selling; explore revolutionary changes in methods and materials used to teach reading; examine the status of multicultural children's literature; and suggest intriguing nonfiction and poetry books for youths. ""Inspiring Literacy"" is essential reading for elementary and secondary teachers, authors of children's and adolescent literature, students and faculty in book publishing courses, publishers, and librarians. This book may be used as an up-to-date state-of-the-art text for courses in children's and young adult literature.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) This book has been written primarily for middle-class Anglo-American psychologist service providers in order to provide necessary information for culturally competent assessment practice. Culturally competent assessment services stem from efforts to understand persons who differ in the realities that they have constructed to endow their lives with meaning and dignity and to offer respect for varied solutions to basic problems of living. This book deals with the acquisition of a knowledge base concerning application of existing assessment instruments and current research on new assessment instruments relevant to several major cultural groups in American society. Several training issues [are] reflected in this book: (a) minimal interest in training for cultural competence among most graduate students; (b) programs that do not encourage students to contextualize persons in their life settings; (c) haphazard applications of research findings in practice; and (d) professional identity that is characterized by an increasing separation between researchers and practitioners.

It focuses on the heterogeneous class, a school setting that has achieved some prominence in the recent scientific and professional literature. Upon entering a classroom we are no longer surprised to find extraordinary diversity of student attributes. Immediately apparent in many classes are the different hues of skin and other physical features of students. Observers of the educational scene employ a variety of terms to describe this kind of class. Some refer to it as a mixed-ability class emphasizing the diversity in student academic ability and achievement. Some speak of the multicultural or multiethnic class highlighting differences in the cultural or ethnic traditions and predispositions of children. Others use still different terminology, such as the heterogeneous class, as I have done in this book.

Addressing such issues as pluralism versus managerialism, quantitative versus qualitative methodologies, the purpose of higher education for knowledge production versus educating people for professions, clientism, and multicultural concerns, House traces how evaluation has evolved as a basis for determining where the field should go-and how.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) We hope this ""Sourcebook of Family Theories and Methods"" will help readers to reflect on the roots and context of family studies and to examine its evolving story and identity. This book uniquely emphasizes not only family theories but also research methods and the relationship between the two. We present the story of the development of family theory from its earliest seeds in religion and philosophy through the theory construction and methodology of the mid-twentieth century and of the newly emerging modes of the late twentieth century [a sociohistorical approach]. We also tried to include some personal or biographical information on the various theorists and methodologists. ""Applications"" follow each theory chapter and address a question frequently asked by students: How would this theory be applied in the ""real world?"" All authors were asked to weave into the theory chapters a discussion of how the theory takes into account differences in age, ethnicity, race, and gender. Our purpose is to emphasize the multicultural dimensions of both our subject matter (families) and our field (family studies).

Our multidimensional perspective is influenced by the need to recognize the demographic and cultural variations in families and to be visionary about the factors that will facilitate the functioning of children and families who are forging new family patterns. The family is viewed as a dynamic entity that can be expected to transform structurally and behaviorally over time. This book responds to a compelling need to integrate knowledge from research, practice, and policy sources and to devise innovative ways of thinking about family change and its implications for our society. The chapters move beyond the realm of the primary caretaker to consider the patterns of involvement of both parents in the life of the child and treat such parenting functions as caregiving, social interaction, and decision making as continua, not dichotomies.

The interaction of these timeless themes is what constitutes the work of counselors and how they do it. The treatment of each theme is interdisciplinary and integrative in order for the reader to gain better understanding of movements in our society and culture and the work of helping professionals. Relevant information is drawn from psychology, sociology, anthropology, education, economics, and other social sciences to form a comprehensive base of knowledge. This book emphasizes progress toward a better understanding of all clients whom counselors might encounter daily in a multicultural society. ""Counseling and Development in a Multicultural Society"" is intended as a comprehensive, broad-based text for those who are studying to become or who are human service counselors, adult counselors, rehabilitation and mental health counselors, counseling psychologists, and social workers.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) A major thesis of this book is that culturally sensitive counselors can establish the necessary and sufficient conditions of a helping relationship with many clients who come from cultural backgrounds different from their own. The purposes of this edition remain the same as those of the earlier editions. First, the book is intended to sensitize counselors to the life experiences and within-group differences of four racial/ethnic minority groups. A second major purpose is to examine how counseling has failed to meet the mental health needs of racial/ethnic minorities in the past. A third purpose is to suggest new directions for the counseling profession when serving racial/ethnic minority in the future. The current edition can be used in conjunction with a variety of courses related to counseling and mental health service. The book has served as both a primary text and as supplemental reading for such courses as cross-cultural counseling, multicultural counseling, diversity issues in mental health, counseling techniques, theories of counseling, community psychology, and mental health outreach.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Constructing environmental and health policies appropriate across diverse communities is challenging. Group differences in the circumstances of exposure and in responses to environmental risk are common. Consequences of this variability may become more apparent given recent calls for more deregulation and an increased use of participatory strategies to manage environmental risks. Approaches requiring active public participation will be successful only if diverse groups can be engaged. Psychological studies of individual differences in risk behaviors can provide policymakers with insights about why responses vary in risk situations and how effective certain participatory strategies may be across a multicultural society. Responses of Mexican immigrant farmworkers to pesticide risk illustrate how the broader context of exposure can contribute to variability among communities in risk adaptation and affect the implementation of innovative policies.

Results indicate that the CL of minority members was less than that of majority members, supporting findings by C. Kirchmeyer and A. Cohen (see record 1992-42922-001). Low CC, low scores on masculinity, and high scores on femininity were associated with minority status and with low contribution.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) In this book we attempt to involve readers in learning to deal with the professional and ethical issues that most affect the actual practice of counseling and related helping professions. To this end we raise the following questions: How do the therapist's values and life experiences affect the therapeutic process? What are the rights and responsibilities of both the client and the helper? As professionals, how can we determine our level of competence? How can we provide quality services for culturally diverse populations? What are some major ethical issues facing practitioners in marital and family therapy? in group work? in community agencies? in private practice? Our goal is both to provide a body of information and to teach readers a process of dealing with the basic issues they will face throughout their careers. For most of the issues we raise, we present a number of viewpoints to stimulate discussion and reflection. We also present our views, when appropriate, to challenge readers to formulate their own positions. To assist in this process, we cite the ethical codes of various professional organizations, which offer some guidance for practice. These guidelines leave many questions unanswered, however. We believe that students and professionals alike must ultimately struggle with the issues of responsible practice, deciding how accepted ethical standards apply in the specific cases they encounter. ""Issues and Ethics in the Helping Professions"" is written for both graduate and undergraduate students in the helping professions. It is suitable for courses involving human-services delivery, including counseling and social work. . . . Because the issues we discuss are likely to be encountered throughout one's professional career, we have tried to use language and concepts that will be meaningful both to students doing their fieldwork and to professionals interested in improving their skills through continuing-education seminars or independent reading.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) The mission of the conference in Mexico City in June 1990 was to bring together counselors and other human development specialists, including theorists and researchers, to examine the challenges posed by the increasingly diverse Spanish-speaking populations located throughout the Americas. An attempt was made to clarify the roles of helping professionals as mediators and advocates for persons of Latino/Hispanic origin, with particular attention to ethnic/cultural identification and within-group differences. An effort also was made to consider the contribution that indigenous practices make to counseling in Latin America and the social and economic consequences of majority-minority relations in both Latin American and North American cultures. This conference promoted and facilitated important dialogue about the broad issues of community, diversity, communication, and spiritual concerns that affect Latino/Hispanic groups. Indeed, numerous presentations and discussions focused on each of these broad topics; thus, this monograph is organized around these four areas of emphasis.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) This text, written for college juniors and seniors enrolled in courses dealing with culture's impact on human behavior, was written with two very basic assumptions. The first is that people, all over the world, will continue to increase their contact with members of diverse cultures. The second is that research in cross-cultural studies can provide very helpful guidelines for people as they interact in a fast-changing world marked by increasing intercultural contact. Given progress in cross-cultural and intercultural studies, texts can be written and courses offered that can stimulate students to understand better their own culture, the cultures of others, and how culture influences human behavior. Often, such a course will be offered out of a psychology department and will have the title ""Cross-Cultural Psychology,"" and this text was written with this course in mind. Given the interest of many professors in cross-cultural and intercultural studies, however, this text may also prove useful in courses such as intercultural communication, multicultural education, international human resources development, and international management. Given that many professors feel that students should be introduced to issues of cultural diversity as soon as possible, the text may also prove useful for students taking a first course in the study of human behavior.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Diversity and complexity in feminist therapy by Laura Brown and Maria P. P. Root (1990). This is an exciting and compelling book, challenging to both feminists and clinicians who work with women. It focuses on appreciating, understanding, and building on the differences among women. While it describes and defines the principles of feminist therapy theory, it also incorporates those principles into the very way the book is written-that is, by authors who themselves come from a variety of ethnic heritages and cultural backgrounds and who discuss the impact of oppression and victimization through sexism, racism, and classism, white privilege, and homophobia on the diversity and complexity of women's lives. The goal of this book is to offer proactive perspectives on the development of antiracist and multicultural theories so that feminist therapy theory is ""relevant to all women of color, non-North American women, and so on"" (p. 18). The message conveyed throughout this book is that we must ""guard against imposing our own personal contexts, whatever they may be, upon the meaning and realities of women different from ourselves"" in our theories and in our therapies (p. 13). The goal is not only met overall in this book, but is consistently addressed within each of its chapters.

The major purpose of the book is to describe the multicultural model of psychotherapy and counseling that Ramirez believes to be more appropriate for and effective with people who for any reason fall into his broad category of different, as defined above. The principal objective inherent in this model is to help people who feel different and alienated to accept and understand their uniqueness and in so doing to avert the potential onset of mental health problems. Complimenting this objective, the model also demonstrates ways to develop cultural (values) and coping (cognitive styles) flexibility, a cognitive skill that is necessary for the attainment of a multicultural orientation to life, an orientation that Ramirez believes to be of the utmost importance vis-a- vis the changing demographics in this country.

Reviews the book, Ethnic Ethics: The Restructuring of Moral Theory by Anthony J. Cortese (see record 1990-97938-000). In this book, the author focuses on ethnic, racial, social class, and gender differences in morality and moral judgment within the United States. Cortese presents what is essentially a sociological analysis of moral development and a sociocultural critique of Kohlberg's theoretical and empirical work. In contrast to the Kohlbergian view that morality is autonomously constructed by rational moral agents, Cortese argues that morality is socially and culturally constructed, such that ""morality is to be found in the structure of society, not in the structure of human cognition."" Although Cortese has sketched the outlines of an important and timely sociological critique and reconceptualization of the study of moral development, his project falls short in the end because he is unable to break away from the bounds of the cognitive-developmental paradigm, the paradigm he claims to be challenging. Clearly the time is ripe for an exploration of moral development that takes seriously differences in ethnicity, race, social class, and gender within the context of our own multicultural American society.

Reviews the book, Social Support: An Interactional View edited by Barbara R. Sarason, Irwin G. Sarason, and Gregory R. Pierce (see record 1990-97699-000). In this book, social support is examined from a person--environment interactional perspective, focusing on specific components of interpersonal transactions that may explain the connection between support and well-being. The volume pays particular attention to both support provision and receipt and explores the beneficial as well as the detrimental consequences of support exchange. The major theme of the book is that social support is an interactional process. For the most part, this is limited to a dyadic interaction between a provider and a recipient. Although a number of chapters suggest the importance of understanding support in context, only a few examine support processes within the broader context of our social institutions (e.g., work, family, and community) or with a multicultural or life span developmental framework.

The gifted adolescent is in sore need of attention in the educational literature, this book addresses that need. The editors of this volume chose a broad perspective that includes issues of real concern to real adolescents. The emphasis is consistently on the special needs of the adolescent as she or he tries to traverse the chasm from childhood to adulthood with both the singular advantage and the not-so-subtle burden of being gifted. This book's greatest strength lies in its discussion of the psychosocial influences on gifted adolescents. Unfortunately the literature is neither complete nor definitive, and it continues to raise more questions than it answers. The strong point of this book is that the questions are clear.

Ponterotto and Casas demonstrate that racial and ethnic differences are too complicated to be fairly captured in a two-sided polarization. The authors address this urgently important task in several ways. The carefully defined, data-based approaches to problems of research with racial and ethnic minority groups are urgently important for a constructive approach to the problems of our multicultural society.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) Dr. Beth Harry explores the quadruple disadvantage faced by parents from low-income, cultural minority backgrounds whose children have been designated ""handicapped,"" and who do not speak the language of the school their children attend. Her sensitive, in-depth ethnographic portrait of 12 Puerto Rican American families serves to illustrate how the present structure of the special education system disempowers parents, excluding them from the decision-making processes that initially categorize their children as ""handicapped,"" and can eventually place them at a permanent educational disadvantage. The author's insight into the immense challenge faced by schools-""the education system simply has not been geared to understand, respect, and address the needs of such tremendous heterogeneity""-as well as her perception of the resulting ""striking pattern of cross-cultural dissonance"" applies not only to Spanish-speaking families but to all culturally different families who must negotiate their way within the special education system. This should be required reading for graduate students of special education, multicultural education, bilingual education, and the sociology of education. It will appeal to all parents and advocates of minority children in special education classes.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) research on Differential Item Functioning (DIF) deals with 2 related questions / the 1st issue is whether some items in a given psychological test are relatively difficult for some cultural group in comparison with another cultural group / the 2nd issue is why such items are relatively difficult for a particular group / a plausible explanation for DIF is that the item measures a trait different from that measured by the test as a whole (the target construct), and one of the studied groups has a lower standing with respect to this additional trait / consequently, exploring the causes for the relative difficulty of items could be seen as finding the biasing traits / studies of DIF can be viewed as a special case of the research into the dimensionality of a test: the attention is focused on that kind of test multidimensionality, which causes 1 or more items to be relatively difficult for a particular group
(from the introduction) explains how the construct of language proficiency in multilingual settings may be influenced by the ethnic background of the learner / proposes several statistical detection methods [CITO secondary education placement test] to sample data in order to identify specific items which probably function differentially in the population / by means of latent trait analysis he demonstrates how ethnic bias in language proficiency assessment can be overcome (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",ethnic background & differential item functioning in language proficiency assessment in multicultural settings,"*Language Proficiency

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examines the subjective factors that influence the decision-making process from labeling an incident as possible abuse or neglect through the disposition stage. Multicultural issues that affect each stage of the process are discussed. Areas of disparate treatment of minorities are considered. Disparate treatment stems from biased and unequal application of the laws in some cases, or when standards are applied and interventions made that are insensitive to the cultural context of the family. Potential consequences of failing to consider culture in applying child protection laws are biased reporting, errors in assessing perceived risk, ineffective interventions, and increased out-of-home placements. The need for a culturally sensitive approach to assessment and intervention is emphasized.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) The general college student body has evolved from a homogeneous, predominantly white population to one that is culturally, racially, and ethnically diverse. The findings of current research on achievement and retention of minority students are discouraging. Fewer minorities attend college, success rates of those in college have not improved, and dreams of achieving educational equity remain unfulfilled. This volume of ""New Directions for Student Services"" moves forward from a descriptive perspective of what is happening on college campuses. It describes an approach to working with students that involves ""cultural brokering,"" which enjoins us to learn to think contextually, span boundaries, ensure optimum performance, and take action. The cultural broker model is suggested for use with all students on today's campuses. The model presents a vision of practice that can respond to the diversity of the 1990s and beyond. This reflexive approach is defined as deliberate and thoughtful choices of action based on knowledge of cultural differences, expansion of personal experience to others' communities, education from a variety of perspectives, and advocacy for broadening opportunities. For college administrators and student affairs professionals, the perspectives and suggestions within this volume provide valuable insights about the creation and maintenance of multicultural campuses.

Edited Book",,"(from the introduction) The first section, ""Issues and Application,"" deals primarily with therapeutic concerns. The various contributions, however, go beyond traditional therapeutic issues and also address important questions of assessment, as well as treatment, in certain focused settings. Issues that relate to a number of different types of clients and situations are covered. The second section addresses ""Practice Management"" and related professional development issues. This section is included because of the increasing number of clinicians who work independently and require a source of information on practice management and professional development. The assessment instruments [reviewed in section III] are primarily informal and designed to assist the clinician in collecting information about clients. Our goal is to publish screening instruments and forms that aid in the organization of data, rather than the making of formal inferences. The fourth section on ""Community interventions"" reflects our view that mental health practitioners have much to offer the community beyond traditional clinical services. The fifth section on ""Selected Topics"" includes a variety of contributions that do not fit neatly into one of the other sections. Topics in Volume 11 range from a review of nonsexual dual relationships to discussions on practicing ethically with managed care patients and managing patients with chronic pain.

In the culture-specific approach, the authors start with the culture and its people and search out natural helping styles.

This preliminary study applies anthropological constructs and the methods of microtraining seeking to discover a more culturally sensitive approach to conceptualization of counseling theory, training in counseling skills and knowledge, and in the use of evaluative research techniques.

In contrast, the operational model of self-concept, which defines self-descriptive behavior, permits identification of styles, strengths, and weaknesses in the areas of self-concept.

It assumes that literature in English should be drawn from different cultures and countries in order to foster in readers self-knowledge and awareness of cultural diversity. Practically oriented, it recommends and discusses the classroom use of novels, poems and plays written in the Indian subcontinent, South Africa, the Caribbean, the USA and other countries.

Authored Book",,"(from the jacket) ""Group Counseling and Psychotherapy with Adolescents"" provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory and practice of group counseling and psychotherapy with adolescents. This reliable source offers an overview of group dynamic theory and the essentials for adolescent group work in a variety of locations, including schools, clinics, family violence and substance abuse programs, criminal justice counseling centers, youth employment programs, and recreational settings. The authors emphasize the need for those who work with adolescents to understand the many youth subcultures and to relate to the specific interests of each teenager. They also stress the importance of treating teens within their normal environments whenever possible in order to avoid the resistance commonly encountered in clinical settings. MacLennan and Dies provide detailed explanations of new approaches to group treatment, describing the development and management of groups from beginning to end and presenting prevention and treatment alternatives suited to four different levels of group counseling and therapy. They examine how adolescents today are affected by recent increases in drug and alcohol abuse, less stable family structures, teenage sexuality, pregnancy, and AIDS. They explain new theories on female psychological development and discuss the role of multicultural issues in group work. Straightforward and refreshingly free of jargon, this newest edition of ""Group Counseling and Psychotherapy with Adolescents"" is essential for professionals and volunteers who work with teenagers to help them develop healthy, responsible, and successful lives.

It will help the reader identify characteristics of cultures, make comparisons between the dominant culture and the culturally different groups, make comparisons among culturally different groups, and use that information to develop strategies or interventions for students or clients. The book is designed to help make readers aware of their own ethnocentrism and to increase their awareness of the role culture plays in determining the ways people think, feel, and act. This book is intended for undergraduate or graduate courses in multicultural education or counseling. It can be used as a supplement to a text for a course in which the instructor wants students to have specific information on a number of cultural groups.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) Three themes shape the book's presentation of adult development. First, the book takes a life-span orientation. I discuss physical, psychological, and social changes that take place in middle and later adulthood as long-term consequences of the choices and circumstances surrounding earlier periods of the life cycle, and I consider events occurring in early adulthood with respect to their eventual impact later in development. A second theme is the importance of examining adult development as a multicultural phenomenon. Throughout the book, I point out ways in which race, gender, social class, and culture moderate developmental processes and outcomes. The most obvious reflections of this theme are the Diversity in Adulthood boxes appearing in each chapter, in which a topic addressed in the chapter is examined from a multicultural perspective. In addition, virtually all chapters include explicit attention to multicultural issues. A third, more general, theme is encouragement for students to think critically about the material. The book provides students with sufficient grounding in research methodology, measurement issues, and statistical approaches to critically consider research findings. And the Open Questions boxes in each chapter introduce a controversial issue related to topics raised in the chapter and prompt students to evaluate contrasting arguments regarding that issue. Throughout the book, I present an overview of both classic and contemporary research and theory. . . . I discuss all research-both classic and contemporary-with an eye toward showing the student both the significance of the work and ways in which researchers' decisions concerning sampling, measurement, and analysis can affect the outcome of research.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) Part I addresses conceptual issues, in which the key question is 'whither indigenous psychology?' Papers in this section form a collage of interests in and concerns for indigenous psychology, a trend clearly seen in the conference. Some are position papers about indigenous psychology; others realize indigenous psychology in research; and still another examines its impact on psychological research. Whether one agrees with or criticizes indigenization of psychology as an approach, it appears that cross-cultural psychology, and possibly psychology at large, has to come to terms with the trend. Parts II through IV collect papers in three general areas of 'social and organizational psychology,' 'cognitive processes,' and 'values, self, and personality.' Clearly active research is being conducted around the world in these traditionally strong areas of cross-cultural psychology. Three discernible trends are (1) an emphasis on communication processes, (2) a continuing research program on values, and (3) an emergence of interests in self processes. The concepts of individualism and collectivism, however, continue to provide underlying themes for many of the papers. Parts V and VI are devoted to more specific areas of cross-cultural research: 'culture and health' and 'culture and schooling.'

Full of practical ideas, methods, and examples, ""Metaframeworks"" offers a wealth of guidelines for applying innovative strategies to a wide range of clinical problems and populations. In addition, this book provides an orientation to thinking about human systems at many levels, revealing a set of concepts with which to analyze the complexity of family life. By acknowledging and expanding upon the fundamental understandings of various family therapy approaches, the authors enable all practicing clinicians to improve the flexibility and comprehensiveness of their approaches-without having to abandon their training. Furthermore, the authors look beyond the boundaries of traditional family systems approaches, seeking to help therapists better understand the individual's internal thought processes. And they examine the influence of the social context on families, discussing in depth such factors as culture and gender.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) In thinking about this text, we first had to grapple with the problem that each mental health profession seems to have developed its own supervision literature. . . . Therefore, we undertook to review what we considered to be the best supervision literature from several disciplines. Our intent was for this book to reflect the fields of counseling, psychology, social work, and marriage and family therapy. Because our goal is to help promote supervision in general, we have blended these fields of literature. With the exception of live supervision, which typically is associated with marriage and family therapy, we have tended not to identify particular resources as a ""contribution from psychology"" or a ""contribution from social work."" Rather, this textbook integrates the knowledge that has been produced by these different disciplines and leads the reader through conceptual and practical topics that are of interest to all clinical supervisors regardless of their particular professional lens. This book does not defend any one approach to studying or practicing clinical supervision; instead it attempts to present a comprehensive view of the field and the issues that are central to supervision practice.

Institutional racism may cause misdiagnosis; for example, it is argued that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) contains inherent assumptions that reflect a Western bias. Clinicians must examine their own prejudices so that assessment procedures can better reflect the reality of their clients' experience.

An alternative understanding of the term cross-cultural counseling sees it not so much as a distinct counseling method, but as a kind of psychosocial hermeneutic. As such, the term refers to the ongoing need of professionals to realign themselves and their helping methods, which are institutionalized and sanctioned by the pervasive (dominant) culture, so as not to exclude those people who relate to other (marginalized) cultural contexts. The article reviews current treatment trends and directions in the literature, discusses 3 fundamental conversions that are necessary for the pastoral counselor to do cross-cultural counseling, and presents a case illustration involving a multicultural pastoral counseling intervention.

There are several unique factors in this book such as its emphasis on group counseling in a multicultural context that delineates each perspective while considering the culture of the individual. This is a welcome new addition for most books of this type. Second, the organization of the book and of each chapter provides a basis for the orderly progression of concepts. By presenting each theory within a guiding framework, the reader can compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

This book successfully expands the scope of the discussion beyond minority groups. It illustrates the widespread effects of racial, ethnic, and power differences on self-concept and social behavior in a multicultural society. This book addresses what individuals incorporate into their personal identities about race, ethnicity, and culture. It illuminates how these internalized constructs of self influence feelings, attitudes, and behaviors within and across cultural groups. The most unique contribution of the book is the chapter on understanding power. The book is indeed aimed at clinicians who wish to be more sensitive to the dynamics of race and ethnicity in clinical practice.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) Traditionally, issues of early social development have been the concern of preschool teachers and researchers in the fields of psychology and education. The wealth of knowledge and experience that has been accumulated in these domains is now surfacing as educators and politicians expand their search for solutions to America's deepening educational crisis. ""Making Friends in School: Promoting Peer Relationships in Early Childhood"" accomplishes the formidable task of not only synthesizing research efforts from a range of disciplines but also showing their direct application to the education of children in preschool and elementary classrooms. The volume opens with a definitive statement on the importance of early childhood friendships that is reaffirmed in the following three chapters, which examine developmental trends, group dynamics, and individual differences in the social arena. Patricia Ramsey's examination of the research in these areas is continually brought back to the classroom through the presentation and analysis of a range of interpersonal scenarios that will be familiar to any classroom teacher. The synthesis of these areas results in an unusually comprehensive picture of the child's world-one further complemented by the author's examination of interpersonal relationships in a multicultural context. The second part of the book focuses directly on practical applications that can be implemented on the basis of an understanding of social and individual behavior in early childhood. All aspects of the classroom-from the organization of the materials and structures within it to the dynamics that characterize it-are meticulously examined with the goal of helping the teacher become a more effective educator and more adept at solving social problems. A uniquely successful integration of theory and practice, this book will be an excellent supplemental text in undergraduate and graduate courses in early childhood and elementary education, developmental psychology, and human development, as well as an engaging and thought-provoking resource for in-service early childhood professionals.

This approach enables researchers to examine the interplay of maturational and environmental influences on newborns and infants, and provides a broader understanding of the variability of newborn and infant behavior. The goals of the series are: to assemble reports of original empirical research on infancy from different cultural and disciplinary perspectives; to examine the relationship between culture and infant development by examining different neonatal environments and child rearing practices; to explore various research methods and methdological techniques which permit comparisons of findings across culture; to document and examine the use of the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale as a research tool in different cultural settings; and to discuss the clinical implications of research examining infancy and the development of parent-child relations in different cultural settings. Topics discussed in this volume include: cultural mediation between newborn behavior and later development; influence of infant irritability on the development of the mother-infant relationship in the first 6 months of life; facilitating early motor development; mother-infant interaction; newborn behavior and development; and fetal nutrition.

The focus of the book is on cultural experiences related to racial or ethnic factors in counseling. It deals with the counseling and human development needs of selected groups of people, commonly referred to as racial or ethnic minorities in American society. Each chapter includes a review of the cultural dynamics of these selected groups and their role in shaping mental health, as well as the social challenges that affect development. The contributors introduce and explore strategies or techniques for addressing these challenges. These strategies and techniques are derived from both the professional and personal experiences of the contributors, who are scholars from the specific cultural group in question, or have an intimate working knowledge of a particular group.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) ""Current Perspectives on School Culture"" brings together a wide range of perspectives to indicate the complexity of how schools operate and how complex it is to alter their current function. My intention is to provide practitioners and graduate students with theories, ideas and reflections on life in school that will help them to look at the complex organization of their school, and to see beneath the glaze of routine and regularity, as a necessary step toward planning and implementing school improvement and change. Diverse approaches help the reader to grasp the dynamics, problems and strengths of school and university cultures. Regularities and rules, symbols and discourse, myth and meanings are used to interpret a world bounded by a sense of place called school. In the view presented here, social structure and culture are intertwined. Cultural differences are seen as lines tracing status, power, and political interest within and across institutional boundaries (Erickson, 1987). Significant attention will be given to the personal, to the clash of values and expectations that erupt among professional and personal traditions and histories, between established subgroups and ""newcomers,"" the unempowered majority. . . . Changing school cultures to meet the needs of community, staff and students is the challenge of the decade. Several of the authors propose alternatives for staff development and teacher education that offer hopeful new directions. This approach to the study of schools is not neat or methodical. It does not propose logical constructs. But from its thrust toward validating experiences, perceptions and attitudes, the social realities and aspirations of students, teachers and parents who believe in public education can be shared, studied, changed and celebrated.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) ""Understanding the Gifted Adolescent: Educational, Developmental, and Multicultural Issues"" is a seminal volume whose purpose is to fill a void in the literature that until now has focused exclusively on younger gifted children. It deals not only with the educational but also the psychological issues that impact gifted learners as they make the arduous transition from children to adulthood. Topics covered include career decision making, spiritual and moral development, sexuality, and problems such as eating, anxiety, and stress disorders that may result from psychosocial maladjustment and the often self-imposed pressure of perfectionism. Three chapters are devoted to the doubly difficult task of the minority student, who must come to terms with these developmental issues while battling racist attitudes that consistently work to undermine self-esteem and cultural pride. This volume emphasizes that teachers, counselors, and parents play a key role in helping gifted adolescents solidify their personal beliefs and objectives. It makes clear that the internal conflicts that characterize adolescence need not keep gifted students from realizing their potential. Rather, from these conflicts, leadership skills and a solid sense of individuality can be born. This text will be a valuable resource for preservice and inservice teachers, counselors, program administrators, and district coordinators of gifted programs.

It enables clinicians to be sensitive to cultural and individual diversity and to encourage clients to develop diverse coping skills. A variety of case histories is presented, illustrating how the values-cognitive styles model can be applied to people of different racial and/or ethnic groups as they cope with different problems of adjustment. In addition, recommendations are made for changes in therapy-counseling training programs and in delivery of mental health services, to encourage development of multicultural orientations to life in society.

The text is appropriate for all undergraduates taking a first course in child development or child and adolescent development, regardless of the department in which the course is taught. As in the preceding edition, the text consists of sixteen chapters divided into six parts. Part One, ""Studying Development,"" introduces students to the field of developmental psychology and describes the theories and methods that guide our understanding of child and adolescent development. Part Two, ""Beginnings,"" examines the role genetics plays in shaping whom a child becomes and traces the events of the very earliest period of development: from conception through birth. Each of the remaining four parts concentrates on a specific age-range of child development-the first two years, the preschool years, the middle years, and adolescence-and is composed of a trio of chapters on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development.

""Human"" stress response, this is the first indication of the microlevel slant of this book.

Women, although more than half of the population, are introduced as a ""special topic"" which incorporates the book's only female guest author. In spite of the best intentions and great expertise and experience of the author, the ""human stress response"" is perceived as a pathological process, existing in a microcosm of specific responses with proscribed interventions, rather than the logical consequence of a multicultural world in transition.

Both groups responded to an attitudinal questionnaire. The experimental group also engaged in a short interaction, while the control group remained silent. Both groups again then responded to the questionnaire. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) of responses tabulated from questionnaire responses revealed that the factor identified as compatibility was maintained, while attraction was significantly increased. It was concluded that after early interactions, strangers were more likely to perceive themselves as somewhat attractive to one another; their impressions of mutual compatibility, however, did not change noticeably.

Six investigative approaches are discussed: overseasmanship, subjective culture and isomorphic attribution, multicultural, social behaviorism and cultural learning, typological, and intercultural communications. Major components of ICC are summarized, and propositions about ICC delineated. The propositions deal with individual characteristics related to self-concept, self-disclosure, self- monitoring, social relaxation, message skills, behavioral flexibility, interaction management ability, interaction involvement, social skills, psychological adaptation ability, and cultural awareness. Research challenges discussed include conflict over competence as an inherent or learned ability, confusion between effectiveness and competence, and what should be measured for ICC and how it should be assessed.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) School psychology in North America is at a crossroads, with little consensus regarding the role of its practitioners. The traditional view of the school psychologist is that of a technocrat whose main responsibility is the provision of mental testing services. However, a more encompassing perception is that of the psychologist as educational problem solver: a consultant who is able to draw on a wide body of knowledge for the benefit of students, parents, and educators. There has been increasing advocacy in the profession for the expanded use of consultation, but little advice on how to move toward this goal while at the same time meeting educators' legitimate need for traditional psychological assessment. The aim of this book is to fill that gap, by presenting an overall model for service delivery that incorporates both areas of activity. It is intended to provide practical help to those school psychologists who wish to free themselves from the narrow constraints of testing, to assist them in identifying the skills and tools they need for fostering a consultative approach, and to provide them with useful information for implementation.

Authored Book",,"(from the jacket) Like its predecessor-which awakened the therapeutic community to the varying assumptions, needs, and biases of culturally different clients-this updated and revised ""Second Edition"" opens new doors and lays the groundwork for exciting new directions. While the overall approach has remained the same, there is heightened emphasis on the damaging effects of political and racial biases inherent in the mental health field and on the need for developing culture-specific communication/helping styles for culturally different clients. Also highlighted are the key issues of ethnic and racial identity formation and culturally specific concepts of the family and their relationship to counseling. ""Counseling the Culturally Different"" moves from the theoretical to the practical in three sections covering: Issues and Concepts-provides a conceptual framework with which to view the complex interplay of values, expectations, and social and political forces in the counselor-client relationship and the practice of cross-cultural counseling in public schools, mental health agencies, industries, and correctional institutions. Counseling Specific Populations-guidelines and detailed methods for counseling specific minority groups (including African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian Americans). Critical Incidents-a series of case vignettes portraying typical issues and dilemmas. Combining a sound conceptual framework for multicultural counseling with proven therapeutic methods for specific groups, ""Counseling the Culturally Different, Second Edition"" prepares students, like no other text in the field, for the rigors of counseling in the ""real world."" At the same time, as a source of enlightenment and guidance for professionals, it has been proven to make a difference in clients' lives.

Authored Book",,"(from the publicity materials) Examining the issues of treatment, organizational planning, and research, this multidimensional study offers a critique of both the theoretical and programmatic aspects of providing mental health services to traditionally underserved populations. Focusing on minority groups, the book uses the case of Hispanics to illustrate the largely unaddressed need for services that are relevant to social groups with diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Vega and Murphy maintain that the present service system is socially insensitive, that mental health services in the United States were never designed to serve a multicultural population, and that, in general, those who dominate the current mental health ""system"" from administrator-clinicians to bureaucrats and politicians do not know how to direct their services to minority groups. Calling for fundamental reconceptualization and change, the book argues for community-based planning and intervention as an enlightened and necessary alternative, and provides a detailed description of such a program in terms of both philosophy and method.

Moreover, the authors go beyond merely discussing these issues and suggest remedies in several areas related to improving the academic achievement of these students. The volume presents a fresh dialogue, with new ideas, models, and theories, from compassionate, knowledgeable scholars who tackle critical topics and present clear, useful analyses and recommendations geared toward the formulation and implementation of practices and policies designed to improve the academic achievement of African-American students. This volume will be valuable in a variety of classroom and organizational settings. It will be useful in the growing number of college courses focusing on urban schools where nearly one half of the students are African-American. Courses in teacher preparation can use the volume in their discussions on academic achievement. Black studies departments can use the book as a text when considering African-American education. National, state, and local organizations that focus partially or solely on the education of African-Americans will also find this text of value.

In that 1982 book, John E. Williams and Deborah L. Best explained how they tested adults and children in more than 30 nations by using multiple translations of the Adjective Check List. In the present volume, Williams and Best give us an extension of their research with the Adjective Check List. The main topics in this book are gender roles and perception of self, examined again from a multicultural perspective. The methodology was similar to that used in the earlier study, but this time they added the Sex-Role Ideology Scale. Both methods were employed in 14 countries using samples of university students. The present volume is clearly a sequel to Volume 6 as well as an extension and elaboration of methodology and theoretical viewpoints that the authors thoughtfully employed to help explain the results.

Henderson gives us observations from his rich professional and intellectual life which germinated his earlier volumes: ""The Wisdom of the Serpent"" (with Maud Oakes), ""Thresholds of Initiation"" and ""Cultural Attitudes in Psychological Perspective."" In the present volume, we find his first formulations of these theories, as well as issues related to these centers of his thinking and his work. These papers are derived from his clinical practice and his cross-disciplinary investigations of chosen aspects of culture. His long interest in anthropology appears in papers on the American Indian, religious questions in the East and the West, and problems which develop out of our own multi-cultural society. His personal feeling for the arts and literature have produced papers on Goethe and Wilder. His selected film reviews document his belief that films express issues current in the collective unconscious of the culture of our own times. Most of all, from these papers we get the perspective of a man who has led a long and reflective life as an observer of the inner life of twentieth-century man, and who has been an active participant in his own culture and his own times.

When the term reflection is heard by different people, it is understood in many different ways. These five chapters offer a sample of multiple understandings of reflection with no attempt to promote one over another. Chapters 6 through 10 present examples of programs designed to encourage reflective practice. This section of the book includes teacher educators' accounts of the successes and problems inherent in the practical implementation of the abstract concept of ""reflection."" These chapters further elaborate upon the complexity introduced in the first five chapters by highlighting the gaps between rhetoric and practice. The final chapter discusses the importance of continual inquiry into our own practices as teacher educators in the context of reflection.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) Applied to schools, affect refers to those facets of education that have to do with personal-social development. According to Beane, the concept has been distorted recently with the increased emphasis on excellence and academic achievement. He argues that a new kind of affect has emerged in schools, having more to do with competition and conformity than with democracy, dignity, and diversity. The author traces the history of programs and theories of self-esteem, values education, character education, and other ""affective"" topics, critically analyzing their present form. To resolve the confusion and contradictions surrounding these issues in schools, a proposal is made to restructure the curriculum around the themes of political democracy, human dignity, and cultural diversity. Examples of curricular and institutional practices are presented, along with suggestions for a practical discourse at the local level, which will enable teachers to bring these themes to life in the classroom. ""Affect in the Curriculum"" outlines important ways in which the subjects of morals, values, and citizenship can be re-introduced to students, detailing how this emphasis may contribute to a more humane future. This controversial book extends earlier work on affect beyond psychology and into sociology and philosophy, raising the difficult question of what, humanly speaking, the schools ought to stand for and work toward. Research practitioners and researchers in curriculum theory, particularly the affective area, will find this book especially interesting. In addition, the text will be helpful to upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in theoretically oriented curriculum methods courses, and those in the philosophy, psychology, and sociology of education.

Cognitive empathy, defined as cultural role taking, enables the counselor to cognitively understand and work within the cultural framework of the client. Cultural role taking is recommended for use with White counselors and clients of color. Future researchers are advised of the qualitative and quantitative empirical work yet to be done in this area.

It sets up a creative tension between respecting differences and not accepting unfair beliefs and acts. It asks teachers and children to confront troublesome issues rather than covering them up. An anti-bias perspective is integral to all aspects of daily classroom life. Using its principles and methodology, teachers (and parents) must recreate anti-bias curriculum in their setting in relation to specific groups of children and families. Therefore, developmental information about children, illustrated by their comments, questions, and behavior, supplements suggested activities so that the teacher can understand ""why"" as well as the ""what"" and the ""how"" of activities.

With few exceptions, the concept of shame is simply not in our clinical or, for that matter, academic vocabulary. This book attempts to draw attention to an area that has been grossly neglected. The majority of chapters have a psychoanalytic focus. While there is some variability in the quality of the chapters, they do provide the reader with a very interesting and quite extensive review of the concept of shame. However, the book is unsatisfying in some aspects because of omissions that limit its value. Mention has already been made of the absence of writings from a multicultural prospective. It is a real shame that this is missing. That, however, is not the only omission in the book. The area of shame as related to gender is totally absent. It is hard to conceive of a topic such as this that does not have important gender connections.

Reviews the book, Health and Cross-Cultural Psychology: Toward Applications edited by Pierre R. Dasen, John W. Berry, and Norman Sartorius (see record 1988-97726-000). This book is one of the first attempts to identify practical and applied psychological perspectives of healthy human development in a variety of cultural settings. It is not a cookbook of recipes, but it does recognize the importance of complexity in multicultural situations and provides tools for those seeking healthy human development. The book relies on familiar concepts, which are applied to both culture-specific and culture-general examples. By covering such a broad range of topics, the book provides an excellent introduction to the topic of healthy human development but, in its broad coverage, serves only as a beginning. This book is a successful starting point in the search for a new perspective in psychological health and in the anchoring of that perspective in practical and applied settings. The book is a sampling of topics and, to that extent, is incomplete.

Parker (see record 1988-97181-000); and A Handbook for Developing Multicultural Awareness by Paul Pedersen (see record 1988-97696-000). Although both authors clearly espouse the significance of multicultural training, they differ on the definition of multiculturalism. Pedersen states that culture is comprised of more than ethnographic variables, demographic, status, and affiliation variables are also included. Parker, on the other hand, focuses on race and ethnicity, which implies that these variables are central aspects of culture. These definitions influence each author's approach to multicultural counseling. The audiences for Parker and Pedersen are providers and trainers, with Parker speaking more directly to providers and Pedersen highlighting training programs. As opposed to Pedersen, Parker focuses the bulk of his text on raising the personal and cultural awareness of his audience. Pedersen's and Parker's texts provide much needed materials that will facilitate the accomplishment of such a task.

It is an exciting addition to the educational scene. The book is unusual because it deals with both the results and methods of educational research. The reader is addressed directly, and issues, which are illustrated from the author's own research, are set in their educational and historical contexts. In each case, the findings and the decision-making that led to their disclosure are presented. Thus, research is brought alive and the reader is provided with a framework within which to analyse current and future research. Above all, ""Understanding Research in Early Education"" dispels the research 'mystique,' and gives clear reasons why it is necessary to base classroom practice on sound research. It is a book that will be found invaluable in BEd, PGCE and in-service courses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"*Education

Counselor trainees should acquire a sophisticated understanding of how culture shapes perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. Students should also recognize the set of Western assumptions embodied in counseling theory and techniques and that traditional communication and counseling skills may need to be modified in the cross-cultural context.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) ""Children of Color"" fulfills several goals and will be useful in a wide variety of clinical, professional, and educational settings. First, its primary purpose is to present a well-balanced discussion of the issues involved in clinical assessment and treatment of minority children and adolescents from six major ethnic groups and two emerging special population groups. The various contributors cover a range of interventions, from psychodynamic to social cognitive to systems-oriented, with an ecological perspective providing a common thread across groups and serving to integrate the conventional with the more culturally based methods of intervention. Second, a comparative, cross-cultural approach informs each chapter, enabling the reader to compare selected topics (for example, socialization practices, identity formation, coping strategies, assessment issues, treatment approaches) across ethnic groups. Third, the book reflects a major commitment to an ecological perspective that recognizes the significant impact of social and environmental factors, such as poverty, discrimination, immigration, and family structure, on the adaptation and coping patterns of minority children and adolescents. Regrettably, this book could not include every ethnic minority group. We have decided to focus on children and adolescents from six of the larger groups in the United States-Black Americans, Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, American Indians, Mexican Americans, and mainland Puerto Ricans-and two emerging groups, Southeast Asian refugees and biracial youth.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) The fields of Communication and Simulation have each become well established in their own right but no previously published work has examined their increasing interdependence. This volume explores links between the two fields and in it the international group of authors provides insights into how communication and simulation support each other. The authors discuss how simulation can help participants to understanding communication and to practice communication skills. They also emphasise the value of analysing the communication aspects of simulation and show how communication may provide a unifying and conceptual framework for simulation. Drawing together many disparate approaches and perspectives the book provides a unique insight into diverse forms of simulation gaming. Essential reading for every forward-looking educator and trainer. Discussions cover academic and practical applications at both theoretical and applied levels. The book is unique in many ways, particularly in emphasising how we may benefit from looking at communication within simulation and in showing how simulation may help us to understand communication and to become better communicators.
(from the preface) Section One contains just one chapter (by David Crookall and Danny Saunders) which discusses the nature of each field (communication and simulation) taken separately, and then attempts an outline unification. Sections Two, Three, and Four move from micro to macro considerations, while the last section provides a summing up. Section Two, 'Realities and Meanings,' contains six chapters. Both communication and simulation essentially depend on the realities of creating, negotiating, and interpreting meanings and on the meanings of realities. Section Three, 'Social Relations,' covers two of the most studied areas of interest to simulation theorists and designers: interpersonal and intergroup communication. Section Four moves on to concerns more closely associated with institutions and organisations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"*Communication

It is suggested that there is a strong case for universal provision of under-fives care as a right, thus removing the stigma attached to the use of day care for Black families. Further, the training of under-fives workers should be examined and, if necessary, altered to ensure that an anti-racist understanding and approach is central to its purpose. Finally, policies and practices within under-five provision need to be critically examined to evaluate what values are being promoted and what messages are being received by Black users about their presence, lifestyle, status, religion, language, and background.

All Ss were aged 3.9-5.5 yrs. Responses to formal and informal curricula dealing with aspects of human diversity (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, exceptionality) were analyzed, as were interaction patterns. Findings show that, although both programs emphasized acceptance of individual differences, few planned activities dealt with race or cultural diversity. Programs were seen as more consistent with a human relations approach, not fully implementing multicultural education. The use of nonsexist language and nonbiased materials and teachers' attempts to prevent gender stereotyping were found to have positive, though limited, effects.

Accordingly, in this article, I report the results of a 21-culture study of the Chinese Value Survey (CVS) and a 9-culture study of the Rokeach Value Survey (RVS). The analysis began with a ""deculturing"" of the data to remove the cultural positioning effect, then proceeded with a pooled factor analysis to discover pancultural patterns of association among the values. Two factors emerged from the CVS, four from the RVS. The individuals in each survey were then given factor scores, which were analyzed for sex and culture effects. Average scores for individuals from the cultures common to both surveys suggest that the CVS contained a dimension of valuing not found in the RVS. The discussion focuses on the factors' validity, their use in cross-cultural research, and the potential of different cultural traditions for extending psychology's conceptual net.

The practice comes in the second half of the book; in the first half, I am introducing what we shall be practising with. For a number of years, people have been using the Descriptive Psychology formulation of the Person Concept in a wide variety of areas, and have found that its application stretches from the esoteric reaches of computer science to the intricacies of social organizations and multicultural interactions, and to the profundities of spirituality, as well as to psychotherapy, education, criminal investigation, the nature of consciousness, and everyday life.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) Unique in its honest confrontation with real problems and its challenge to many assumptions and practices in education and public policy, this book rests on the conviction that equal opportunity in formal education is necessary but not sufficient to enable students to achieve socioeconomic success in adult life. The author demonstrates the importance of social relations that are not restricted to the classroom, such as mutually shared values and communication patterns. By focusing on the clash of socioeconomic styles that often coincides with desegregation, Hanna offers explanations for aggressive and other disruptive school behavior and then presents coping strategies for parents, teachers, governments, the private sector, and concerned citizens. ""Disruptive School Behavior"" illuminates widespread educational problems on a national scale.
(from the preface) This book is written for educators (including parents); for students of public policy, communication, social interaction, urban problems, ethnic relations, American studies and play; and for all those individuals in a variety of institutions attempting faithfully and in good will to equalize equal opportunity and justice.

Therefore, the objectives of this book are to help counselors in training to (a) examine their and others attitudes and feelings toward ethnic minority persons and to change those negative attitudes, (b) gain cultural knowledge about ethnic minorities in order to dispel myths and stereotypes and to feel more comfortable in working with them, (c) become more flexible in their perspective on working with ethnic minorities, and (d) become more aware of issues, future trends, and challenges encountered and to be encountered by helping professionals. These goals and objectives will be achieved through a variety of practical, action-oriented, nonthreatening, person to person experiences. This book is more than a text on procedures for training multicultural counselors. Rather, it is a book of directed personal growth experiences involving selected ethnic minorities toward preparing the learning to live and function effectively in a multicultural world.

(from the introduction) This volume is unique in several ways. First, it focuses on the social issues related to television, asking important questions about public policy regarding broadcasting. Second, it combines the views of several different interest groups: media researchers, television industry representatives, media critics, and public officials involved in regulation of public communication. Third, it focuses on a mix of topic areas. It begins with consideration of the environmental context of television, including the technological, economic, and organizational constraints under which the industry operates, the views of critics and of the public, and public policy considerations involved in regulation of the industry. Next it takes up the issue of television's portrayal of various social subgroups, such as women and ethnic minorities, and how the industry monitors such role portrayals and other program content. Then it turns to the controversial issue of violence on TV and assesses the evidence concerning its effects on viewers. The following topic presents the other side of the coin: television's potential for promoting prosocial values, and how that potential can be actualized. Finally, the volume discusses social science research on television and speculates about the future of television in terms of viewers' attitudes and behavior, technological changes, and developments in theoretical views about media effects.

A reformulation of the construct of empathy is suggested so that cultural/historical factors may become more clearly addressed.

Its six chapters are wide-ranging discussions of ethnographic methods with references to a number of specific research sites. Part I gives the reader a lively exposure to the strengths and weaknesses of ethnography that is essential to an informed appraisal and appreciation of the rest of the volume. The second part, ""Comparative and Cross-cultural,"" supports the claim that anthropological ethnographers have often made, that a cross-cultural perspective is always somewhere in their formulations, whether implicit or explicit. This section shows that we can profitably apply the cross-cultural to contexts within complex, modern societies. The third part, ""At Home in the USA, continues to reinforce a cross-cultural stance, but now in our own multicultural society. This section is divided into two parts, one devoted to migrants and minorities, the other to mainstream USA. . . .

Findings show that the testing approaches most frequently used with LEP students were the common culture approach (which relies on nonverbal measures) and translated tests. An average of 12 psychological, language, and educational tests were used with each LEP child. Only a third of the LEAs studied were incorporating multicultural pluralistic approaches in their assessment procedures. Most of the LEAs reported serious shortages in bilingual assessment personnel. It was found that LEAs have tried to cope with this problem in various ways, including the use of trained or untrained interpreters, the use of central teams or contracted professionals, and the use of nonverbal tests administered by nonbilingual personnel.

After normalizing most scores, principal factor analyses of the ability intercorrelations (for each sample separately) were followed by varimax and oblique higher-order promax rotation. For Eskimo Ss 8 1st-order factors accounted for 77% of the total variance; for Nsenga Ss, 7 factors accounted for 73% of the total variance. The factors for each sample correlated highly. While coefficients of congruence for Eskimos with Nsengas showed resemblance between the 2 samples, the factors were the same. Striking resemblance of 3rd-order factors to each other and to the 1st unrotated principal factor appeared. Results support extension of H. A. Witkin's differentiation theory. The Canadian Eskimos' hunting ecology and independence training appears to foster a broad spatial-field independence cluster of abilities and a distinctive cluster involving inductive reasoning from nonverbal stimuli. Agricultural ecology and socialization, tending toward conformity and obedience in Nsenga culture, goes with test results that show inductive reasoning task results merging with those of verbal and educational task results.

As a research review the book is limited by the literature it reports, and insufficient attention is overtly paid to racism and exploitation and the ways in which these might be supported by schooling. Tomlinson's conclusions, in which closer home-school relationships are held to be `crucial to the success of a multicultural society', may also appear somewhat anodyne in a state where school successes for black minorities do not alleviate massive discrimination in the labour market and wherein youth unemployment casts a very long shadow indeed. In particular the clear delineation of a `mismatch in expectations' between white teachers and black parents is a valuable contribution. However it will take more than an improvement in home-school relations and an acknowledgement of a `multicultural society' to meet the legitimate expectations of black parents that their children should succeed.

Corner has edited a book of papers which by and large supplement the long tradition of writings on 'comparative Education'. Each paper reflects the rather individual interest of the contributors. Overall, a rather wide variety of multicultural societies are examined, and it is somewhat difficult to transfer the issues exposes in one situation to others where the political and economic background differs. Moreover there is generally rather little attention paid to `racial' and economic differentiation: language and culture are the predominant frames of analysis.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, The Multicultural Curriculum by James Lynch (1983). The book deals, in their different ways, with the issues that have been highlighted in recent years by the presence of black children in schools, and people of other cultures within the polity of the United Kingdom. Lynch's much shorter volume is one man's 'concise guide to current thinking on the multicultural curriculum, and to the practical initiatives which are available for its construction and implementation'. As such it has the degree of cohesion which a single mind can give to the mass of information and opinion over a very broad and complex field, which is represented by its extensive bibliography. Professor Lynch does not make much use of the comments of more radical black teachers and activists. There is no evidence that they will be unequal to the challenge of the multicultural curriculum, provided other educational and social sectors also play their part in the shared enterprise which is multicultural education.

The 44 6-12 yr old children studied were drawn from middle- and lower-class Anglo, Black, and Mexican-American families. Variance in scores was observed between the 2 administrations of HHI; means changed somewhat, and test-retest correlations generally were moderate. Although some variance was attributable to health incidents that occurred between the 2 administrations, some variance was also attributable to respondent inconsistency as noted on questions that should have received the same answer across administrations. Despite this variation, at-risk and not-at-risk classifications made from each HHI were generally stable.

Results of the interviews reveal that Ss did not see the impact of cultural diversity on the organization. Two-thirds did not feel that culture had any effect on the organization or on their roles. Of the remaining one-third, only 1 S saw the impact as positive. The most common reason for lack of cultural impact was the fact that Ss and their clients spoke the same language. 84.4% of Ss who completed the questionnaire stated that they worked in culturally diverse organizations. 83.1% perceived an overall lack of awareness of the impact of culture on the organization. About half of the questionnaire respondents agreed that culture could have a positive influence on the organization and on the OD consultant's job.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Comment/Reply,"Comments on an article by Dr Yuill (see record 2013-23190-002). The article by Yuill raises some mixed issues for Australian management and acknowledges the brush off mentality of government to the unpalatable ideological issues raised by implication. Given current debate and post-1945 multicultural migration policies, it is increasingly difficult to speak in terms of an Australian work culture or ethic, unless polyglot is acceptable. Current government policies aimed at supporting minority cultural groups serves to emphasize difference and may even perpetuate different value systems. Some government policies seem to be aimed at identifying still more criteria of difference which must be acknowledged and accommodated to. Earlier government policies appear to eradicate the economic implications of age differences in terms of employment, while acknowledging significant differences in values and work perspectives. It would appear there can be no Australian value system but a wildly proliferating variety of values, attitudes and expectations of work with which personnel managers try desperately to cope, by balancing government fiat with local requirements and managerial opportunism to produce an efficient workforce.

Facilitator behaviour, in the form of interactions with course members and selection of learning activities, has been found to be fundamental to the development and maintenance of a positive learning climate in a multicultural group. Facilitators contemplating on training multicultural groups need to consider their attitudes and the way these are expressed in their behaviour before their training efforts can be successful.

In the present study, these contradictions are traced to ambiguities pertaining to the definition of orientations and to the influence of the milieu on the acquisition process. This study assessed the influence of ethnicity (French vs. English), milieu (unicultural vs. multicultural). and target second language (French or English vs. Spanish) on the emergence of orientations. The subjects were 871 grade 11 students distributed in eight groups obtained by permutations of the above three factors. The ratings given to 37 reasons for learning the target language were factor analyzed separately for each sample, thus generating eight six-factor structures. The 48 factors were then correlated and factor analyzed in order to delineate clusters of orientations which would be common to all samples or to subsets of the samples. The results show that instrumental, friendship, travel, and knowledge orientations were common to all groups, while five orientations resulted from specific combinations of ethnicity and target language, on the one hand, and milieu, on the other hand. These results are discussed with respect to the influence of the learning context on orientations and in terms of their implications for further studies.

Intercultural Counselling and Assessment is an edited volume of papers presented to an invited Symposium on Intercultural Counselling held at Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario, 1983. The intention of the publication, as stated by the editors, was to fill the gap in guidelines and methods in intercultural counselling by providing source material that is both theoretical and practical. The book is geared to professionals in the field of education, psychology, and social work, with the goal of engendering ""greater sensitivity and a more professional approach to the task of coping with an increasingly varied and mixed population of students in schools"" (p. xvii). The strength of the book lies in its comprehensive coverage. The philosophy of counselling conveyed in the book reflects the orientation of multiculturalism in Canadian immigration policy. Six chapters address the issues and answers in counselling specific ethnic and cultural groups, including Chinese immigrants, South Asian immigrants, West Indian immigrants, European immigrants, Native Canadians, and foreign students. Another six chapters provide the background and guidelines for counselling minorities in specific environments, such as in employment, correctional service, disability service, and education. It is a comprehensive volume and has highlighted the important issues that counsellors should become familiar with in an intercultural society.

The editors have managed to put together an impressive collection of contributors and contributions. Their stated aim is ""to cover the entire spectrum of potential factors related to multiculturalism"" and they ""feel sure that this volume will meet the needs of teacher educators...inservice training...and teacher training in the foundations of multicultural education"" (p. vii). The volume is divided into five parts. Part one contains chapters under the rubric of Policies of Multiculturalism. Part two contains five chapters under the rubric of Attitudes toward Multiculturalism. Part three contains six chapters under the rubric of Language in a Multicultural Society. Part four contains eight chapters under the rubric of Adaptation to a Multicultural Society. Part five contains six chapters under the rubric of Assessment and Counselling in Multicultural Society. In sum, this volume contains many fine individual chapters. Students and professors can pick through them and find the ones best suited for their unique purposes. When taken as a whole, however, the volume represents an ethos which is probably irreconcilable with a genuine multiculturalism.

Reviews the book, Children and Race by David Milner (1983). Race, in this book, means essentially black and white. Although this focus accurately reflects the current research emphasis, it is unfortunate that there is so little attention paid to other racial and ethnic groups. The author reviews recent research showing that black children are much more likely to show a preference or liking for their own race now than was the case in earlier research. The author provides a thorough, research based discussion of important and often controversial issues such as the development of racial attitudes and identity, race and school achievement, and multicultural education. The author ends with a strong statement of the possible role of schools in facing and dealing with racism, based on British experience. Multicultural education should not consist of an occasional unit on ethnic food, dances, or customs, as is often the case, the entire curriculum needs to include multiethnic materials. This book is a good starting point to achieve that goal.

Although the editors, and the subtitle, claim that this volume is focused on the experience of living and working for long periods in cultures other than one's own, that is only half true. The first half of the book is taken up with intercultural training in educational institutions, including elementary schools, secondary schools, and universities. As a result, the two halves of the book are cast at somewhat different levels. The four chapters that make up Part I are more abstract, dealing in generalities about goals, objectives, training paradigms, challenges, and opportunities. The best chapters in Part II are on sub-Saharan Africa, Australia, and Japan. Each provides a close, detailed look at cultural differences that can be problematic for Americans trying to live and work in these countries.

The majority of Ss were White and 46% were male. Ss and their teachers completed a questionnaire assessing their THP attitudes. Data confirm the influence of gender and age on THP. It is suggested that traditional time use (dictated by parents and teachers) and opportunity time use patterns (dictated by economic market forces) are 2 important underlying dimensions to students' attitudes toward their time use. As students progress through school, the traditional parental influence on THP is very strong for girls but is already changing for boys-from traditional to opportunity patterns. For both boys and girls, the 8th grade seemed to be a major milestone where THP changed more toward an opportunity and integrated THP. It is noted that student attitudes toward time use might play an important role in determining educational aspirations of students and the degree of discord between teachers and students. Classroom problems at schools in a multicultural setting might be particularly influenced by disparities in student THPs among the various ethnic and cultural groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Notes that Nigerian society today exhibits symptoms of serious moral malaise and that there is consequently widespread concern about the nation's moral predicament. It is suggested that the problem appears to lie mainly in the uncritical adoption of the values of an alien culture, particularly the values of individualism and materialism in social, political, and economic relations. Since current approaches to moral education in Nigerian schools have been considered inadequate to cope with the contemporary moral crisis, suggestions are made for an exploration of other approaches that might strengthen what is of positive value in the current approach and overcome its deficiencies. It is argued that emphasis on a consequentialist approach within the framework of an integrated approach to moral education will have the advantage of attracting the widest possible audience and making the greatest impact on the multicultural Nigerian society.

Ss anonymously completed questionnaires asking for demographic information and tapping their achievement goals and orientations. Results reveal cultural and sex differences in athletic goals. Anglo males were more likely to define sport success in terms of ability, while Anglo females and Mexican-American Ss tended to emphasize effort. For sports failure, Anglo males emphasized low effort while the other groups stressed low ability. Variations in preferred achievement orientations were also revealed. In the athletic setting, females showed the least preference for success that reflected on the individual and involved social comparison, whereas males indicated the least preference for individual-oriented, social comparison-based failure. It is concluded that awareness of achievement-related cultural and sexual differences can be used to maximize motivation in multicultural athletic and academic situations.

An item analysis conducted with 93 undergraduates yielded 21 items with part-whole correlations. The reliability and validity phase involved 94 undergraduates and a Reserve Officer's Training Corps of 37 Ss who were compared with 27 Ss from a nuclear freeze group. The control validity phase involved 77 undergraduates who were administered the scale to measure attitudes toward disarmament and other scales, including measures of attitudes toward the USSR, religious orthodoxy, and internationalism-nationalism. Findings show that a strong sense of nationalism combined with negative attitudes toward the USSR best predicted negative attitudes toward nuclear disarmament. Although other factors, such as economic conservatism and religious orthodoxy, are marginally related, it is clearly nationalism and stereotypic views of the USSR that account for the nuclear arms race. These results suggest an obvious need for better multicultural education and informed debate on the USSR aimed at removing the worst hysteria produced by cold war indoctrination.

In Exp I, 34 Malay and 34 Chinese male Malaysan university students were asked to ascribe to internal or external causes the behavior of ingroup and outgroup members performing socially desirable or undesirable acts. The hypothesis was supported only for the Malays, whereas the Chinese favored the outgroup. These results were consistent with a limited analysis of auto- and heterostereotypes. Exp II, with 60 Singaporean male university students, revealed ingroup favoritism for the Malays once again, although the Chinese no longer favored the outgroup. These less extreme results mapped onto the stereotypes and mirrored the more multicultural environment in Singapore. Differences between the studies are discussed in terms of wider sociostructural and cultural influences that indicate that ethnocentric attribution is not a universal tendency.

Included are the standard error of the difference between each part score and the mean of all scores and values required for statistical significance at the traditional significance levels of .05 and .01. Results indicate large intercorrelations of the ABIC, which shows that children will not show a large number of significant fluctuations in their profiles. The ready availability of this information should enhance application of the ABIC in clinical practice and facilitate research on its efficacy for educational planning and placement of children in various regular and special education programs.

In this book the author outlines several problems in educating multicultural counselors: ignorance of personal characteristics of culturally different clients, limitations in traditional personality theories and intervention techniques, and deleterious effects of prejudice. The reader would have been more able to sort out the relevance of traditional theories and of intra- and extrapsychic factors to conflict, and its resolution, if the last three chapters on culturally sensitive theory and technique had been presented first. The search for competent counselors of culturally different clients will continue to be elusive unless the search covers didactic and subjective deficiencies in the counselor. The author's response to the didactic limitations is timely and helpful.

A procedure developed by the present authors to detect linguistic insecurity is described, and a pilot study testing this self-correction approach is presented. The self-correction measure was given to 18 dialect speakers in a remedial English class at a community college. Ss included 6 Hispanics of varied origins, 2 West Indians, 8 native American Blacks, 1 S from the Philippines, and 1 S from Bangladesh. In the self-correction procedure, Ss were tape-recorded while describing 4 pictures depicting situations. The recorded verbal samples were then played back, and Ss rated the descriptions and had the opportunity to change them if they wished. Findings indicate that the self-correction procedure distinguished between Ss who showed general satisfaction with their own spoken language from those who showed a persistent inclination to change or correct what they had said. Ss who tended to express dissatisfaction with a large proportion of their own utterances also showed the socioeconomic profile associated with vulnerability to linguistic insecurity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Reviews the literature to suggest a rationale for a lack of representation in state-of-the-science research in current assessment practices, describe alternative measures, and offer a perspective on the use of intelligence tests with traditional and acculturated American Indian children. Recent findings question the internal consistency of the WISC-R and document item bias for American Indian children. A pattern of spatial > sequential > conceptual > acquired knowledge holds across ages, tribes, and heterogeneous referral sources, except for acculturated children. A culturally learned basis for intellectual functioning among traditional children supports alternative assessment functions for traditional reservation lifestyle and for acculturation and entry into mainstream society. It is suggested that performance measures including the Draw-A-Man test, the System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment, and Piagetian and Luria-derived tasks may provide less biased intelligence estimates. While recent legislation outlines ethical practice, assessors are still using conventional measures that are thought to be ethically questionable and discriminatory. Suggestions for increasing awareness of responsible practice, including training in cultural contents and constant monitoring of research findings, are discussed.

Knowledge of one's own cultural values, beliefs, and assumptions are essential before effective interaction with persons from other cultures is possible. Training methods should concentrate on experiential learning and discussion. There should also be provision for some interaction with members of other cultural groups.

There was no evidence of the self-group rejection on the part of ethnic minority group pupils reported in earlier studies. The most favorably stereotyped outgroup was the English and the least favorable was Pakistani. There was no evidence of strong solidarity among the Indian, Pakistani, and West Indian Ss to the exclusion of the White British.

A historical review and the present author's experiences as a teacher in a southern school district illustrate the extent of racism in the US, a problem that has affected Native Americans, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Asian Americans, in addition to Black Americans. Although events of the past must be overcome, ME should be a force that propels society into the future. ME consists of effective teaching and should regard cultural behaviors and differences as teaching and learning tools. The primary goal of ME should be to develop intellectually autonomous students who buttress a commitment to racial equality with skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values requisite to living in a democracy.

Licensure now is required of most academic psychologists, who are expected to practice as well as teach and do research. Although all Greek psychologists must be trained abroad, this multicultural education provides opportunity for broader theoretical perspectives; however, this same multicultural orientation may also pose difficulties in establishing standards for practice.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Proposes that, within the field of education, cultural pluralism (CP) offers the right of every American child to maintain his/her identity with home and community socialization experiences. CP rejects the deficit model, which holds that children from minority culture (MC) backgrounds often come to school with cultural and linguistic defects that must be remedied. It is not suggested that English is not to be a part of the curriculum, but it is suggested that English acquisition should be an additive process, not a replacement. In terms of special education, CP is a factor because many MC children are placed in special education due to cultural, linguistic, and/or racial differences. In many public schools, cultural differences are still translated as deviant, deficient, disabled, and/or disadvantaged. For lack of a better label, many are identified as learning disabled. For those MC students who do have handicaps, the issue of cultural differences is as pertinent to their education as the issue of their learning disabilities. The problems associated with identifying disabilities in MC youngsters are complicated by a lack of understanding of the various cultures; discrimination associated with referral, assessment instruments, and placement; and the virtual nonexistence of teacher training and certification programs that combine special and bilingual/multicultural education methods.

Peer-Reviewed Status-Unknown",Journal Article,"Presents some of the major questions and problems concerning tests and low test performances by minority students, noting that minority educators believe the impact of test use and misuse has been severe for minority students. Issues underlying the low test performance of minority students are discussed with regard to minority and researchers' concerns, misuse of IQ tests, and competence testing. Although tests have been misused in the past, there are constructive uses for standardized testing; test results are important to decisions that national, state, and local school administrators make about education programs and are also useful in school counseling. Research conclusions and the design of enrichment and remedial programs have evolved out of information provided by tests, but the resulting programs have been ineffective in improving the condition of minority students. Tests are measures of learning, and test scores must be interpreted in terms of environmental, biological, and cultural factors that condition test performance. Psychometricians studying the purpose of tests disagree on the appropriate norming procedure and the role that tests should play in determining academic standing. It is concluded that schools are challenged as never before to meet the emerging educational needs of a changing, multicultural society and must assure that the important functions of academic diagnosis, placement, educational accountability, and communication on the meaning of test results are conducted equitably for all students.

Many international students in the US place high priority on academic adjustment and view interpersonal happiness as a social accessory. Counselors cannot expect all international students to engage in warm, intimate relationships during counseling. For students whose value orientations to their own culture are low, there is a higher probability these students may actively participate in the counseling session. Conversely, it might be that international students who participate in a subculture with traditional values seem more restrained and less socially involved during counseling. As counselors and international students interact verbally and nonverbally, they need to use a mutually intelligible code. Multicultural counselors seek to understand the values of persons across cultures. This kind of counseling cannot occur until there is a reasonable understanding and tolerance of the international student's value orientation. Therefore, counselors need to examine their own values in their relationships to international students.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Survey data from 76 of the 106 American Psychological Association-accredited clinical psychology programs indicate that 31 programs offered a total of 57 courses that prepared students to work with minority populations. Most of these courses were taught by 16 programs. There was no relationship between whether a program had a minority faculty member and whether minority-related courses were offered. Program directors acknowledged the large variability of opinion among their faculty on the importance of minority training, and some indicated that little was being done to prepare clinical psychologists to work with minority groups. A comprehensive multicultural approach to preparing minority- and majority-culture students to work with minority populations was poorly represented in coursework, clinical practicum, research training, and language requirements for the PhD degree in clinical psychology. Some issues regarding models for inclusion of minority content in training are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Reviews cross-cultural research on micro-organizational behavior conducted during the past decade and introduces a conceptual framework for classifying the studies. It is argued that much of the current research fails to specify ""culture"" adequately, and because the cultures studied are often ""targets of opportunity,"" pancultural theories of organizational behavior have not emerged. Methodologically, although an improvement over the literature reviewed in K. H. Roberts (1970) is evident, there remains an inadequate concern for the culture-specific nature of behavior, for alternative hypotheses that might also explain findings, and for achieving proper equivalence in translation. It is proposed that future researchers examine more carefully their rationale for doing cross-cultural research, commit themselves to theory, adopt a more rigorous concern for suitable methodologies, and form multicultural teams to achieve these ends.

Some problems may include the militancy of some minority students, the adjustment of some foreign students to being perceived as a racial minority, and the implementation of nontraditional counseling techniques by minority students. It is suggested that counseling programs should provide opportunities for students to specialize in multicultural counseling as a specialty similar to family, behavioral, and group therapy.

Chapters highlight the efforts involved in development of the AAMD Adaptive Behavior Scale (ABS) and its public school version and Mercer's System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment (SOMPA). The book is the first and currently the sole monograph addressing an urgent question raised by this legislation: What measures of adaptive behavior are available? The volume editors are also concerned about the application of adaptive behavior scales in educational settings.

This is a seriously needed and long overdue text in the field of counseling and psychotherapeutic intervention for minority clients. Its purpose is to provide theoretical, clinical, historical, and cultural information for practitioners working with ethnic minority students, and it advocates a multicultural or ethnospecific approach to their counseling. In any emerging field, the pioneering texts are bound to have problems, and this text is no exeption. However, this text provides more extensive information on case materials, practical procedures, and techniques for working with minority students than does any previous book.

It is argued that the role of psychiatrists in a multilingual, multicultural society is to be reassuring by warning against the short-sighted view that bilingualism is harmful by demonstrating its positive values for mental health.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Summarizes the results from 3 major studies on characteristics of J. Mercer and J. Lewis's System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment (SOMPA). The Adaptive Behavior Inventory for Children (ABIC) did not correlate strongly with intelligence and achievement for the racial-ethnic groups. Representative SOMPA measures have been standardized as California norms; comparative ABIC data on Mexican-American children showed the most significant differences among lower-class Mexican-American children. The California norms also showed weak correlations between the WISC-R and achievement. Data analyses indicate that further research is needed on the national representativeness of the California sample. Comparative intercorrelational data between racial-ethnic groups show that pluralistic norms may be needed for correct interpretation of WISC-R through the SOMPA's Estimated Learning Potential (ELP). The use of ELP has reduced the numbers of minority group children identified as retarded. It is implied that SOMPA's comprehensive test system be applied with analytical and evaluative care.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Comment/Reply,"In response to papers by R. A. Figueroa, F. Brown, J. F. Goodman, and T. Oakland (see PA, Vol 62:14860, 14851, 14865, and 14888, respectively), the issues raised in reviews of the System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment (SOMPA) are examined. The SOMPA is viewed as a psychometric system containing valid test measures that, when properly used, lead to unbiased educational decisions. Concepts on assessment models and discrimination are defined and evaluated on the basis of validity and predictive measures. Common fallacies in the use of the assessment models are ""medicalizing"" behavioral assessment, reifying the concept of ""intelligence,"" interpreting ignorance as stupidity, using undifferentiated concepts of validity, and perpetuating edumetric vs psychometric fallacy. Specific SOMPA measures are analyzed in relation to their functional roles. Opposition to the concept of nondiscriminatory assessment suggests the need for more supplementary educational services as well as a change in laws and institutional arrangements to avoid unfair labeling. It is concluded that SOMPA's structural framework provides a full array of assessment measures in support of the mandates of Public Law 94-242, Education of the Handicapped Act.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Reviews the recent publication of J. Mercer and J. Lewis's System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment (SOMPA). According to Mercer (1973), the medical and social system assessment models of human behavior have complicated the evaluation of children's mental function. As a result, the pluralistic model was developed to meet the problem of making medical-model judgments from data secured by social-model tests. Mercer maintains that the WISC-R is misused by school psychologists who offer more placement than educational benefits to children. This contention is disputed by reference to the ambiguity of educational benefits from special classes. The present author believes that Mercer has confused test interpretation by linking tests to models and by underestimating the cultural and biological aspects of behavior. Mercer's description of disease as purely biological and transcultural is viewed as contradictory because of well-known genetic and environmental factors. It is concluded that SOMPA will not increase prediction of school success or clarify the meaning of retardation because of complexities in human behavior.

A major concern is the validity of cultural bases of appropriate testing from legal/historical experience; several court cases have been heard on cultural misrepresentation of test standards. SOMPA's testing specifications are in compliance with 94-242 and are culturally nondiscriminatory; the system of tests is designed to assess culturally different children from medical, social system, and pluralistic perspectives. It is concluded that criticism directed at SOMPA stems from the belief in a homogeneous American society.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Reviews and evaluates psychometric characteristics of the J. Mercer and J. Lewis System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment's (SOMPA) operational models. The medical model measures reflect biological pathology that interferes with psychological functioning and is independent of sociocultural variables. Empirical evidence supports the value of these measures in educational decisions. The social systems model measures are the WISC-R and the Adaptive Behavior Inventory for Children (ABIC), and are associated with the social deviance perspective. ABIC offers to conceptualize a child's adaptive behavior in nonacademic social roles and has potential application for clinical work and in research. The pluralistic model is characterized by multiple norm groups that are used on an individual comparative basis; sociocultural scales and estimated learning potential (ELP) are the 2 sets of measures. Transformation of WISC-R IQs into ELPs may require procedural clarification to validate ELP scores in conjunction with school functioning level. It is concluded that there is a lack of evidence of the validity of proposed test measures.

Cultural value systems may be mutually exclusive at certain points, and a school must make value priorities in deciding how it is going to operate. Once value priorities are made, the values of a majority or minority population within the school may be discriminated against. If minority people in the US are to succeed in economic terms they must be able to function in a society based on White middle-class skills and values. Multicultural education, then, must include provisions for minority peoples to learn to operate in the world of the majority. Multicultural education can thus take 2 alternative forms. It can involve a system of real equal educational opportunity for minority students in schools run according to the principles of the White middle-class majority or it can involve the creation of bilingual, bicultural schools in which all students learn to operate in 2 differing cultural contexts. Multicultural education cannot ignore the value system of mainstream America, or it will result in the maintenance of separate and economically unequal communities.

Apart from ""rustiness"" as a teacher of young children, she faced the physical obstacles of building construction, double sessions, lack of supplies, and lack of storage for those available. Contrasts between college and elementary teaching, and conflicts among models of teaching also posed challenges. During the school year, the children moved from negative attitudes toward Spanish to enjoyment of bilingualism; they invented spellings, delighted in reading nonsense materials, and displayed a sense of humor about language. Knowledge of developmental, cultural, and situational influences on children's language is seen as both helpful and limiting for the teacher. Suggestions for future research are given in the areas of (a) children's functional competence with language and (b) the language of teaching, which encompasses more than words. Final thoughts focus on the relationships among psychological distance, social settings, and use of language by pupils and teachers.

The relationships of these behaviors to each other, to perceptual-cognitive ability, to language used in the home, and to family socioeconomic and educational status; the stability of the behaviors over time and across programs; and the effects and interactions of ethnic group membership, grade level, and sex on behavior were examined. Findings of ethnic differences may be related to either (a) differential understanding of portions of the programs due to the language spoken, or (b) differential appeal of the material, (c) culturally determined differences in the degree, frequency, and pattern in which the behaviors studied are produced in each of the ethnic groups, or (d) cultural differences in the observers.

Cultural pluralism is viewed as an appreciation of ways in which different peoples satisfy universal needs. It involves learning how to become familiar with unfamiliar cultures (e.g., how to classify objects, ideas, and problems in general categories). A partially contrived example is given of needs assessment for cultural pluralism at the school level in a Mexican-American community. It illustrates formulation of goals, setting goal priorities, identification of enabling goals, translating goals into educational plans and instruction, and selection of measures and techniques for assessing the present status of the learner.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Delineates 2 trends in developmental psychology: (a) the ""capitalistic"" orientation of the Anglo-American countries, elaborated within the tradition of Darwin and Galton; and (b) the ""mercantilistic-socialistic"" orientation of the European continent, elaborated within the tradition of Rousseau and Piaget. The former implies a model of continuous growth in which all individuals are evaluated against single standards, e.g., the white achievement-oriented intelligence test; the latter implies qualitative growth models and encourages multigenerational and multicultural standards. An integration of these viewpoints is attempted by emphasizing a dialectic interaction model and by relying on Rebinstein's notion of ""constitutive relationism."" The dependency of growth upon sociocultural contingencies is demonstrated through studies on the recall of historical events, and the dependency of growth upon biological contingencies is demonstrated through theories from cellular biology. The dynamic character of the interaction processes, i.e., their changes with individual and historical time, is discussed in reference to modern developmental research designs. (56 ref.)

Visual and audio supplements exist, but combined audiovisual accessories are not available for most basal series. Illustrations have become more varied and readers tend to be numbered consecutively by levels rather than identified with specific grades. 3 recent trends in regard to objectives are noted: (a) some support for stressing decoding and de-emphasizing comprehension in early reading stages, (b) increased attention to critical and creative reading, and (c) a very recent interest in behaviorally stated objectives.

The Maori child also copes with his dependency feelings and develops independent behavior in a manner which is quite different from that of the European child. The European-type school system in New Zealand is discussed as unicultural and as thereby denying the validity of bi- and multicultural social systems. As the Maori child enters such an educational system, he experiences a number of conflicts between cultures and role expectations, especially in his relationship to the teacher and in the emphasis on success and failure. It is suggested that the Maori culture has much to teach the European and that the educational system must learn to be responsive to cultural differences. Implications for teachers and teacher training are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Review of the book, ""Intergroup Education and the American College"" (1952) by Marjorie B. Smiley. The foundation for this latest volume of the Teachers College Studies in Education is provided by a detailed and intelligent analysis of the intergroup education programs reported by fifty-six colleges and universities in response to questionnaires submitted by the author. Each chapter presents the philosophy of a certain aspect of intergroup education, a summary of policies and practices of the fifty-six institutions in regard to this aspect, and recommendations for planning a curriculum to deal with this aspect. The emphasis on curriculum development rather than methodology makes it of limited value to most workers in the social sciences. The reviewer notes that neither the author's thoroughness nor her command of the subject and related areas will be challenged by many readers of this volume. Also, the style of the book makes for low readability from the standpoints of both interest and difficulty, and may discourage some readers.
