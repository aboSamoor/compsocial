Edited Book",Chapter,Textbook/Study Guide,"(from the chapter) The election of Barack Hussein Obama as the forty-fourth president of the United States suggests that conventional notions of blackness are being disaggregated. The old hypodescent rule has lost its power to define who is black and who is not, especially for light-skinned black Americans and individuals with some African ancestry and one white parent. Further, conventional racial designations today may be less important than factors such as skin tone, especially when combined with traditional tropes of high-status whiteness like elite education, stable family structure, high socioeconomic status, and ""command of spoken English."" Empirical research suggests the existence of a small group of light-skinned black elites that dates back to the antebellum era who were able to accumulate and pass on small amounts of wealth. The intergenerational transfer of even small amounts of wealth created opportunities for their descendants not available to most black Americans. Today, these' descendants still benefit from the advantages created as a result of light skin tone and relative economic success. This group and the mixed-race children of one white parent are posed to move beyond unitary blackness into a middle group between white and most black Americans. The movement away from unitary blackness may result in a pigmentocracy that reinforces whiteness even as the country becomes less white. One byproduct of this change is that racial inequality between those raced as white and black will become more severe. Twentieth-century antidiscrimination laws that treat blackness as one-dimensional are ill equipped to combat more subtle race-based discrimination. This chapter explores whether skin tone, rather than racial classification or racial self-identification, will, in the near future, determine who gets better access to quality education, jobs, and real power in America; in other words, does color and socioeconomic status, more than old racial classification schemes, matter in the ""post-racial"" Obama era and, if so; what are the legal implications of this development?

Existing research has not yet established the equivalence of the measurement properties of parent CSP across diverse racial-ethnic groups in Canada. Additionally, few studies that incorporate survey-based measures of CSP have determined whether instruments hypothesised to measure parent CSP tap into a phenomenon that is unique from other supportive parenting practices. The current study involves an exploratory investigation of the psychometric properties of a multigroup CSP measure among a sample of 296 parents of young children from diverse racial-ethnic minority (Aboriginal, Black or African, Latin American, Southeast or East Asian, Arab or South Asian, and Mixed Race-Ethnicity) and racial-ethnic majority (White or Western European and Eastern European) groups residing in Canada. The CSP measure used in the current study was derived from existing measures of CSP originally developed for specific racial-ethnic groups residing in the United States. Findings revealed a single CSP construct that was unique from other general supportive parenting behaviours. The CSP construct showed good construct validity across the sample of racial-ethnic minority and majority parents. Differences in the frequency of CSP were found between the racial-ethnic minority and majority parents and between specific racial-ethnic groups. Implications for research on parent CSP are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",,,"While the black population of the USA has grown more diverse with regard to ethnicity and class status, most research on racial identity relies on dichotomous proxies of racial group identification created during the civil rights era. Using a subset of the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity included in the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, a representative sample of black students at twenty-eight selective American colleges and universities, we test how black student racial identity is related to students' ethnic, nativity, socioeconomic, and contextual experiences in childhood. Our more nuanced measure of black racial identity shows that being Black/African American is central to the new generation of black elites' self-identity and that, contrary to prior evidence and theorization that blacks are either assimilationist or nationalist, that black students express strong support for both assimilationist and nationalist ideological beliefs at the same time. In addition, students express strong tendencies toward group membership as well as individualism; race has less of an impact on how they feel about themselves and their social relationships. Further analyses reveal substantial variation in black identity between monoracial and mixed-race blacks, and between immigrant (both first and second generation) and native blacks, but few social class differences. Notably, childhood experiences of racial segregation and social disorganization are also strongly associated with black identity and racial ideologies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",,,"Little research has examined the way in which perceptions of peer behavior (i.e., descriptive norms) influence externalizing behavior among rural adolescents. Using a social norms framework, the current study examined gender differences in the relationship between perceived delinquency among friends and externalizing behavior in a sample of rural adolescents. Based on previous research, the authors proposed that adolescents experience negative emotional responses when they believe that their peers are engaging in delinquency, which subsequently influences externalizing behavior. Consequently, internalizing symptoms were explored as a mediator of the relationship between perceived friend delinquency and externalizing behavior. Data came from the NC-ACE Rural Adaptation Project, a longitudinal panel study of adolescents in two rural, economically disadvantaged counties with exceptional racial/ethnic diversity (29 % White, 25 % African American, 25 % American Indian, 12 % Mixed Race/Other, 9 % Hispanic/Latino). Using multiple group structural equation modeling (N = 3489; 51 % female), results indicated that perceived friend delinquency was significantly related to externalizing behavior and this relationship did not vary by gender. Internalizing symptoms fully mediated the relationship between perceived friend delinquency and externalizing behavior and the path between perceived friend delinquency and internalizing symptoms was stronger for males. Implications of these relationships for prevention and intervention programming for externalizing behavior were highlighted.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Social work scholarship concerned with mixed-race and queer identities is growing and ever-changing, yet often treats race and sexuality as separate experiences independent from context and environment. In addition, in studies of mixed-race people, the legacy of the Black-White/US-based multiracial paradigm and the history of such research using race as the only or primary analytic has left a dearth of studies that seek to understand mixed-race experiences within geographical, transnational and intersectional contexts. In this paper, we extend previous work focused on situational and contextual multiracial identities through an interview-based study of a sample of 12 queer and mixed-race individuals. We employ a narrative analysis to explore how emergent themes of geography and migration are salient to self-making processes of participants. Findings include: (1) diverse geographic and migration histories among participants; (2) interviewees' use of discursive strategies that draw upon experiences of geography and migration within the narrative structure; and (3) the critical role of geography and migration in expanding and changing participants' identity discourses and in shaping individuals' identity and sense of community. Ultimately, this work serves as a call for on-going attention to how geography and migration, as well as intersectional and transnational perspectives, add depth and texture to studies of queer-mixed people while also offering specificity to social work's broader commitment to context and environment.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"According to the 2010 U.S. census, approximately 9 million individuals report multiracial identities. By the year 2050, as many as one in five Americans could claim a multiracial background. Despite this population growth, a review of recent empirical and theoretical literature in social work suggests a disproportionate lack of attention to issues of multiraciality. Instead, social work practice models remain embedded in traditional societal discourses of race and culture that often exclude or marginalize the experiences of multiracial individuals and families. This article summarizes recommendations following the domains of awareness, knowledge, and skills in the NASW Standards for Cultural Competence in Social Work Practice to support culturally attuned social work practice with multiracial people. The authors argue that a culturally attuned practice approach-one that is inclusive of multiraciality-is not only timely, but also consistent with the profession's ethical obligation to provide culturally relevant services to all consumers and clients.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Critics of emerging adulthood theory have suggested that it only applies to college students, but this assertion has largely gone untested. The purpose of the present study was to compare developmental trajectories of non-students versus college-educated youth in theoretically relevant domains of work, love, and financial independence. Using data from the Youth Development Study (N = 1139, 49.6 % female, 63.3 % White, 10.9 % Southeast Asian, 1.5 % Other Asian, 8.6 % Black, 5.3 % Mixed Race, 4.0 % Latino, 0.8 % Native American), latent growth curve models were fitted to chart each group's development, from ages 14 to 30. Different trajectories were revealed for hours worked, children, and financial dependence on parents, spouses, and government aid. No differences were found in employment rates, marriage rates, or financial dependence on own income. These results provide a clearer picture of emerging adulthood for non-students, and highlight problems with generalizing college student research to all emerging adults.

I had I hoped to propagate a deeper understanding of two main issues: respect for all cultures in South Korea and an illustration of a new way in how social justice concerns function in the multicultural Korean society. This research is also important because it departs from existing art theories and classroom research in Korea, by focusing on the individual child's response to the artistic experience and deals with their artwork on its own merits in terms of how it benefited the child as a whole. While taking theory into account, this study departs from dogmatic adherence to rigid theoretical framework and focuses instead on the deeper response of the individual child. My curriculum consisted of 14 art activities implemented as an after-school program in an existing South Korean multicultural center. My students were of Korean mixed-race origination. Their fathers were Korean and their mothers came from Japan or China. Although there were 15 total students who ranged in age levels from 1st to 6th grade, the majority of the study focuses on two sixth grade girls, Iwha and Eunbie. Their experiences were, in many ways, emblematic of the program as a whole: the challenges they faced, their overall growth, and how they came to contextualize art within a multi-cultural, social justice framework. In order to understand Iwha and Eunbie's response to my curriculum, I used the qualitative research methodology, ""Essentialist Portraiture."" This approach allowed me to understand these two girls on a deeper level. Through the use of questionnaires given to Iwha and Eunbie and interviews with them as well as examination of their artwork, I was able to gain deeper insight into how the program functioned and to use the experience to augment my growth as a teacher. Through intense exploration of Iwha and Eunbie's art and words, I could better understand their response and contextualize it within the larger framework of social justice art in the classroom. During the course of this research, three significant themes emerged: (a) an opening up by Iwha and Eunbie in terms of feeling freedom to pursue their ideas and as a result grow their expressive capability, (b) a development of self-confidence and self-reliance in the girls to help with facing challenges in their personal lives, and (c) an overall growth in Iwha and Eunbie's awareness of their self-value. This expansion in self-awareness was further manifested in three additional dimensions: (a) awareness of self, (b) awareness of social issues, and (c) awareness of cooperation and collaboration with others. Before this study commenced, I was convinced that art should be an essential part of multicultural education programs because it is the one common medium that transcends all cultural barriers. It speaks to the humanness of us all. After analyzing the performance of this curriculum, I am more convinced than ever that the most suitable and beneficial program for social justice educational goals is one that is grounded in a relevant cultural context and that focuses strongly on fostering empathy through art. This dissertation makes suggestions how to improve and expand the curriculum.

Eight diverse married couples were recruited through purposive, criterion and snowball sampling efforts. Couples had been married between a minimum of 2 years and 13 years, and ranged in age from 25 to 56. Participant groups included two African American couples, two Caucasian couples, two mixed race couples where husbands were African American and wives were Caucasian, and two mixed race couples where husbands were Caucasian and wives were African American. One couple in each racial category was targeted whose total household incomes were above and below $40,000 to allow for socioeconomic comparison. Couples defined affectionate expression and it was shown that spouses demonstrated multiple affectionate behaviors with the intention of making their mates feel good about themselves and their relationships, and also to derive some personal benefit associated with showing affection. Satisfaction was explored and it was shown that spouses appreciated affectionate acts that were perceived to be selfless and sincere as opposed to routine or reciprocal, and affectionate demonstrations that were in accord with their personal preferences. When spouses received adequate amounts of affection, they felt more loved, better about themselves, closer to their spouses, more energized in their relationships, and they perceived of their relationships as stronger. Insufficient amounts or inadequate types of affection made spouses feel unloved and question their mate's sincerity, they perceived of their relationships as being ""rocky,"" their mates unhappy, and they felt a general sense of unease. Findings also indicated that satisfaction with affectionate expression inversely affected considerations of divorce. Ethnocultural and socioeconomic difference were examined and not identified in the study. Salient themes of the study included the importance of verbal assurances and of selflessness, sacrifice and sincerity, as behaviors thus perceived most engendered spousal satisfaction.

Peer Reviewed Journal",,,"The hypothesis that father absence during childhood, as well as other forms of childhood psychosocial stress, might influence the timing of sexual maturity and adult reproductive behaviors has been the focus of considerable research. However, the majority of studies that have examined this prediction have used samples of women of European descent living in industrialized, low-fertility nations. This paper tests the father-absence hypothesis using the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS), which samples young adults in Cape Town, South Africa. The sample contains multiple racial groups (blacks, coloureds [mixed race], and whites) and includes both males and females. Dependent variables include age at menarche, age at first sexual intercourse, and age at first pregnancy. Childhood stress is measured by father absence by age six (either never lived with father or lived with father some but not all years) and an index of childhood exposure to violence (measuring threatened or actual verbal or physical abuse). The hypothesis received no support for effect on age at menarche but was supported for age at first sex and first pregnancy. The model showed stronger support for coloureds and whites than blacks and had no predictive power at all for black males.

The results demonstrated that the RSES was psychometrically sound for the five groups. The minimal effects of sociodemographic characteristics on global self-esteem showed that the RSES and its two dimensions, self-competence (SC) and self-liking (SL), were suitable in this setting. All five groups scored above the theoretical midpoint of the RSES, indicating that generally positive self-evaluations appear to be universal. The relationships between positively and negatively worded items, SC, and SL attested to the following: internal structure reliability, congruence between positive and negative items, no negative biases in response, and concordance between SC and SL dimensions. The significant differences between informal settlement residents and the other four groups on global self-esteem, positively and negatively worded items, and SC and SL were possibly due to physiological needs taking precedence over higher order needs.

No studies have examined the role culture plays in smoking behaviors in the context of other commonly cited predictors of behaviors. Participants included 42 students recruited from De Anza 9 th grade Academy in Southern California. The mean age of the students was 15 years old (SD = 0.55). This age group was selected because it is the time when adolescents are most likely to first try smoking. There were 51.2% males and 48.8% females in the sample. The ethnic makeup of students who participated was 71.4% Latino, 14.3% Mixed race, 9.5% Other, 2.4% African American, 2.4% Asian-American, and 0% Anglo. Results indicated that filial piety/respeto did not predict smoking behaviors. Religiosity was the only significant predictor of filial piety. Academic aspiration, peer influence, and perceived risks and benefits of smoking did not mediate the relationship between filial piety and smoking behaviors. Even though the directionality of the relationship between religiosity and filial piety cannot determined from the current study, the significant relationship between these two factors suggests that researchers may want to study the effects of the possible link between religiosity and filial piety. Although intervention programs may not be able to incorporate religion explicitly into their curriculum, such information may be useful to parents as they make decisions about how to raise their family and whether they wish to include religion in their lives. In addition, it may be informative to study the efficacy of smoking prevention programs delivered through churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples. Due to the challenges of this study, some questions remain unanswered. It would be worthwhile to continue to explore the mechanisms of filial piety on peer influence, academic aspiration, and perceptions of smoking using Betancourt's model; as an explanation of adolescent smoking behavior across ethnic groups and using a larger sample size. Moreover, it may be helpful to test the efficacy of anti-smoking programs designed to target adolescents' sense of duty or obligation to their family and parents.

Individuals manage stress in a variety of ways, including engaging in social support. Currently, literature in the areas of stress and social support is abundant. However, literature on both racial and gender differences in stress and social support is quite limited. Thus, this quantitative study explored the racial and gender differences that exist among stressful experiences, quantity of social supports, and relationship to social supports (i.e., friends, relatives, others). Further, the study attempted to determine if there is a relationship between stress and social support from relatives and friends. In order to increase the knowledge base in this area, an archival data set was used which included data from self-report measures including the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983), the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ-6), and general demographic questions. Results indicated that Hispanics appear to have significantly more perceived stress than those who identified as Caucasian and Mixed Race. Additionally, there were not significant relationships between perceived stress and number of friends or number of relatives identified as social supports. The results are discussed in light of the importance of utilizing culturally sensitive measures of stress to accurately assess perceived stress across races. Limitations and areas of future research are discussed.

Across 2 studies, there was evidence for the validation of the 25-item MEM with 5 subscales including Shifting Expressions, Perceived Racial Ambiguity, Creating Third Space, Multicultural Engagement, and Multiracial Discrimination. The 5-subscale structure of the MEM was supported by a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Evidence of criterion-related validity was partially supported with MEM subscales correlating with measures of racial diversity in one's social network, color-blind racial attitude, psychological distress, and identity conflict. Evidence of discriminant validity was supported with MEM subscales not correlating with impression management. Implications for future research and suggestions for utilization of the MEM in clinical practice with multiracial adults are discussed.

In Venezuela, where most citizens are of mixed race and where the concept of race is fluid, race and racism take on more complex forms that include dimensions such as social class, eye color, family, education, and even manners. This means that Whiteness and privilege do not always go hand in hand. I discuss ways in which this culturally defined notion of race can be incorporated into psychotherapy with Latina immigrants to the United States.

In this article, I explain how and why a mixed-race Mapuche shaman charged me with writing about her life and practice in the form of such a ""bible."" This book would become a ritual object and a means of storing her shamanic power by textualizing it, thereby allowing her to speak to a future audience. The realities and powers her ""bible"" stored could be extracted, transformed, circulated, and actualized for a variety of ends, even to bring about shamanic rebirth. Ultimately, I argue, through their use and interpretation of this kind of ""bible,"" Mapuche shamans expand academic notions of indigenous history and literacy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",,,"Positive Action is a school-based program that aims to decrease problem behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use) and increase positive behaviors (e.g., school engagement, academic achievement). Although a number of studies have shown that Positive Action successfully achieves these goals, few studies have evaluated the program's effectiveness in rural schools. Given that rural youth are at an increased risk for risky behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use), this is a critical gap in the existing Positive Action research base. The current study assesses the impact of Positive Action on change rates of self-esteem, school hassles, aggression, and internalizing symptoms in a group (N = 1246, 52 % female) of ethnically/racially diverse (27 % White, 23 % African American, 12 % mixed race/other, 8 % Latino, 30 % as American Indian) middle school youth (age range 9-20) located in two violent, low-income rural counties in North Carolina. One county engaged in Positive Action over the 3-year study window while the other county did not. Following multiple imputation and propensity score analysis, 4 two-level hierarchical linear models were run using each of the outcome measures as dependent variables. The results indicate that the program generates statistically significant beneficial effects for youth from the intervention county on self-esteem scores and school hassles scores. Although the program generates beneficial effects for intervention youth on the change in aggression scores, the finding is not statistically significant. The finding on the change in internalizing scores shows a non-significant detrimental effect: the youth from the comparison county have lower internalizing scores than those from the intervention county. Implications are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This article examines the identity formation of middle-class Haitian youth. Segmented assimilation theory predicts that the Haitian second generation will integrate into the black American underclass or maintain strong ethnic group identities. The black middle class, however, is an unexplored pathway of cultural assimilation. This paper uses the literature on the racial and class experiences of the black American middle class as a departure point for understanding the boundary work of middle-class Haitian youth. Based on qualitative interviews and a focus group, we uncover the mechanisms of identity formation for this invisible population. Racial, ethnic and class boundaries compel Haitian youths to create strategies of either empowerment or distancing. They negotiate between their middle-class status and ethnoracial exclusion in a racially segregated neighbourhood, an ethnically homogenous church and a mixed-race school setting. This study's findings extend our theoretical understandings of middle-class immigrants and their identity work.

As adolescents age into early adulthood, there may be dynamic changes in their substance use behaviors, and these changes may be influenced by family and school factors. The current study uses Latent Transition Analysis to examine these changes by measuring transitions among different substance use profiles based on past 30-day alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use, and by estimating associations with demographic, family and school factors. Data were from youth (n = 850; 80 % African American, 17 % white, 3 % mixed race, 50 % female and 50 % male) in grade 10 (Time 1), with 24- (Time 2) and 48-month (Time 3) follow-ups. Substance use profiles included Non-users (54 %), Alcohol and Marijuana Users (20 %), and Alcohol, Tobacco and Marijuana Users (26 %). There were considerable transitions among profiles from Time 1 to Time 2, and fewer transitions from Time 2 to Time 3. At Time 1, African American race and positive school attitudes were negatively associated with being an Alcohol and Marijuana User, and being an Alcohol, Tobacco and Marijuana User. Family conflict, parental school involvement, female gender and African American race were associated with transitions among substance use profiles. Implications are discussed for a better understanding of transitions in substance use profiles, and for promoting maintenance of non-use and transitions from substance using profiles to non-use.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This paper explores how multiracial parents with White partners articulate narratives of ethnic and racial 'dilution' and cultural loss in relation to the socialization of their children. In our broader study of how multiracial parents raise their children, we found that parents commonly spoke of concerns around dilution and generational change in relation to four key themes: the loss of cultural knowledge and diminishing practices that connected parents and their children to a minority ancestry; the embodiment of White-appearing children and the implications of this for family relationships; the use of biological or genetic discourses in relation to reduced blood quantum; and concerns amongst Black/White participants about whitening and the loss of racial consciousness. Parental understandings of dilution varied greatly; some expressed sadness at 'inevitable' loss; others were more philosophical about generational change; and others still proactively countered loss through strategies to connect their children to their minority heritages. We show that despite growing awareness of the social constructedness of race and an emergent cosmopolitanism among these parents, discourses of genetics, cultural lineage, and the 'naturalness' of race continue to hold sway amongst many multiracial parents.

Vol.60(37), 2015",,American Psychological Association; US,Electronic,Electronic Collection,Review-Media,,"Reviews the film, Black Or White directed by Mike Binder (2014). This film is about the life of Eloise, a mixed-race 7-year-old being raised solely by her White grandfather (Elliot Anderson) following the death of her maternal grandmother (his wife). When Elliot's wife could look after Eloise, Rowena Jeffers, her paternal grandmother who is Black, had been content with the situation, but now, she says, her extended Black family is Eloise's real family, and if the child grows up without them, she will have something fundamental missing from her sense of self. Part of our sociality is to think in terms of in-groups or out-groups, which can depend on things like nationality, gender, race, a sports team we support, and the kind of clothes we wear. With this kind of proclivity, something visible like color, although only skin deep, can be taken as significant. In the human history of international conflict, of socioeconomic status, and of slavery, color has become important because we have made it so. Black or White is a worthwhile film because it is not clear for any of us how much of our mental model of a person comes from assumptions and how much from our history of interaction with that person. How does an idea that ""he's a member of another race"" or ""she's overdressed"" stack up with ""he did something I resent"" or ""she's been really helpful""? We are affected not just by thoughts but by prethoughts. Is it our first thought, or prethought, that counts? This is the question the film puts forth. Best of all, it puts the question in a way that invites us to consider how we feel about such issues, and to think about the issues for ourselves.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) Within the Asian American narrative, one part that is regularly excluded is the story of mixed race Asian Americans. Despite the fact that mixed race Asians, also known as Hapas, make up 15% of the Asian American community and are one of the largest subgroups according to Pew Research Center, they have not been given an equal place in cultural organizations, community leadership, and academic research. According to Beverly Yuen Thompson (2000), ""Within the 'Asian American experience' there is a great deal of diversity that has thus far remained unexplored. Issues of interracial relationships, transracial adoptions, biracial identity, and queer identity have remained marginalized and considered exceptions to an unspoken norm of Asian American identity"". Since Asian Americans are defined by a monolithic term and are viewed by American society as a single entity, any deviations from this normative definition have been excluded. For many Hapa students in college, their cultural and racial differences have resulted in a general exclusion from Asian American and other single-race groups and harsher criticism under the model minority myth (MMM). Through a single, in-depth vignette, our chapter examines the influence of this exclusion and how the MMM operates to hamper student confidence and opportunities to connect with other students on campus, ultimately eroding the quality of the college experience. Additionally, it attempts to shine a light on the mixed race Asian American community and to make a case for why these stories are important in the overall landscape of educational research on Asian Americans and other non-dominant minority groups in general. A discussion of implications and recommendations for greater awareness and sensitivity to mixed-race students and their development in student programming and services as well as questions for further reflection follow. The following question guided our overall inquiry and analysis: What are the stories-perceived and experienced challenges-of those who identify as Hapa during college?

Prewitt focuses on an analysis of racial classification in the US census-the so-called 'statistical races' -and its changing role in US policy, culminating in recommendations for radical change. Carter takes as his theme population mixing across the races, offering a positive, even celebratory, but little known account of the moments and movements that have praised mixing. As pressures mount on the 'statistical races' in the late twentieth century, Prewitt uses the political space opened up by these debates to offer fundamental changes to US methods of ethno-racial data collection, including the removal of these questions from the census.

Peer Reviewed Journal",,,"Given the heightened risk for HIV and other STIs among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) as well as the racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/STI risk, an understanding of longitudinal trends in sexual behaviors is warranted as YMSM emerge into adulthood. Drawing from an ongoing prospective cohort study, the present analysis employed latent growth curve modeling to examine trends in distinct types of sexual activity without condoms over time in sample of YMSM and examine differences by race/ethnicity and perceived familial socioeconomic status (SES). Overall, White and Mixed race YMSM reported more instances of oral sex without condoms as compared to other racial/ethnic groups with rates of decline over time noted in Black YMSM. White YMSM also reported more receptive and insertive anal sex acts without a condom than Black YMSM. Declines over time in both types of anal sex acts without condoms among Black men were noted when compared to White men, while increases over time were noted for mixed race YMSM for condomless insertive anal sex. The effects for race/ethnicity were attenuated with the inclusion of perceived familial SES in these models. These findings build on previous cross sectional studies showing less frequent sex without condoms among Black YMSM despite higher rates of HIV incidence in emerging adulthood, as well as the importance of considering economic conditions in such models. Efforts to understand racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/STIs among YMSM must move beyond examination of individual-level sexual behaviors and consider both race/ethnicity and socioeconomic conditions in order to evaluate how these factors shape the sexual behaviors of YMSM.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Introduction: Interest has increased in understanding the types and healthfulness of restaurant foods for children, particularly in disadvantaged areas. The purpose of this community-based participatory research study was to describe the quality of restaurant food offered to children in a health-disparate region in Virginia and North Carolina and to determine if the availability of healthy foods differed by location (rural, urban) or by the predominant race (black, white, mixed race) of an area's population. Methods: Restaurants offering a children's menu in the 3 counties in Virginia and North Carolina that make up the Dan River Region were identified by using state health department records. Research assistants reviewed menus using the Children's Menu Assessment (CMA), a tool consisting of 29 scored items (possible score range, -4 to 21). Scores were calculated for each restaurant. We obtained information on the predominant race of the population at the block group level for all counties from 2010 US Census data. Results: For the 137 restaurants studied, mean CMA scores were low (mean, 1.6; standard deviation [SD], 2.7), ranging from -4 to 9 of 21 possible points. Scores were lowest for restaurants in the predominantly black block groups (mean, 0.2; SD, 0.4) and significantly different from the scores for restaurants in the predominantly white (mean, 1.4; SD, 1.6) and mixed-race block groups (mean, 2.6; SD, 2.4) (F = 4.3; P < .05). Conclusion: Children's menus available in the Dan River Region lack healthy food options, particularly in predominantly black block groups. These study findings can contribute to regional efforts in policy development or environmental interventions for children's food quality by the community-based participatory research partnership and help local stakeholders to determine possible strategies and solutions for improving local food options for children.

Great attention is given to tracing Mexico's dominant conceptions of racial mixing, from Spanish colonization to Mexico's post-Revolutionary period. Although mestizaje continues to be a constant point of reference in U.S. Latino/a discourse, not enough attention has been given to how this ideology has been complicit with white supremacy and the exclusion of indigenous people. Mestizofilia, the dominant mestizaje ideology formulated by white and mestizo elites after Mexico's independence, proposed that racial mixing could be used as a way to ""whiten"" and homogenize the Mexican population, two characteristics deemed necessary for the creation of a strong national identity conducive to national progress. Mexican intellectuals like Vicente Riva Palacio, Andres Molina Enriquez, Jose Vasconcelos and Manuel Gamio proposed the remaking of the Mexican population through state sponsored European immigration, racial mixing for indigenous people, and the implementation of public education as a way to assimilate the population into European culture. I argue that although Mexican Americans inherited this Eurocentric formulation of mestizaje, by the mid-1960s their specific social position as a negatively racialized and economically exploited population in the United States allowed self-identified Chicana/o activists and intellectuals to depart significantly from, and in some cases, clearly critique inherited Eurocentric conceptions of racial mixing and racist views of indigenous people. Chicano/a discourse of mestizaje and indigeneity is not an uncritical reproduction of dominant Mexican mestizofilia and indigenismo, it is a collective, and sometimes deeply personal, exploration of mixed race ancestry that sought to recuperate, and in some cases, center the indigenous. Chicano/as' historical and practical context made some of their claims to indigeneity, including those dealing with spirituality, not only oppositional, but also decolonizing. Through an interdisciplinary approach grounded in Chicano/a studies, this study critically examines a broad array of texts by Mexican and Chicana/o intellectuals, including political speeches, historical texts, and literature.

First, I frame opening questions related to space, race, landscape, and identity, using the metaphor of walking. Secondly, I outline my notion of ""mixed methods"" for the study, which I call ""a moving methodological mestizaje."" Third, I weave personal narrative and poetry to I examine what it means to come to racial consciousness as a biracial, mixed-race person of color in the Midwest-South. Reflecting on the geographic and cultural features of Southern Illinois, I come to understand the region of the country as a ""borderlands."" Following Gloria Anzaldua's writing, I identify myself as ""a mestizo,"" or person of mixed race ancestry, but in the context of the Southern Illinois. The title poem of the dissertation expands on ""mulatez"" or African mestizaje to articulate an Afro-Latino political alliance. Fourth, I explore multiple space that I have lived across the country, to examine qualities of Whiteness to ultimately work against White identity. Then, I deploy the metaphor of drinking hot sauce as a reclaiming Mexican, Aztec mythopoetic. I come to name myself as ""Merry Midwest Mestizo,"" to fully embrace my biracial, Latino, and White self and to find my identity-in-context. Finally, I offer a reclamation of my Mexican mother's life and death using Gloria Anzaldua's notion of ""autohistoria."" I close with further ramifications of the study.

Methods: A cross-sectional 2011 Internet survey collected dyadic data from 275 HIV-negative and 58 HIV-discordant male couples to describe 631 HIV-negative partnered mens' willingness to use PrEP and associated couple-level demographic and behavioral factors with multivariate multilevel modeling. Results: Fifty-three percent were very to extremely likely to use PrEP. Willingness was positively associated with being in a mixed race and behaviorally non-monogamous relationship, and with amyl nitrate use with sex outside the relationship. Willingness was negatively associated with having a college education. Conclusion: Prevention efforts should educate male couples about the potential benefits of PrEP.

Individual characteristics, family dynamics, historical factors, and social and political contexts all influence who we believe ourselves to be. In this chapter, we examine ethnicity as a separate construct from race, although related, along with how it impacts the workforce. Although there are other dimensions of our being that also blend with our race and ethnicity, making up our total being-gender, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, abilities versus disabilities, and religious or spiritual beliefs-ethnicity is generally understood as a ""fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common or national tradition"".

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background/Context: Cuba's education system has been the focus of academic study by researchers on and off the island who frequently cite the comparative success of Cuban students on measures such as the UNESCO math and language assessments. Few studies, however, consider the significance of race within Cuban education generally or the home-school relationship in particular. Indeed, there has been no empirical work made available on these topics for nearly a decade. Significant sociopolitical changes are underway in Cuba, with implications for the role of the state in the cultural life of the nation. Education is a key transmission point between the state and its people, with teachers as frontline cultural workers. Purpose: This article examines the way Cuban teachers address racism in their professional practice, with a specific focus on teacher home visits to address racism with parents/guardians. The author analyzes the relationship between Cuban teachers and the families of students they teach (an under-researched form of teacher practice in an under-researched context). Little is known about teachers reaching and teaching parents directly about issues such as racism. Further, there is limited research on the ways in which understanding of citizenship and professional responsibility impact teachers' work and pedagogy in their interactions with parents. Setting: Havana, Cuba. Participants: All interviewees were teachers from downtown Havana. Twenty-two male and 23 female teachers participated. Fifteen of the teachers were Mestizo (of mixed race), one was Chinese-Cuban, 21 were Afro-Cuban, and eight were White. Survey participants were drawn from across Havana's 15 boroughs. Among respondents, 67.4% were female and 32.6% were male. As far as race, 57.8% identified as Mestizo, 18.9% identified as Afro-Cuban, 22% identified as White, and 1.3% identified as Chinese. Research Design: This is a mixed-method study using qualitative interviews (N = 45 participants), and a quantitative survey (N = 150 respondents). Conclusions/Recommendations: Teachers regularly enter the homes of parents in an effort to promote diversity and to counter perceived racism among parents/guardians. The fact that teachers have the authority and sense of entitlement to do so points to possibilities for a significant retooling of the ecology systems framework. Many teachers undertake this work with parents/guardians just as they would when addressing student academic performance. This race-work is supported by state-generated social capital that, in Cuba, embeds conceptions of race within a larger public context, as opposed to treating race as a private matter to be subjectively and privately understood. As quasi-curriculum, antiracism is something everyone is expected to learn. This suggests that a careful consideration of the way concepts of nation, citizenship, and professional responsibility inform teacher preparation and practice in Cuba may deepen our understanding of teachers' race-work in North American contexts.

Having more than one racial heritage has a direct impact on how these children are seen by others as well as how they understand and encounter the world around them. Parents socialize their children in matters of race and discrimination that can impact their racial identity development, which is a component of their overall identity development. The aim of this study was explore how multiracial children are socialized and the impact of that socialization on racial identity formation from a heuristic perspective. Heuristic inquiry is a facet of phenomenology that seeks to understand the researcher's experience of the phenomenon; therefore, I provided data on my experiences with raising a mixed-race child in a monoracial family. Two other families experiencing the same phenomenon were also interviewed. Themes related to racial profiling, parental perception of the mixed race child's personality, skin tone, level of respect, and parenting were identified through the five-step analysis process recommended by Moustakas for heuristic inquiry, including immersion, incubation, illumination, explication, and creative synthesis. This study highlights relevant aspects in the lives of mixed-race children, how that impacts the way society views mixed-race individuals, and how those individuals encounter the world around them.

This growing shift in our population is known as the ""Biracial Baby Boom"" (Bratter, 2007), however, research is lagging with regard to the lived experience and its relationship to psychological well-being of this significant part of our population. Previous research found that greater malleability of one's racial identity is related to decreased psychological well-being (Sanchez, Shih & Garcia, 2009). However, other research, related to self-concept, suggested that authentic self-complexity, more complex cognitive representations of the self, can serve as a buffer against daily stress (Ryan, LaGuardia & Rawsthorne, 2005). The construct of racial malleability, shifting expressions of racial identity in a given context, has been grounded in self-concept literature supporting the importance of stability in how one sees oneself. Though similar, research on self-complexity reinforces the protective quality of organizing self-knowledge in terms of a greater number of authentic self-aspects. Differences in outcomes for these similar yet related concepts may be due to the representations of racial self-aspects based on the kinds of contextual experiences. Specifically, one's ability to incorporate multiple aspects of identity may be compromised in the face of questioning by others or one's sense of authenticity. Thus, the association between malleable identity and outcomes is dependent on contextual experiences. This study explored the ways in which identity experiences and authenticity influence the relationship between racial malleability and psychological well-being for 149 multiracial adults surveyed via the internet. Psychological well-being was defined by measures of perceived stress and life satisfaction. Findings suggest that racial malleability positively relates to life satisfaction. Additionally, the relationship between racial malleability and perceived stress is moderated by experiences of identity questioning. Regarding authenticity, self-alienation as a measure of authenticity played a significant role in multiracial well-being. Implications for these relationships are discussed regarding therapy and research with multiracial individuals.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Decades of research supports the presence of significant genetic influences on children's internalizing (emotional), externalizing (acting out), and social difficulties, including victimization. Additionally, being victimized has been shown to relate to further behavioral problems. The current study assessed the nature of the gene-environment relationships between the DRD4 gene, peer victimization, and externalizing and internalizing difficulties in 6- to 10-year-old children. 174 children (56 % girls; 88.6 % Caucasian, 3.4 % African American, 8 % mixed race or Mayan) and their parents were administered victimization and problem behavior questionnaires, and DRD4 was genotyped for the children. An interaction between genes (DRD4) and environment (victimization) was significant and supported the differential susceptibility model for verbal victimization and child-reported externalizing behaviors. Children with the DRD4 7-repeat allele were differentially responsive to the verbal victimization environment, such that those experiencing little to no victimization reported significantly lower levels of externalizing behaviors, but if they experienced high amounts of victimization, they reported the highest levels of externalizing behaviors. Thus, consideration of how genes and environment affect children's experiences of victimization prior to adolescence is essential for understanding the trajectory of both externalizing and internalizing behaviors during adolescent development.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This study used structural equation modeling to conduct a first and second order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of a scale developed by McDonald and Moberg (2002) to measure three dimensions of social capital among a diverse group of middle- and upper-middle-class elementary school parents in suburban New York. A structural path model was created which best explains the linkages between race/ethnicity and our new construct ""Total Social Capital."" The CFA confirmed the three very distinct dimensions of social capital: parent-school, parent-parent, and parent-child. Fit indices also suggest the existence of a second order, global Total Social Capital factor comprised of all three dimensions of social capital. We show that Black, Hispanic, and mixed-race family status is associated with significantly diminished Total Social Capital, both directly and indirectly via socioeconomic status. This is one of the few studies to find decreased social capital even among middle- and upper-middle-class minorities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Perceiving the pain of others activates similar neural structures to those involved in the direct experience of pain, including sensory and affective-motivational areas. Empathic responses can be modulated by race, such that stronger neural activation is elicited by the perception of pain in people of the same race compared with another race. In the present study, we aimed to identify when racial bias occurs in the time course of neural empathic responses to pain. We also investigated whether group affiliation could modulate the race effect. Using the minimal group paradigm, we assigned participants to one of two mixed-race teams. We examined event-related potentials from participants when viewing members of their own and the other team receiving painful or non-painful touch. We identified a significant racial bias in early ERP components at N1 over frontal electrodes, where Painful stimuli elicited a greater negative shift relative to Non-Painful stimuli in response to own race faces only. A long latency empathic response was also found at P3, where there was significant differentiation between Painful and Non-Painful stimuli regardless of Race or Group. There was no evidence that empathy-related brain activity was modulated by minimal group manipulation. These results support a model of empathy for pain that consists of early, automatic bias towards own-race empathic responses and a later top-down cognitive evaluation that does not differentiate between races and may ultimately lead to unbiased behaviour.

I interviewed 30 mixed race adults in the United States and United Kingdom about their identity, body work and being asked ""what are you?"" In the first of four empirical chapters I discuss racial identity, analyzing the role of gender, socialization, social interactions, environment, and life course changes. One unique contribution is the recognition of hip hop as a significant factor in mixed race men's identity formation. The next two chapters examine what body work interviewees perform and why. Chapter 4 analyzes hair styling and piercings, both of which were purposely used to influence one's racial appearance. I also discuss tattooing as multiple interviewees described desire for or acquisition of a personally designed tattoo that provides a pictorial representation of her/his mixed race identity. Chapter 5 then analyzes skin color management and other practices that were reported to not be used for racial purposes. In the final empirical chapter, I theorize from my interviewees' experiences being asked ""what are you?"" finding in general that it was felt as a microaggression (Sue at al. 2007) or ""Nigger moment"" (Anderson 2011) when posed from mono-racial people but was welcomed as an opportunity for solidarity when posed from other mixed race people. Moreover, intersectionality played a crucial role in these encounters with women and service workers reporting receiving more questions than men or professionals. My dissertation concludes with a discussion of body work and responses to racial questions as instances of race emerging within social interactional. While only two types of body work were used purposefully to ""do race,"" I argue that the body work practices for which non-racial explanations were offered may also be ""doing race"" yet are unrecognized as such due to white hegemony. Regarding receipt of racial questions, I argue that these accumulated inconsistent reflected appraisals collectively serve as one consistent reflected appraisal of mixed race heritage. As whole, this dissertation interrogates the micro-politics of embodied racialization and advances our understanding of the micro-construction of race.

The purpose of the book is ""to capture the phenomenology of being mixed-race in a compelling way, and in so doing to inspire, engage, and move our readers"". The edited book contains 12 narratives written by self-identified multiracial students: six men and six women, either current students or recent graduates of Dartmouth College. The introduction provides an important context for the 12 narratives. The book concludes rather abruptly with no discussion of how the 12 narratives may inform higher education research and practice.

Using nationally representative data from the 2010 and 2012 America's Barometer survey, the authors examine patterns of self-identification in four countries. National differences in the relation between skin color, socioeconomic status, and race were found. Skin color predicts race closely in Panama but loosely in the Dominican Republic. Moreover, despite the dominant belief that money whitens, the authors discover that status polarizes (Brazil), mestizoizes (Colombia), darkens (Dominican Republic), or has no effect (Panama). The results show that race is both physical and cultural, with country variations in racial schema that reflect specific historical and political trajectories.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This study tested Social Cognitive Career Theory's (SCCT) academic persistent model among engineering students from a longitudinal perspective and examined whether relations among the variables in the model differed between Whites and Latinos/as and between men and women engineering majors. Three hundred fifty engineering student participants (172 Latino/as; 155 Whites; 23 mixed race) who were attending a Hispanic-serving institution in the Southwest completed measures of math/science ACT, college GPA, engineering self-efficacy, engineering goals, and persistence. The academic persistence model within the engineering domain provided an excellent fit to the data. Significant group differences between women and men were found; however, there were no group differences across ethnicity. Implication for further research and interventions based on SCCT's academic persistence model are discussed in relation to academic persistence in engineering for women and Latinos/as.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The Integrative Model for the Study of Developmental Competencies in Minority Children argues that while discrimination and prejudice are normative experiences for ethnic minority children, promoting environments, family factors and adaptive culture may help minority youth develop effective coping strategies to deal with discrimination. Although this model emphasizes the critical role of family, there are relatively few studies on discrimination that include data from both parents and youth. In the current study, we qualitatively investigated themes of teen discrimination experiences and youth/parent responses in a sample (N = 40) of Mexican descent parents (n = 20) and middle school aged (11-15 years old) adolescents (n = 20) who participated in separate youth and parent focus groups. Adolescents indicate that stereotypes are pervasive, as evidenced in media, anti-immigrant comments, and insults from peers. Yet, adolescents expressed few specific strategies to deal with discrimination, and often expressed concern that standing up to discrimination may lead to physical altercation. Parents discussed the pervasiveness of prejudice and ethnic slurs, and specifically identified school as a setting where teens experience discrimination. Parents discussed strategies of teaching children not to use derogatory terms against others, telling them not to engage in fighting, encouraging children to report school incidents to teachers, and trying to prevent criminalization of male youth by talking to them about clothing choices. Mixed race families especially talked about inclusivity, ethnic/racial pride, and sharing family history (immigration, language, racial diversity). The Integrative Model for Developmental Competencies guides our discussion of implications for adolescent well-being and future research.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Little is known about public perspectives of scientific and therapeutic uses of placentas. Gaps in knowledge potentiate ethical and clinical problems regarding collection and applications. As such, this study sought to assess the perspectives of placenta donation of a sample of women. Postpartum women's perspectives on placental donation were assessed at the State University of Campinas in the Centro de Atencao Integral a Saude da Mulher (CAISM) maternity hospital using a cross-sectional survey (n = 384) and semi-structured interviews (n = 12). Surveys were analyzed quantitatively and interviews were analyzed qualitatively using grounded coding; results were compared. The average age of respondents was 27. Fifty-six percent had more than one child, 45% were Caucasian, 38% were mixed-race, 74% identified with a Christian faith, 52% had high school education or higher, 13% regarded the placenta as spiritually important, 72% felt that knowing what happens to the placenta after birth was somewhat or very important, 78% supported the use of the placenta in research and medicine, 59% reported that consent to collect the placenta was very or somewhat important, 78% preferred their doctor to invite donation, and only 7% preferred the researcher to invite donation. Interviews suggested women appreciate being part of research and that receiving information about studies was important to them. Informed by these results, we argue that women support scientific and therapeutic uses of placentas, want to be included in decision making, and desire information about the placenta. Placentas should not be viewed as ""throwaway"" organs that are poised for collection without the involvement and permission of women. Women want to be meaningfully included in research processes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, Academic Profiling: Latinos, Asian Americans, and the Achievement Gap by Gilda L. Ochoa (2013). The book is based on a large-scale interview study in Southern California High School, which serves a significant proportion of both Latino and Asian American students. This book is a valuable and long overdue piece of research on the achievement gap. It goes beyond focusing on the extent of the racial achievement gap and demonstrates how this gap is maintained in schools on a daily basis. The use of student, parent, and staffulty voices throughout the work makes for an engaging read. While there are likely many common themes that will be found across mixed race high schools in the United States, there are also ways in which other types of racial dynamics, both within the school and in the geographic area, are likely to provide a differently nuanced understanding of the processes contributing to the presence of academic achievement disparities. Academic Profiling: Latinos, Asian Americans, and the Achievement Gap will be of particular interest for scholars of education, stratification, inequality, and qualitative methods.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Due to changes in cannabis policies, concerns about cannabis use (CU) in adolescents have increased. The population of nonwhite groups is growing quickly in the United States. We examined perceived CU norms and their association with CU and CU disorder (CUD) for White, Black, Hispanic, Native-American, Asian-American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NH/PI), and mixed-race adolescents. Data were from adolescents (12-17 years) in the 2004-2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (N = 163,837). Substance use and CUD were assessed by computer-assisted, self-interviewing methods. Blacks, Hispanics, Native-Americans, and mixed-race adolescents had greater odds of past-year CU and CUD than Whites. Among past-year cannabis users (CUs), Hispanics and Native-Americans had greater odds of having a CUD than Whites. Asian-Americans had the highest prevalence of perceived parental or close friends' CU disapproval. Native-Americans and mixed-race adolescents had lower odds than Whites of perceiving CU disapproval from parents or close friends. In adjusted analyses, adolescent's disapproval of CU, as well as perceived disapproval by parents or close friends, were associated with a decreased odds of CU in each racial/ethnic group, except for NHs/PIs. Adolescent's disapproval of CU was associated with a decreased odds of CUD among CUs for Whites (personal, parental, and close friends' disapproval), Hispanics (personal, parental, and close friends' disapproval), and mixed-race adolescents (personal, close friends' disapproval). Racial/ethnic differences in adolescent CU prevalence were somewhat consistent with adolescents' reports of CU norm patterns. Longitudinal research on CU health effects should oversample nonwhite adolescents to assure an adequate sample for analysis and reporting.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Over the last two decades, lay and professional interest in Britain's 'mixed-race' population has markedly increased, following dramatic growth in mixing and mixedness. As is often the case with new phenomena, agencies in the sphere of popular culture have stepped in to offer the wider public interpretative representations of this 'new' group. Drawing on challenging concepts, like demographic growth rates and projections, the family 'norm', the ostensible benefits of heterozygosity, and the drawbacks of claimed 'in-betweenness', they have offered us a picture of the 'mixed-race' population that is sometimes at variance with lived experiences or the harder image of statistical reality. Social representation theory is used to explore the limitations of these representations and to offer a number of counter-narratives that are grounded in the evidence base.

If we understand socio-racial identity as a genealogical inheritance, outside of social constructs like the one-drop rule or other cultural adaptations that allow for the suppression of multi-raciality, what race is a person who has an Asian parent and a Black parent? How does the child pick which parent to identify with if, in fact, the child identifies with both parents equally? One might respond to this scenario through the lens of the one drop rule, which suggests that a person is Black if they have any ancestor anywhere in their genealogy that is Black. Mixed race identity, as it has been activated by millennials, the last generation born in the 20th century in the United States, might suggest that the one drop rule is doing the work of an oppressive system in denying the importance of intimate realities in socio-racial identity. Through ethnographic and auto-ethnographic narrative, engagement with critical race and critical mixed race scholarship, and interaction with mixed race millennials, including those I have worked with over the last six years, I argue that now is the time for theorists and interdisciplinary scholars to activate the millennial contexts that are transforming mixed race discourse.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Peer victimization is a common and potentially detrimental experience for many adolescents. However, not all youth who are exposed to peer victimization experience maladaptive outcomes, such as depression. Thus, greater attention to potential moderators of peer victimization is particularly important. The current study examined the potential moderating effect of intrinsic religiosity and religious attendance on the longitudinal association between physical and relational victimization and depressive symptoms. A diverse sample of adolescents (N = 313; Mage = 17.13 years; 54% female; 49% Caucasian, 24% African American, 19% Latino, 8% mixed race/other; 80% Christian religious affiliation) were recruited from a rural, low-income setting. Adolescents completed self-report measures of religious attendance and intrinsic religiosity, and two forms of victimization (i.e., physical and relational) were assessed using sociometric procedures in 11th grade. Depressive symptoms were measured in both 11th and 12th grade. Results suggest that relational victimization is associated prospectively with depressive symptoms only under conditions of adolescents' low intrinsic religiosity. Findings may contribute to efforts aimed at prevention and intervention among adolescents at risk for peer victimization and depression.

We address problems of interaction as affected by the status characteristic race, which often disadvantages black members of work teams. Following the lead of Goar and Sell, we devised mixed-race task groups of women aimed at equalizing influence over the groups' decisions. In baseline groups, white women exerted greater influence than did black women. In experimental groups, we artificially increased the participation of black women, and thereby increased their influence over group decisions. We consider some implications for diversity in natural settings including business organizations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"There are few evaluations of peer-facilitated teenage dating violence prevention programs in the literature. To begin to address this gap, this project assessed the effectiveness of a school-based, peer-facilitated healthy relationships program among academically at-risk students. Two hundred and ninety-one ninth graders of mixed race and gender participated in a five-session healthy relationships program that had been adapted to address concerns of cultural relevance. Findings from analyses of variance showed that program participants made statistically significant improvements from pretest to posttest, across demographics of race and gender. Results support the value of developing culturally responsive curricula and using peer-facilitated programming to address teenage dating violence in school-based healthy relationship programs.

The project centers voice as an aesthetic and political tool and inaugurates a concept of transvocality, encompassing various ways in which the bodies of singers and listeners are ""moved"" in performance. The research suggests that these movements and performative exchanges resignify transgender as a celebratory, desiring and desirable subject position. ""Singing Strange"" also foregrounds trans of color critique, mobilizing voice as a practical and theoretical lens by which to realize more inclusive trans activisms. The dissertation draws from interviews conducted during fifteen months of touring and onsite fieldwork in and around Toronto, Ontario, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Chicago, Illinois, between 2009 and 2013. Ethnographic data include live performances, recordings, videos, social networks, and interviews with artists, voice professionals, producers, audience members, and healthcare providers. The case study on Canadian rock singer Lucas Silveira proffers the first critical synthesis of the literature on transgender vocality vis-a-vis music. Silveira complicates the role of emotion in masculinity in timbral and affective senses; his experiences of immigration, gender, and genre establish the material and political grounds of ""voice"" in the project. A second case study explores the music, composition, and performances of R&B/electro/pop artist Kelly Moe as practices of genderqueer world-making and cyborg vocality. The chapter showcases music's capacity to open spaces for underrepresented modes of embodiment and identity within the already liminal categories of transgender and mixed race. A third case amplifies Joe Stevens' voice and the Americana genre as metonyms for the recently increased visibility of white, middle class, able-bodied trans men. Such visibility, however welcome in many respects, nonetheless risks producing Others who are too Black, Brown, disabled, foreign, lower class, or otherwise strange to ""count"" as trans. At the same time, the chapter productively complicates a discussion of race and class privilege via critical disability studies and activist frames. Ultimately, the project demonstrates that music performance is a critical site in which trans activisms and subjectivities are forged.

Yet, studies of racial stratification generally require the assumption that racial identities are predominantly fixed over one's life course. If one's race can change over time, then trends in racial stratification may reflect changes in group affiliation rather than changes in the groups' relative positions. Because of this, racial reclassification is often studied as a confounding factor hindering the development of reliable measures of social stratification. As a consequence, the statistical study of racial reclassification as an indicator of the dynamics of the social construction of race in a society is relatively underappreciated. This dissertation contributes to the literature on the social construction of race by investigating how Brazilians changed their racial self-identification over their life course between the years of 1940 and 2013. First, the residual method and data from the 1940 to 2010 Brazilian censuses is used to make inferences about the patterns of racial reclassification in this country over these seven decades. Second, longitudinal data from the 2002 to 2013 Brazilian Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego is used to provide a more comprehensive picture of the flows between the five racial categories included in the survey and to estimate patterns of racial reclassification by socioeconomic characteristics, such as education. Overall, the results indicate that, while between 1940 and 1990 there was a growing tendency for Brazilians to identify as a mixed-race population, the period after 1990 was particularly marked by a strong growth in self-identification as ""black"". These trends are discussed in light of the opposing theories of racial harmony and racial conflict that predominated in Brazil over this period. Taken together, this research demonstrates important ways in which the broad historic and geographic scope of the data and methods used in the statistical study of racial reclassification help move forward the debate around the meaning of race in Brazil.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The relation between multiracial identity selection and psychological outcomes related to the self and well-being was explored among minority/White biracials spanning four different mixed-race groups (n = 201): Black/Whites, East Asian/Whites, Latino/Whites, and South Asian/Whites. The mixed-race groups showed considerable variability in their selection of multiracial identity categories and different patterns of identity selection, as well as a higher overall representation of transcendent identity (i.e., identity that challenges traditional notions of race) than reported in previously published studies. Our findings demonstrated that biracial identity selection, especially when differentiating between identities that are socially validated or not socially validated by others, was related to a person's level of multiracial identity integration, identification with Whites, perceived discrimination from Whites and non-Whites, and psychological well-being. Identity selection groups did not significantly differ from each other in levels of self-concept clarity or identification with their non-White racial group. Theoretical implications for extending a multidimensional model to other mixed-race groups and redefining race as a social and cultural construction are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Educational achievement and attainment are associated with health outcomes across the entire life span. The objective of this study was to determine whether racial/ethnic disparities in academic achievement and educational aspirations have changed over time. The study used data from the Minnesota Student Survey (MSS) from 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010. The MSS is administered to adolescents in public secondary schools, charter schools, and tribal schools. Measures of academic achievement and educational aspirations were examined by race/ethnicity, poverty status, and family structure. Chi square tests evaluated differences in the above proportions. The analytic sample included 351,510 adolescents (1998, N = 67,239; 2001, N = 69,177; 2004, N = 71,084; 2007, N = 72,312; and 2010, N = 71,698). Study participants ranged in age from 13 to 19 years (mean = 15.9, SD = 1.6). Most were white (81.7 %), followed by 5.4 % Asian American/Pacific Islander, 4.3 % Black/African American, 2.7 % Hispanic/Latino, 1 % American Indian, and 4.9 % mixed race. Results showed that academic achievement fluctuated amongst all the racial/ethnic groups, but there were significant race/ethnic disparities at every time point. Overall, academic aspirations increased over time among the adolescents. Poverty was associated with poorer academic indicators for white youth, but not consistently for other racial/ethnic groups of youth. Family structure, however, was significantly associated with the educational indicators across all racial and ethnic groups. Despite many efforts to improve educational outcomes, there remain significant disparities in educational achievement and aspirations related to race-ethnicity and social status. Findings have implications for efforts to improve adolescent health at both individual and community levels.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Limited national data document the prevalence of incarceration among transgender women, experiences of victimization while incarcerated, and associations of transgender status with health. Data were from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS), a large convenience sample of transgender adults in the U.S., collected between September 2008 and March 2009. Respondents who indicated a transfeminine gender identity were included in the current study (n = 3,878). Multivariable logistic regression was used to model ever being incarcerated and experiencing victimization while incarcerated as a function of race/ethnicity and health-related indicators. Overall, 19.3% reported having ever been incarcerated. Black and Native American/Alaskan Native transgender women were more likely to report a history of incarceration than White (non-Hispanic) respondents, and those with a history of incarceration were more likely to report negative health-related indicators, including self-reporting as HIV-positive. Among previously incarcerated respondents, 47.0% reported victimization while incarcerated. Black, Latina, and mixed race transgender women were more likely to report experiences of victimization while incarcerated. Transgender women reported disproportionately high rates of incarceration and victimization while incarcerated, as well as associated negative health-related indicators. Interventions and policy changes are needed to support transgender women while incarcerated and upon release.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Objective: We aimed to evaluate the combined effects of HIV and APOE e4 allele(s) on glial metabolite levels, and on known cognitive deficits associated with either condition, across the ages. Methods: One hundred seventy-seven participants, primarily of white and mixed race (97 seronegative subjects: aged 44.7 +/- 1.3 years, 85 [87.6%] men, 28 [28.9%] APOE e41; 80 HIV+ subjects: Aged 47.+/- 6 1.1 years, 73 [91.3%] men, 23 [28.8%] APOE e41), were assessed cross-sectionally for metabolite concentrations using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 4 brain regions and for neuropsychological performance. Results: Frontal white matter myo-inositol was elevated in subjects with HIV across the age span but showed age-dependent increase in seronegative subjects, especially in APOE e41 carriers. In contrast, only seronegative APOE e41 subjects showed elevated myo-inositol in parietal cortex. All APOE e41 subjects had lower total creatine in basal ganglia. While all HIV subjects showed greater cognitive deficits, HIV1 APOE e41 subjects had the poorest executive function, fluency memory, and attention/working memory. Higher myo-inositol levels were associated with poorer fine motor function across all subjects, slower speed of information processing in APOE e41 subjects, and worse fluency in HIV1 APOE e41 subjects. Conclusions: In frontal white matter of subjects with HIV, the persistent elevation and lack of normal age-dependent increase in myo-inositol suggest that persistent glial activation attenuated the typical antagonistic pleiotropic effects of APOE e4 on neuroinflammation. APOE e4 negatively affects energy metabolism in brain regions rich in dopaminergic synapses. The combined effects of HIV infection and APOE e4 may lead to greater cognitive deficits, especially in those with greater neuroinflammation. APOE e4 allele(s) may be a useful genetic marker to identify white and mixed-race HIV subjects at risk for cognitive decline.

Edited Book",Chapter,Textbook/Study Guide,"(from the introduction) Taken together, Section 2 discusses several different kinds of innovators or cheaters-if you will-in our society and the sources of anomie or strain that motivate them. Merton wrote about garden variety criminals and juvenile delinquent. Hagedorn reports on inner-city drug dealers. My connections reading discusses doping among elite athletes, and this introduction describes college students' illicit use of prescribed stimulants to achieve their academic goals. While it is true that all of us, despite our backgrounds, are susceptible to some level of anomie and strain, it is also true that there are racial and class patterns to deviant innovations. Merton studied the poor. Hagedorn focused on disadvantaged blacks. Doping in professional sports is a mixed-race, privileged group, while the college students popping Adderall to pass their exams are largely middle class and white. One question to consider then is if patterns in deviant innovation are related to cultural differences between race and ethnic groups or to economic status and social class position? Perhaps styles of innovation are simply a combination of a variety of social dimensions, including race, ethnicity, class, age, and gender. If so, then another important question to ask is, which types of cheating, and by whom, are tolerated in our society and which are not? How would you explain the differences? Which types of innovation and groups would you explain with the more macrolevel anomie theory or the more microlevel general strain theory? Would you combine them? I hope the readings in this section help you reach some conclusions.

The purpose was to assess how social organization contributes to the racial distribution of mental health. The study defined mental health as a multi-dimensional construct that includes negative, positive, and subjective facets. The empirical analysis compared East Asians, South Asians, Blacks, Aboriginals, and mixed race persons to Whites on major depression, psychological distress, psychological well-being, and self-rated mental health. Separate comparisons were made for women and men because the relationship between race and mental health could be conditional on gender. Using individual-level data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 1.2 and aggregate data from the 2001 Canadian Census, the study hypothesized that racial differences in mental health could reflect differences in stress exposure, socioeconomic status, social embeddedness, and neighborhood environment. The main assumption was that higher stress exposure, economic hardship, social isolation, and neighborhood disadvantage could compromise the mental health of racial minorities. The study also examined whether social support and coping behaviors protected racial minorities from these health-damaging effects. The findings do not present a straightforward or a consistent set of conclusions. Although there is a good rational to believe that racial minorities should have worse mental health than Whites, this is not always or even mostly the case. Only Aboriginal women have a consistent disadvantage. For the most part, racial minorities have similar mental health as Whites, and even have an advantage in a few instances. Since the analysis covered the negative, positive, and subjective dimensions of mental health, it provides robust evidence to support this conclusion. However, the findings also demonstrate that low socioeconomic status and insufficient social resources can indeed have health-damaging effects. These factors explain some of the observed disadvantages in mental health that racial minorities experience or suppress an advantage among them.

The book is composed of 11 chapters organized around two levels of research: (1) societies with established populations of mixed descent, and (2) societies with newer populations of mixed descent. The chapters offer the reader a rich narrative that explores the complex process of the social construction of concepts that describe populations around the world that are mixed race or mixed descent or populations that have mixed identities. The book as a whole and many of the chapters do make a significant contribution to the general understanding of mixed populations around the world.

Data from a multiple cohort longitudinal study, conducted in Mobile, Alabama between 1998 and 2011, were used to examine the impact of Barack Obama's nomination and presidency on racial/ethnic identification. The results show that significantly more adolescents changed their self-reported racial/ethnic identification from White or Mixed-Race to Black or Mixed Race after the election than before.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Objective: We use nationally representative survey experiments to assess public opinion about how President Obama should have identified himself racially on the 2010 Census. Methods: Respondents were randomly assigned to three conditions-a control, a treatment that described the president's biracial ancestry, and a treatment that combined the biracial ancestry information with a statement that Obama had in fact classified himself as black only. All respondents were then asked how they felt Obama should have filled out his Census form. Results. A clear majority of Americans in all experimental conditions said that Obama should have identified himself as both black and white. Conclusion: There appears to be suggesting robust acceptance of official multiracial identification despite the cultural and legal legacy of the ""one drop of blood"" rule in official U.S. race categorization. A subsequent survey experiment found that a convenience sample of Americans support multiracial identification for mixed-race individuals generally and not only for the president.

Despite some social recognition of Black-White persons as multiracial, racial microaggressions persist in daily life. Subtle racist acts (Sue, Capodilupo, Torino, Bucceri, Holder, Nadal, & Esquilin, 2007b) negatively impact multiracial identity development. Since 2007, studies have increasingly focused on the impact of racial microaggressions on particular monoracial ethnic groups. Johnston and Nadal (2010) delineated general racial microaggressions for multiracial people. This project examines the effects of racial microaggressions on the multiracial identity development of 11 part-Black multiracial university students, including the concerns and challenges they face in familial, academic, and social racial identity formation. Data were analyzed through a typological analysis and Racial and Multiracial Microaggressions typologies (Johnston & Nadal, 2010; Sue et al., 2007b). Three themes arose: (a) the external societal pressure for the multiracial person to identify monoracially; (b) the internalized struggle within the mixed-race person to create a cohesive self-identity; and (c) the assertion of a multiracial identity. Participants experienced Racial Microaggressions (Sue, 2010a; Sue et al., 2007b), Multiracial Microaggressions (Johnston & Nadal, 2010), and Monoracial Stereotypes (Nadal, Wong, Griffin, Sriken, Vargas, Wideman, & Kolawole, 2011). Implications included encouraging a multiracial identity, educating the school community, and eliminating racial microaggressions and stereotypes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"In this historical period of globalization, new constructions of identity as well as new clinical questions arise. They concern cultural mixing (of birth), identity mixing (due to acculturation and to social, intellectual or spiritual changes). They also concern the different figures of neoparentality (family reconstructions after divorces and separations, homo-parentality, single parentality), as well as adoptions, medically attended procreations, and transidentities (transsexuals, transgenders). The author shows why and how the clinic of crossbreedings constitutes a new paradigm that helps to understand other new constructions of identities. In such cases, psychotherapy consists in accompanying the vicissitudes of a metamorphosis of identity. Finally, crossbreedings play also an interesting political role: they are interlinkers between heterogeneous worlds.

Specifically, this study examined whether school neighborhood socioeconomic status (SNSES) and school climate were associated with student reports of bullying, victimization, and others being bullied at school. The interaction between SNSES and school climate was also assessed. The sample included 9,603 students from 26 schools (49.7% were female and 50.1% self-identified as White, 15.7% as Latino, 12.3% as Mixed race/ethnicity, 7.1% as Black, 6.5% as Asian, 2.7% as Middle Eastern and 5.4% as Other). Student grade levels ranged from 3 to 12. Bullying and school climate were assessed via student report. SNSES was assessed via 2000 U.S. Census data. Multilevel linear modeling was used to examine the study hypotheses. Results revealed that negative school climate and negative SNSES were associated with increased student reports of bullying, victimization, and others being bullied. Students in high SNSES schools reported less victimization at positive levels of school climate. There was little difference in student reported victimization across different levels of school climate among students in low SNSES schools. Implications for future research are discussed.

A total of N = 311 HIV + men (18- 50 years) receiving HIV care at one of six public primary care clinics in Rio de Janeiro between 2008-2009 were surveyed. We used descriptive statistics, and multivariate logistic regression to identify factors associated with communication about childbearing with an HIV provider. HIV + male patients (mean age = 42.7 years, 57% mixed race; 23% bisexual, 51% married/committed partner, 61% with at least one biological child, 77% on ART) reported accepting attitudes of HIV and childbearing (51%), the desire (39%), and/or intention (19%) to have a future child, and reported communication with the HIV provider (14%) or their primary partner (28%) about having children. There were no significant differences between the responses of HIV + heterosexual and bisexual men on the above outcomes. Men who discussed childbearing with their HIV provider were more likely to have accepting attitudes about HIV and childbearing [AOR 2.8, 95%CI (1.2-6.4), p = 0.014], and intend to have a child [AOR 2.6, 95% CI (1.2-5.6), p = 0.018], but less likely to have discussed this topic with their partner [AOR 0.32 (0.15-0.68), p = 0.003]. Among men reporting communication, 40% (17/42) reported advice against having a child. An unmet need for collaborative, nonjudgmental, and provider-initiated communication about childbearing goals exists for HIV + men in clinical care.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"There are concerns over nonmedical use of prescription stimulants among youths, but little is known about the extent of use among young Asian-Americans, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs), and mixed-race individuals-the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population. We examined prevalences and correlates of nonmedical stimulant use (NMSU) and disorder (StiUD) for these underrecognized groups. Whites were included as a comparison. Data were from young individuals aged 12-34 years in the 2005-2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. We used logistic regression to estimate odds of past-year NMSU status. Significant yearly increases in lifetime NMSU prevalence were noted in Whites only. NHs/PIs (lifetime 7.33%, past-year 2.72%) and mixed-race individuals (10.20%, 2.82%) did not differ from Whites in NMSU prevalence (11.68%, 3.15%). Asian-Americans (lifetime 3.83%, past-year 0.90%) had lower prevalences than Whites. In each racial/ethnic group, ""Methamphetamine/Desoxyn/Methedrine or Ritalin"" was more commonly used than other stimulant groups; ""got them from a friend/relative for free"" and ""bought them from a friends/relative"" were among the most common sources. Females had greater odds than males of NMSU (among White, NH/PI, mixed-race individuals) and StiUD (among mixed-race individuals). Young adults (aged 18-25) had elevated odds of NMSU (White, NH/PI); adolescents had elevated odds of StiUD (White, mixed-race). Other substance use (especially marijuana, other prescription drugs) increased odds of NMSU and StiUD. NHs/PIs and mixed-race individuals were as likely as Whites to misuse stimulants. Research is needed to delineate health consequences of NMSU and inform prevention efforts for these understudied, rapidly-growing populations.

For this study, racial identity development is the process by which one selects or identifies his/her racial category. Three research questions are explored: (1) How do black-white interracial couples assist their children with developing their racial identities? (2) How do children born to black-white parents develop their racial identities? (3) What are some of the challenges faced by black-white mixed-race children? This study included 36 participants: 12 biracial children who were raised by their biological parents and 12 black-white interracial couples who conceived a child together. In-depth interviews were conducted to collect data about how the parents assisted the children with developing their racial identity, how the children developed their racial identity, and what challenges are encountered by these children. The data collected for this study provide answers to all of the three research questions. The parent participants used four strategies to assist their children with their racial identity development: educating them about their culture, the ""one drop rule"", using their race to benefit them, and ""see no race and hear no race."" The adult children in this study chose either black or biracial as their racial identities because of their experiences, but none of them chose white as their racial identity. The adult children participants also reported challenges they experienced, including being rejected by family members, the object of prejudiced in school, and being made to feel invisible.

Results: during the study period, 307 cases of AIDS were reported among people 50 years of age or oven There was a predominance of males (205/66, 8%), mixed race, and low education levels. The municipalities with populations above 100 thousand inhabitants reported 58.5% of the cases. There was a progressive increase in cases among women; an increasing trend in the incidence (positive linear correlation); and an advance in the geographical spread of the disease, with expansion to the coastal region and to the interior of the state, reaching municipalities with populations below 30 thousand inhabitants. In some locations the risk of disease was 100 times greater than the relative risk for the state. Conclusion: aging, with the feminization and interiorization of the epidemic in adults 50 years of age and over, confirms the need for the induction of affirmative policies targeted toward this age group.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, According to Our Hearts: Rhinelander V. Rhinelander and the Law of the Multiracial Family by Angela Onwuachi-Willig (2013). Angela Onwuachi-Willig has written a compelling book about the significance that the Rhinelander v. Rhinelander annulment case has for modern day mixed-race families. It reads like two books in one, which if anything, allows it to bridge the stories of mixedrace families through time. Drawing upon evidence from the Rhinelander trial and other publicity regarding the case, she explains in part one, the pressures the parties were put through when they married across the color line. Ounwuachi-Willig offers an important discussion of modern anti-discrimination law in the housing and employment contexts, as she explains how each body of doctrine impacts where mixedrace families might live, and whether they might provide for their families. Yet, each type of anti-discrimination law has limitations in their ability to protect rights.

Initial processing of targets in terms of visually salient social categories is often characterized as inevitable. In the current study, we investigated the influence of processing goals on the representation of race in the visual processing stream. Participants were assigned to one of two mixed-race teams and categorized faces according to their group membership or skin color. To assess neural representations of race, we employed multivariate pattern analysis to examined neural activity related to the presentation of Black and White faces. As predicted, patterns of neural activity within the early visual cortex and fusiform gyri (FG) could decode the race of face stimuli above chance and were moderated by processing goals. Race decoding in early visual cortex was above chance in both categorization tasks and below chance in a prefrontal control region. More importantly, race decoding was greater in the FG during the group membership vs skin color categorization task. The results suggest that, ironically, explicit racial categorization can diminish the representation of race in the FG. These findings suggest that representations of race are dynamic, reflecting current processing goals.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Presents a study which aims to examine the level of interactions which occurs between biracial students and others on the college campus and recommendations that biracial students offer for creating a welcoming inclusive college environment for biracial students. This exploratory study describes the level of interaction among mono-racial and bi/multiracial students on a large campus. Additionally, this study sought the input of bi/multiracial students on how colleges and universities can create a welcoming environment for this population. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are offered: 1. Colleges and universities must take definitive steps to provide supportive services and opportunities for bi/multiracial students including the creation of student organizations and activities for those who would benefit from these. 2. Recognition must be given to the fact that all biracial students do not hold the same attitudes and opinions related to their mixed race heritage, when making decisions about programming for biracial students. 3. Universities must provide opportunities to increase awareness and understanding of the biracial population among faculty, students, and staff through professional development workshops, trainings, college courses, and opportunities for open dialogues. 4. Steps must be taken to reduce the invisibility of multiracial people in the curriculum. 5. Universities must develop creative ways to increase the number of students who are exposed to courses on diversity and race relations.

The authors begin by briefly summarizing the history of the Canadian state-sponsored multiculturalism project. The authors also provide some general facts and figures about racial mixing in Canada before offering examples of the ways that some mixed-race Canadians understand multiculturalism as an ideology, policy, and demographic reality. More specifically, the authors suggest that mixed racialized identities can be superficially celebrated as living proof of the success of multiculturalism and in turn, a supposedly inclusive Canada. Yet, at the same time, mixed-race people continue to be racialized into categories of non-Whiteness and positioned outside of the nation-state. Mixed-race people play a crucial role because of the way they are positioned as key stakeholders in the success of multicultural policy.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) This chapter discusses mixed-race in the decennial UK census and whether the approaches sustainable in the age of globalization and super-diversity. Multiethnic states such as Britain face various challenges in the classification and enumeration of ethnic minority, populations in the future due to two main demographic changes. First, in the new global migration, many of the new-migrant groups have no link historically or culturally to Britain's colonial past, but comprise what Kymlicka calls ""polyethnic minorities."" Second, a significant growth in mixed partnerships and people, and their increasingly diverse modes of identification, poses key questions about the validity and reliability of official classifications. Understandings of ""race"" and the significance of ethnic and racial difference are not only changeable across time, but are also sensitive to specific contexts and localities. Understandings of ""race"" and ""mixed race"" are moving targets, and thus there is always a potential disjuncture between ordinary understandings and practices ""on the ground,"" and official measures of such complex phenomena. Where there is a need for data on the ethnic diversity of the population, new forms of data collection are needed. At a population group level, multiticking probably offers the best opportunity, in spite of concerns about data quality and response stability. However, ""origins-based 'groupness'"" may best be captured by an ancestry or ethnic origins question of the type that has been asked in the US and Canadian censuses.

The authors have tried to lay out the background for thinking about race and mixed race in Germany. Race in Germany is a tricky business, and so is racial mixedness. For many Germans, perhaps, guilt and shame about race are almost as disabling as straightforward racism. Perhaps the fear of being labeled ""racist"" prevents White Germans from actually confronting their own racism and coming to terms with it.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) This chapter examines the history of multiracial American Japanese who grew up in Okinawa and the US during the post-World War II period through the 1970s. The author contextualize their lives historically and document them with oral history interviews focusing on people who grew up in Okinawa. Their transnational lives provide insight on the human experience of multiraciality. The reason for focusing on Okinawa is twofold: the first because of Okinawa's status as a repeatedly colonized space, by Japan in 1879, and later by the US from 1945 to 1972; and secondly on the basis as a place where a ""third space"" hybrid culture exists for mixed-race people as a result of the long term US military presence."" It is important to study this age group for several reasons. First, many of them have a more concrete sense of their own identity than people who are in their teens or twenties. Second, in the academic literature on multiracial people following World War II, their voices are largely absent while the focus is on their parents, caretakers, or adoptive parents. Third, beginning with occupied Japan as a birthplace for mixed people who embody a third culture in a semi-colonized space, and later looking at this group as American immigrants, the research offers new openings for discussion about the current models of racial formation of mixed and marginalized people and how race is reinforced historically across borders.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) In this chapter, the authors consider the ways in which mixed-race identities are constructed in Australia and New Zealand, both relatively new nation states with histories as British settler societies. Australia and New Zealand have experienced little debate in the public sphere about mixed race and minimal impact from international discussion on the subject. Even media coverage of Barack Obama as mixed race at the time of his election did not trigger a conversation about racial terminology. Likewise when Australia's former prime minister John Howard commented that he would prefer a multiracial policy rather than a multicultural one, the comment fell into a void. The issues that have claimed most prominence in relation to race in both Australia and New Zealand have been the effects of migrant intake and the interaction between colonizers, other immigrants, and indigenous peoples. Australia and New Zealand are relatively young countries, built around a model of the nation-state as it emerged in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This model implies close links between ethno-racial and political identity, and as such fits uncomfortably within settler societies, which have generally grown through constant migration of people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds, often resulting in mixed offspring. Neither Australia nor New Zealand has formally named mixed race populations, in the way that Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, colonial India, and some other countries have. Race is rarely an explicit focus of current policies in Australia and New Zealand, and neither country offers a color option in their census. This chapter uses several examples to illustrate the complexities of dealing with mixed race in contexts.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) This chapter examines the experiences of mixed people based on more than 40 in-depth, open-ended interviews conducted in Kazakhstan with ethnically mixed individuals, some of whom came of age in the Soviet era and others since 1991. The interviews have included mixed people in a variety of combinations-Russian Kazakh, Kazakh Tatar, Russian Korean, Armenian Ukrainian, Russian Azerbaijani, Russian Ingush, and others. Of the various respondents, only people of mixed Central Asian/European background would be considered mixed race in US terms. However, ft is important to stress that this is not the main way ""Eurasians"" are understood in Kazakhstan, where views of the fault lines within the population differ from those in the United States. While there is a recognition that one can often distinguish Kazakhs from Russians visually, the broader category ""Asian"" in Kazakhstan is nevertheless primarily defined in religious, linguistic, cultural, and geographic, not racial, terms. Kazakhs, Tajiks, Tatars, Turkmens, Azerbaijanis-all are ""Asians"" because they are Muslims, speak Turkic or Persianate languages, and hail from the Soviet ""East,"" not primarily because of their physical features.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) This chapter discusses gender, identity, and ""race mixing"" in the Trinidad and Tobago nation. The tension between these two strands of identity formation has been central to notions of citizenship in Trinidad and Tobago, although it is not normally discussed in these terms. Interestingly, purist notions of Africanness are also incompatible with the hegemonic hybrid national identity. Still today many people have difficulty in identifying themselves as African-a source of constant disappointment to Afrocentric groups and individuals. The public creole mainstream, therefore, is perceived as a hybrid space, a place where prior ""pure"" identities become mixed. But it is also a place, possibly due to its identification with ""Blackness,"" which is seen as impure, vulgar, immoral, sexual, and masculine. The author clearly demonstrates in this chapter that the situation of mixed-race people today in various countries has a great deal to do with the dominant colonial influence. While various nations share common features, they also demonstrate unique trajectories and configurations of mixedness, depending, for example, on the former colonial power and the cultural heritage of those who trace their lineage to it. This is evident even within the circum-Caribbean region, as can be seen from the chapter in this book on Mexico. Contemporary forces of globalization are currently stirring up the cultural categories to a significant degree, but it does not override them.

Edited Book",,,"(from the cover) Global Mixed Race examines the contemporary experiences of people of mixed descent in nations around the world, moving beyond U.S. borders to explore the dynamics of racial mixing and multiple descent in Zambia, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Okinawa, Australia, and New Zealand. In particular, the volume's editors and contributors ask: how have new global flows of ideas, goods, and people affected the lives and social placements of people of mixed descent? Chapters address the ways mixed-race individuals defy, bolster, speak, and live racial categorization, paying attention to the ways that these experiences help us think through how we see and engage with social differences. The contributors also highlight how mixed-race people can sometimes be used as emblems of multiculturalism, and how these identities are commodified within global capitalism while still considered by some as not pure or inauthentic. A strikingly original collection. Global Mixed Race carefully and comprehensively considers the many different meanings of racial mixedness.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, Articulate While Black: Barack Obama, Language, and Race in the US by H. Samy Alim and G. Smitherman (2012). In the present book, Alim and Smitherman continue to stay true to the language game by decoding the ""racially coded meanings of articulate and how they function to reproduce racist ideologies and, more importantly, racial inequalities"". Using a critical linguistics approach, the authors look at patterns of speech, analyze the syntax of White and Black discourse, and observe how the regular and patterned use of adjectives accompanying articulate indicate the racist subtext of what on the surface may appear to be praise, but what smacks of White racist paternalism, particularly when used by White speakers towards speakers of color. The chapters provide the larger ongoing social, historical, and political processes contributing to the racially coded meanings of articulate. The book is just as much about Obama's walking the line of linguistic versatility and subsequent ascent to the presidency as it is about America's attitude towards African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and African American culture. The book outline the contours of Obama's rhetorical style: his blending of the sacred and the profane and his ability to analyze his mixed-race audience and select ""a familiar cultural touchstone"" such as the jeremiad, which speaks to Americans' ""shared values embodied in the American Dream"".

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"When the economy declines, racial minorities are hit the hardest. Although existing explanations for this effect focus on institutional causes, recent psychological findings suggest that scarcity may also alter perceptions of race in ways that exacerbate discrimination. We tested the hypothesis that economic resource scarcity causes decision makers to perceive African Americans as ""Blacker"" and that this visual distortion elicits disparities in the allocation of resources. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that scarcity altered perceptions of race, lowering subjects' psychophysical threshold for seeing a mixed-race face as ""Black"" as opposed to ""White."" In studies 3 and 4, scarcity led subjects to visualize African American faces as darker and more ""stereotypically Black,"" compared with a control condition. When presented to naive subjects, face representations produced under scarcity elicited smaller allocations than control-condition representations. Together, these findings introduce a novel perceptual account for the proliferation of racial disparities under economic scarcity.

Indian maps functioned as visual aids to distribute land for agriculture, ranching, subsistence farming, and mining, they served as legal titles to property, and they participated in large-scale royal projects including aqueducts and assessments of human and natural resources. Map production is examined from four distinct vantage points including social networks, materials and technology, authentication, and reproduction. In each case, maestros pintores-native master painters--collaborated with a host of individuals including Spanish officials, scribes, merchants, ranchers, farmers, town councils, caciques and lesser lords, and legal professionals to visually describe the region's geographical environment. Indigenous mapping practices fostered the development of a new epistemology that combined European and Mesoamerican worldviews to negotiate the allocation of natural resources among the region's Spanish, Amerindian, and mixed-race communities. This work stresses the role of Indian painters in the formation of early modern empires highlighting the way mapmakers challenged Spanish ideals of visual representation instead re-envisioning spatial relations according to local and regional concerns.

By contrasting the lives and ideas of two mixed-race individuals, one born in Calcutta and the other in Hawaii, this article examines cosmopolitanism, racial formation and the promise of the 'post-racial'. A 'Eurasian' intellectual born in Calcutta in 1904, Dover developed a coloured cosmopolitanism that mirrors in revealing ways Obama's approach to race. Both men embraced blackness while transcending the boundaries of race and nation. Dover and Obama developed a conception of race as freedom-not freedom from race or of a particular race, but the freedom to embrace race without sacrificing other affiliations.

The 2010 census indicated that biracial people are growing at a rate 26 times faster than other racial groups. This rapid increase in biracial individuals necessitates greater understanding of the growing needs of this group. The purpose of this qualitative research study is to identify the effects of self-image on young biracial children ages 6- and 7-years-old. This is a descriptive study for the purpose of gathering information through semi-structured, open-ended interview questions presented to 10 biracial children. The criteria for the study included biracial children ages 6- and 7-years-old, whose parents were African-American and Caucasian, and living in an intact family. Interviews were conducted with the support of picture cards to assist the young participants with ease and accuracy of information. Information provided by this study indicated relevant data and finding of the experiences of biracial children in relationship to self-identity, family, and peers. Findings indicated a phenomenon occurs within this age group that affects how they view themselves. Race matters at a much earlier age and in a more significant manner than previously thought. Much has been written regarding self-identity of biracial individuals with the most recent information involving adolescent development. The current study indicated that the effects of identity affect the biracial child much earlier than adolescence.

Because current research combines all participants of multiethnic and multiracial identities into one ""mixed race"" category, the research fails to capture the unique psychological differences within this ""catch-all"" category. With limited research investigating group differences among multiracial/multiethnic individuals, it is unclear how majority-minority (e.g., Caucasian and African American) or dual minority (e.g., African American and Mexican American) identities differ. The aim of this study was to examine 1) whether dual minority identities reported more race-related events than their majority-minority peers and 2) whether dual minority identities reported greater strength of ethnic identity compared to their majority-minority peers. Data was collected using the Race-Related Events Scale (RES), the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), and a demographic form among San Francisco Bay Area college students (n=112). The two groups significantly differed on RES scores but not MEIM scores. Dual minority identities reported higher mean scores of race-related events compared to majority-minority identities. Additional analyses found the dual minority group was significantly different on the RES and MEIM compared to Caucasians. However, majority-minority group did not differ from the Caucasian group. These findings are consistent with most research; however research investigating intragroup differences is limited.

This book is one of those scholarly interventions that takes your breath away. Complex, razor sharp and beautifully written, it engages with several fields: multiraciality and 'mixed race', diaspora, coloniality, racism and nationalism, sexuality, gender and disability. From the very first pages of the book we are made aware of the complex and often contradictory interrelations of past and present; celebration and forgetting; figurations and fleshy bodies; and location and displacement. The author does so beautifully by constantly moving between the interviewees' voices and those of feminist and queer-of colour scholars, where the former are never a pre-theorised raw material for a violent scholarly dissection.

Scientific proof of this relationship allowed scientists, policymakers, and popular media to posit European and American settler colonialism in the Pacific as a peaceful and natural fulfillment of a biological destiny. Understanding knowledge as an important agent of settler colonial possession-in the political as well as supernatural, haunting connotations of that word- this project seeks to understand how Polynesians (with a particular focus on Native Hawaiians) have been bodily ""possessed,"" along with the political and economic possession of their lands. Thus, the project traces a logic of ""possession through whiteness"" in which Polynesians were once, and under the salutary influence of settler colonialism, will again be white. The project's analysis coheres around four figures of the ""almost white"" Polynesian race: the ancestrally white Polynesian of ethnology and Aryanism (1830s-1870s), the Part-Hawaiian of physical anthropology and eugenics (1910s-1920s), the mixed-race ""Hawaiian girl"" of sociology (1930s-1940s), and the mixed-race, soon-to-be white (again) Polynesian of genetics, whose full acceptance in Hawai`i seemed to provide a model of racial harmony to the world (1950s). Rather than attempting to uncover ""racist"" scientific practices, the project reveals how historical scientific literature produced knowledge about the Polynesian race that remains important in how Native Hawaiians are recognized (and misrecognized) in contemporary scientific, legal and cultural spheres. In addition to the historical analysis, the project also examines contemporary Native Hawaiian responses to the logic of possession through whiteness. These include regenerative actions that radically displace whiteness, such as contemporary relationship building between Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders. At the same time, other regenerative actions attempt to reproduce Native Hawaiian-ness with a standard of racial purity modeled on whiteness, including legal fights waged over blood quantum legislation. Overall, the project provides a scientific genealogy as to how Polynesians have been recognized as ""almost white,"" and questions under what conditions this possessive recognition can be refused.

However, biracial exposure may not lead to positive intergroup perceptions for Whites who are highly racially identified and thus motivated to preserve the social distance between racial groups. We exposed Whites to racially ambiguous Asian/White biracial faces and measured the perceived similarity between Asians and Whites. We found that exposure to racially ambiguous, biracial-labeled targets may improve perceptions of intergroup similarity, but only for Whites who are less racially identified.

Though literature on race and the U.S. census often stresses the causal influence of social mobilization, this analysis reveals that the common explanations for the development of racial classifications such as interest group mobilization, demography and civil rights legislation are not viable in comparative context. To explore and explain how the racial state sees, this thesis conceptualizes race as a system of power relations and develops a framework of the schematic state, which operates concurrently as both an actor responsible for putting the underlying organizational pattern of race into place, solidifying a particular set of racial meanings, and implementing a scheme for the racial configuration of society, and an arena in which policy alternatives are contested and where the state itself participates among other actors. This characterization demonstrates that the schematizing impetus of the census is not an exemplar of a dichotomous relationship between an all-powerful state and powerless racial subjects; instead, the power and meaning of race exist well beyond the control of the fragmented and sometimes contradictory schematic state, from the transnational realm to the level of the group or individual. Contrary to the majority of the literature on race, this thesis demonstrates that state institutions do not act for purely domestic reasons; rather, institutions mediate between national nuances and transnational ideas about race that exist in excess of national boundaries. Thus, while the decision to count mixed-race can be explained by a crystallization of transnational ideational trends that are mediated by national politics, the domestic arena of policy making - or the policy network itself - emerges as a key factor that determines the method of multiracial enumeration. However, these domestic political and policy outcomes are not contained by borders. Once a policy is in place, it has the potential to reinforce domestic policy and contribute to the global discourse of race itself - and in its travels among these levels of abstraction, race transforms.

In particular, we sought to understand the processes by which Whites evaluate Black who belong to their ingroup more positively than other Blacks. Across three studies, we explored two possibilities. One possibility is that, as individuals are generally motivated to evaluate their ingroup positively, all members of a mixed-race ingroup, Whites and Blacks, will be evaluated positively simply on account of shared team membership. Another possibility is that favorable evaluations of Black novel ingroup members are accounted for by differential exposure to, and familiarity with these particular targets. In, Studies 1 and 2, we modified Van Bavel and Cunningham's (2009) novel mixed-race paradigm to test between these two possibilities. Study 3 provided a more direct test of the hypothesis that frequent exposure to Black exemplars improves their evaluation. Taken together our data suggest that neither shared team membership, nor exposure, sufficiently explains increase favorability towards Blacks on an implicit measure of bias.

Conscious risk was estimated to be practiced by 4.8% of HIV-negative MSM and 15.7% of HIV-positive MSM over a six-month period (p < 0.01). Among HIV-negative MSM, episodes of conscious risk were estimated to be more frequent among individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 (compared to those 55 years of age or older), among African Americans and Whites (compared to Latinos and Asians), individuals earning less than 10,000 dollars per year (compared to those earning 50,000 and 70,000 dollars per year), and among users of methamphetamine, downers, pain killers, and amyl nitrate (poppers). Among HIV-positive MSM, episodes of conscious risk were more frequent among Whites and Asians (compared to those of ""other"" races, i.e., those of mixed race, or those who did not exclusively self-report as White, Black, Latino, or Asian), those with full-time employment (as opposed to those with part-time employment), those earning between 30,000 and 50,000 dollars per year or 70,000 dollars per year or greater (compared to those earning under 10,000 dollars per year), and recent users of poppers. Conscious risk was more frequently reported in partnerships with large age gaps and in main partnerships (as opposed to casual or exchange partnerships).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The racial/ethnic composition of the US population is shifting, with the nonwhite population growing faster than whites. We examined cannabis use disorder (CUD) prevalences and correlates in seven racial/ethnic groups. We included cannabis use (CU) prevalence as a comparison. Data were from the 2005-2011 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (N = 394,400). Substance use among respondents aged >12 years was assessed by computer-assisted, self-interviewing methods. The following were included as control variables: age, sex, family income, government assistance, county type, residential stability, major depressive episode history, arrest history, nicotine dependence, alcohol disorder, and survey year. Past-year CU prevalence increased significantly from 10.45% in 2005 to 11.41-11.54% during 2009-2011. Compared with whites, mixed-race individuals had higher odds of CU; Asian Americans and Hispanics had lower odds of CU. There were no significant yearly changes in CUD prevalence in the sample during 2005-2011 (1.58-1.73%). Compared with whites, individuals who were mixed-race, black, and Native American had higher odds of CUD; Asian Americans had lower odds. In aggregate, 15.35% of past-year cannabis users met criteria for a CUD in the 12-month period. Past-year cannabis users who were black, Native American, Hispanic, or Asian American had higher odds of CUD than white users. In each racial/ethnic group, adolescent cannabis users generally showed greater odds of CUD than adult users. Behavioral health indicators (major depressive episode, arrest history, nicotine dependence, alcohol disorder) were associated with CU and CUD. In conclusion, CUD disproportionally affects nonwhite groups and youth.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Purpose: South African adolescents have high HIV risk, yet few prevention interventions are effective. Parents play a pivotal role in youths' healthy sexual development and may be at risk themselves. We tested whether Let's Talk!, a worksite-based parenting program, improves parent-child communication about HIV and sexual health and parent condom use self-efficacy and behavior. Methods: We culturally adapted Let's Talk! in two languages, drawing on formative research and community stakeholder input. We then conducted a small randomized test at a large public worksite in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention consisted of 5 weekly 2-hour group sessions for parents of youth aged 11-15. Sixty-six parents (64% female) and their 64 adolescents (41% female) completed surveys before and 1-2 weeks post-intervention; surveys assessed comfort with talking about sex, communication about 16 HIV- and sex-related topics, and parents' condom use self-efficacy and behavior. Thirty-four Black African (Xhosa language) and 32 coloured (mixed-race; Afrikaans language) parent-child dyads participated. Parents were randomized to intervention (n = 34) and control (n = 32) groups; randomization was stratified by language. Results: Multivariate regressions indicated that the intervention significantly increased parents' comfort with talking to their adolescent about sex, b(SE) = .98(.39), p = .02, and the number of sex-and HIV-related topics discussed with their adolescent, b(SE) = 3.26(1.12), p = .005. Compared with control parents, intervention parents were more likely to discuss new sex- and HIV-related topics not discussed before the intervention, b(SE) = 2.85(.80), p <.001. The intervention significantly increased parents' self-efficacy for condom use, b(SE) = .60(.21), p = .007. Conclusions: Let's Talk! holds promise for improving parent-child communication, a critical first step in preventing HIV among youth.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Little is known about behavioral healthcare needs of Asian Americans (AAs), Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs), and mixed-race people (MRs)dthe fastest growing segments of the U.S. population. We examined substance use disorder (SUD) prevalences and comorbidities among AAs, NHs/PIs, and MRs (N = 4572) in a behavioral health electronic health record database. DSM-IV diagnoses among patients aged 1-90 years who accessed behavioral healthcare from 11 sites were systematically captured: SUD, anxiety, mood, personality, adjustment, childhood-onset, cognitive/dementia, dissociative, eating, factitious, impulse-control, psychotic/schizophrenic, sleep, and somatoform diagnoses. Of all patients, 15.0% had a SUD. Mood (60%), anxiety (31.2%), adjustment (30.9%), and disruptive (attention deficit-hyperactivity, conduct, oppositional defiant, disruptive behavior diagnosis, 22.7%) diagnoses were more common than others (psychotic 14.2%, personality 13.3%, other childhood-onset 11.4%, impulse-control 6.6%, cognitive 2.8%, eating 2.2%, somatoform 2.1%). Less than 1% of children aged < 12 years had SUD. Cannabis diagnosis was the primary SUD affecting adolescents aged 12e17. MRs aged 35-49 years had the highest prevalence of cocaine diagnosis. Controlling for age at first visit, sex, treatment setting, length of treatment, and number of comorbid diagnoses, NHs/PIs and MRs were about two times more likely than AAs to have > 2 SUDs. Regardless of race/ethnicity, personality diagnosis was comorbid with SUD. NHs/PIs with a mood diagnosis had elevated odds of having SUD. Findings present the most comprehensive patterns of mental diagnoses available for treatment-seeking AAs, NHs/PIs, and MRs in the real-world medical setting. In-depth research is needed to elucidate intraracial and interracial differences in treatment needs.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background: Non-Hispanic Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs), and mixed-race individuals are the fastest growing segments of the US population. We examined prevalences and correlates of tobacco use among these understudied groups. Prevalences among whites were included as a comparison. Methods: Data were drawn from the 2002-2010 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Respondents aged >12 years were assessed for current (past-month) use of cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco (chewing tobacco, snuff), and pipe tobacco. Respondents' race/ethnicity, age, sex, household income, government assistance, urbanicity of residence, residential stability, self-rated health, alcohol use, and drug use were examined as correlates. Results: Between 2002 and 2010, there was a decline in the prevalence of cigarette smoking among whites (26.9% in 2002; 24.3% in 2010) and Asian Americans (18.0% in 2002; 11.1% in 2010). Prevalence of pipe tobacco use among mixed-race individuals increased from 0.2% in 2002 to 1.6% in 2010; there was little change in the prevalence of cigar and smokeless tobacco use in these racial/ethnic groups. Adjusted analyses showed that, compared with Asian Americans, mixed-race individuals had greater odds of using four tobacco products, and NHs/PIs had greater odds of using cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Regardless of race/ethnicity, male sex was a correlate of use of cigars, smokeless tobacco, and pipe tobacco; alcohol and drug use increased the odds of cigarette and cigar smoking. Conclusions: These new findings show prevalent tobacco use among NHs/PIs and mixed-race individuals, and highlight the importance of including these populations in future research and reporting.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background: The racial/ethnic composition of the United States is shifting rapidly, with non-Hispanic Asian-Americans, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs), and mixed-race individuals the fastest growing segments of the population. We determined new drug use estimates for these rising groups. Prevalences among Whites were included as a comparison. Methods: Data were from the 2005-2011 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Substance use among respondents aged >12 years was assessed by computer-assisted self-interviewing methods. Respondents' self-reported race/ethnicity, age, gender, household income, government assistance, county type, residential stability, major depressive episode, history of being arrested, tobacco use, and alcohol use were examined as correlates. We stratified the analysis by race/ethnicity and used logistic regression to estimate odds of drug use. Results: Prevalence of past-year marijuana use among Whites increased from 10.7% in 2005 to 11.6-11.8% in 2009-2011 (P < 0.05). There were no significant yearly changes in drug use prevalences among Asian-Americans, NHs/PIs, and mixed-race people; but use of any drug, especially marijuana, was prevalent among NHs/PIs and mixed-race people (21.2% and 23.3%, respectively, in 2011). Compared with Asian-Americans, NHs/PIs had higher odds of marijuana use, and mixed-race individuals had higher odds of using marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens, stimulants, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Compared with Whites, mixed-race individuals had greater odds of any drug use, mainly marijuana, and NHs/PIs resembled Whites in odds of any drug use. Conclusions: Findings reveal alarmingly prevalent drug use among NHs/PIs and mixed-race people. Research on drug use is needed in these rising populations to inform prevention and treatment efforts.

In the case analysis that follows, a couple whom the author calls Sam and Didi will represent a composite of issues that often surface in mixed race or interracial couples. By explicating critical junctures in the therapy of Sam and Didi, this chapter will illustrate the specific relational processes that allow mixed race couples to begin healing the wounds of cultural violation, engage the simultaneity of their experience with greater consciousness, and enlarge their capacity for intimacy with each other.

Edited Book",,,"(from the cover) Relational-Cultural Theory (RCT) posits that people grow through and toward relationship throughout the lifespan. Rather than emphasizing movement toward autonomy and self-sufficiency, it focuses on the power of connection in people's lives. Culture and power are seen as formative in individual and social development. As a model, RCT is ideal for work with couples: it encourages active participation in relationships, fosters the well-being of everyone involved, and provides guidelines for working with disconnections and building relational resilience. Creating Connection helps readers to understand the pain of disconnection and to use RCT to heal relationships in a variety of settings, including with heterosexual couples, stepparents, lesbian and gay couples, and mixed race couples. In addition to an emphasis on helping couples find authentic connection, RCT points to the need for changing the cultural conditions that contribute to the problems of disconnection. Polarities of ""you vs. me"" will be replaced with the healing concept of ""us"".

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Several theories suggest that people do not represent race when it does not signify group boundaries. However, race is often associated with visually salient differences in skin tone and facial features. In this study, we investigated whether race could be decoded from distributed patterns of neural activity in the fusiform gyri and early visual cortex when visual features that often covary with race were orthogonal to group membership. To this end, we used multivariate pattern analysis to examine an fMRI dataset that was collected while participants assigned to mixed-race groups categorized own-race and other-race faces as belonging to their newly assigned group. Whereas conventional univariate analyses provided no evidence of race-based responses in the fusiform gyri or early visual cortex, multivariate pattern analysis suggested that race was represented within these regions. Moreover, race was represented in the fusiform gyri to a greater extent than early visual cortex, suggesting that the fusiform gyri results do not merely reflect low-level perceptual information (e.g. color, contrast) from early visual cortex. These findings indicate that patterns of activation within specific regions of the visual cortex may represent race even when overall activation in these regions is not driven by racial information.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Objectives: Contact theory posits that interracial contact can reduce racial prejudice and perceptions of prejudice. This relationship typically has been looked at from the perspective of whites' views regarding race and racial relations, but few studies have examined the implications of interracial contact for blacks' perceptions regarding the extent of prejudice and discrimination. Methods: With data from the National Survey of Black Workers, I examine whether opportunities for contact in settings with varying racial concentrations in youth and adulthood are associated with blacks' perceptions of prejudice. I use racial concentration-measured here as mostly black settings, half-black (racially balanced) settings, and mostly white settings (compared to all-black settings)-as an indicator of opportunities for interracial contact. Results: Multivariate analyses offer some evidence of the benefits of opportunities for contact in mixed-race and mostly white settings for blacks' perceptions of prejudice. Conclusion: Although having opportunities for contact can be beneficial, this evidence is limited to noncompetitive childhood environments, namely residential neighborhoods. Findings highlight the important of accounting for the racial balance of settings where interracial contact takes place.

Immediately after the war, many children sired by members of the U.S. military were left behind in the care of their Japanese mothers and the Japanese government. Thousands of these multiracial Japanese-born Americans, neither received citizenship from the Japanese government nor were acknowledged by the U.S. government, and were legally stateless. Many were objects of intense discrimination and physical abuse because their visible American features made them politically marked bodies and a symbol of Japan's defeat. In short, they were Americans left overseas without U.S. governmental support, and often without the support of their biological parents. Many of these individuals lived in orphanages for mixed-race people until adopted by American, Japanese, or European families. At the same time they were left in the care of others, numerous American-Japanese grew up with their biological families in the U.S. and in Japan observing interracial marriages and their mixed families firsthand. Quite a few came to the U.S. on their own as teenagers and adults. I document the history of American-Japanese people through oral history, and construct my narrative by contextualizing their voices with archival research. This research is the first to look at life course histories of mixed-race American-Japanese, who are in their fifties and sixties, while examining their transnational experience. My approach of oral history in combination with archival research in English and in Japanese provides a complete historical framework of this population. My contribution to the scholarship connects the existing research on war brides, mixed-race families and Critical Mixed Race Studies and expands it to include the voices of multiracial people, including adoptees, from interracial unions. Upon interviewing multiracial people in the U.S. and Japan, I found that despite discrimination based on differences in race, often their multiracial consciousness served to provide them with options, not limitations. This study gives voice, presence, and historical recognition to American-Japanese whose stories, until now, were rarely told from their perspective.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This paper explores the use of a psychosocial approach to researching drugs, race and ethnicity. It produces an analysis of interviews with Bobby, a mixed-race man in recovery from addiction. Sociological and psychoanalytic perspectives are brought to bear on the data in order to consider the character of Bobby's opportunities, identifications, crises and resolutions. Despite the affective components of the wider discourse on drugs and race, the majority of previous research on the subject has focused on the production of rational explanations produced within objectivist epistemological frames. In contrast, the methods used in this project seek an explicit engagement with the irrational and unconscious aspects of researching these subjects. The paper concludes by reflecting on the value of psychosocially oriented narrative methods in this field.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, Obama and the biracial factor: The battle for a new American majority edited by Andrew J. Jolivette (2012). This book a collection of essays that critically explore the role of US President Barack Obama's biracial background not only in his 2008 election and first term in office but also in the context of an increasingly multiracial USA. This volume is part of a multidisciplinary body of scholarship on 'mixed race' or multiraciality that has grown exponentially in the USA and the UK over the past two decades. However, it also departs from this scholarship's tendency to focus exclusively on the topics of identity formation and racial classification on government forms. Instead, utilizing the timely case of President Obama -'the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas'- the book examines what Jolivette terms 'mixed race hegemony', the assertion that 'biracial and multiracial individuals and families will lead to the end of a race-conscious and racially-discriminatory society in the United States'. Overall, many race scholars, likely, will find Jolivette's concept of 'mixed race hegemony' a more contextualized alternative to broader terms like 'colour-blindness' in the critical examinations of multiraciality.

Compared to Martinique, its ties with France were more tenuous. Unlike in Saint-Domingue, its Creole population-both among masters and slaves-was proportionally larger and formed the core of its society. These qualities make it an ideal site to examine the formation of French Creole culture during the colonial period. Ceramics can help by shedding light on local practices in managing water, cooking, formal dining, and health and hygiene. My analysis is based on the concept of ceramic culture and fits within the broader framework of interpretive archaeology. Considering ceramics as a coherent segment of material culture and focusing on a detailed understanding of what they did for their users enhances their analysis. In Guadeloupe, this approach led me to introduce a new class of ceramics for early modern societies-the water ceramics-and study how water was stored in the domestic sphere. Guadeloupe offered a good terrain for applying this concept. The data came from four sites in the historic capital of Basse-Terre, including the fort of Charles Houel, an influential early leader; and a middling house built in the late eighteenth century, where both white and mixed-race families lived with their slaves. I also analyzed 145 probate inventories covering the years 1774 to 1833. Their rich socio-economic and spatial information allowed me to compare how different economic classes used each type of ceramic object, and how masters and slaves interacted inside the Creole home. Female servants held some important, but historically unacknowledged roles: they managed the water supply of their masters and, with coarse earthenware cookware, invented an array of Creole dishes that form the base of French Antillean cuisine. French faiences helped the Creole elite fashion itself at social events. Objects such as chamber pots, barber's bowls, and drug pots, as well as Antillean folk medical practices, suggest that Guadeloupeans were less afraid of water than the French, and had better hygienic habits-at least, they bathed and shaved more.

The occurrence of the ""biracial baby boom,"" a new post-racial ideology, and the election of the first Black (or biracial depending on one's categorization) U.S. president have led to great hopes for a nation where race no longer matters. On the other hand, there is persistent discrimination including wide disparities in education, wealth, and employment. Thus, does multiracialism signify that society's race relations are improving and that we are deconstructing racial categories and racism? Or, does multiracialism naively overlook the continuing vestiges of race and racism and merely reify ""race"" in efforts to defend the recognition and experiences of those who are ""mixed race?"" Through a study of 70 people of mixed-race descent, I seek an answer to this debate. I ask: how does multiracial identity manifest itself and align with and/or contest the current racial hierarchy? I find 67 of the 70 respondents do prefer a multiracial identity, a preference that reveals the coherence of multiracialism and its ability to challenge the racial hierarchy. Yet, much of this dissertation is dedicated to the differences in experiences of Asian-Whites and Black-Whites. The majority of the Asian-Whites have close White friends and networks, have few experiences and perceptions of racism, and have a color-blind approach to racism. By comparison, Black-Whites are more likely to be aligned with Black networks and Blackness, experience and perceive racism to be a significant problem, and expend significant effort navigating their race. This project, then, has two main findings: (1) those of mixed-race descent are choosing to identify with both races and (2) the continuing significance of race and racism leads to markedly different narratives for those of Asian and White descent compared to those of Black and White descent. Thus, multiracialism has validity yet is limited in its ability to move the discussion forward on race, for it relies on race in order to defy race.

Story stems assessment measures, where children are given the beginning of a story which they are asked to complete, have been widely used to study children's emotional and moral development, as well as their perceptions of family relationships. The Attachment Focused Coding System for Story Stems (AFCS; Reiner & Splaun, 2008) is a newly developed, brief story stem battery and coding system that is grounded in attachment theory. This literature review will provide the theoretical background behind the AFCS, review the literature supporting the use of story stems as a measure of children's internal world, outline the development and extant research on the AFCS, and will describe the story stems of two children from a clinical sample to provide an illustration of how the AFCS captures their internal working models of relationships. Part II: Empirical Article. This study evaluated the validity of the Attachment-Focused Coding System for Story Stems (AFCS; Reiner & Splaun, 2008), which was developed to emphasize children's attachment representations using 4 story stems and 9 codes. Sixty-three parent-child dyads comprised the sample for this study (37 girls; average age 5.6 years; 32 Caucasian, 14 African American, 11 Hispanic, 6 mixed-race). Significant convergence was established with two well-validated coding systems for story stems, the MacArthur Narrative Coding Manual (MNCM; Robinson et al., 2007) and the Little Piggy Coding System (Hodges, Hillman, & Steele, 2004). External criterion validity of the AFCS was demonstrated with a measure of overall child problem behavior (The Childhood Behavior Checklist; Achenbach, 1991), r = .29, p = .05, with the children's current attachment status, and with their mothers' responses to the Parent Development Interview (PDI; Aber et al., 1985). Discriminant validity of the AFCS was demonstrated in the lack of significant correlations with a measure of child linguistic development. This research supports the validity and reliability of the AFCS, indicating that in only 9 codes, the AFCS measures similar information to lengthier systems, captures important correlates of child behavior, and cross-generational aspects of attachment relationships.

In two studies, we focus on the evaluation of mixed-sex work teams, and examine how race and gender of team members affect the evaluations they receive. Participants read about a pair of employees assigned to work together on a ""masculine"" task on which they either succeeded (Study 1) or failed (Study 2). Mixed-sex teams included White pairs, Black pairs, or mixed race pairs (White woman-Black man; Black woman-White man). In both studies, pro-male gender bias was evident only in the White male-White female work pair. We suggest that rather than suffering the double jeopardy of dual subordinate identities, Black women were buffered from the effects of gender bias by virtue of their non-prototypicality or invisibility.

The author's narrative will constitute contextual introductions to discussion topics and iterate direct correlations of her lived experience to larger community and cultural accounts that helped to shape aspects of her Blaxicana identity. The individual and community perceptions of what it means and what it feels like to grow up Negro, Mexican and female in an all black town will determine the scope and complexity of the identity formation factors that may be brought forth in Blaxicana Identity. Geographically situated in the Valley Homes housing projects located in Lincoln Heights, Ohio, just north of Cincinnati, this ethnography will engage the area's background, environment and residents in a dialogue with the larger arenas of race and racism, history, migration, critical race theory, interracial marriage, cultural studies and black towns as they inform the aspects involved in the creation of the author's Blaxicana identity. This multi-perspective engagement will produce a cultural ethnographic portrayal of the Valley Homes, its residents and the author and comprise the ways in which the social and cultural phenomenon of mixed-race identity may be constructed, observed and understood - a depiction that may differ from the historical concepts of identity formation based on color and race. This research will draw its conclusions regarding the construction of a Blaxicana identity by using a critical, self-reflexive method of inquiry that incorporates the author's memories, impressions and artifacts from the 1950's. The author's interracial family experience, defined by an African American father from Nashville, Tennessee and a Mexican mother from Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, presents the opportunity to examine what was then, considering the time and place, an uncommon combination.

However, since our schools are resegregating (Orfield and Eaton 1996), it is not the demography but the spatiality of these projections that is of concern. Not only do we foster growing alienation between nonwhite and white students, we risk further polarization of access to quality educational resources. The latter is because race and socioeconomic class remain so strongly correlated: in other words, because the racialized political economy of education in the U.S. continues to ensure that a school's quality relies primarily on the relative affluence of its neighborhood, impoverished and nonwhite students continue to have limited access to schools with adequate financial resources, high quality instruction and effective administrative leadership. In this dissertation project, I explore the disciplinary connections between geography and Critical Race Theory particularly as applied to educational research, and link these to broader social theories about race, racism and the racial hierarchy. I narrow my analysis to specifically study the relationship between segregation and student achievement. With a restricted-use version of the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, I use a newly-developed measure that not only measures segregation, but also indexes diversity. Using both descriptive statistics and regression models, I find evidence that the racial hierarchy of student achievement can be partly explained by the levels of segregation and diversity in both schools and neighborhoods, and that these patterns differ by racial group, by socioeconomic class, by region and by urbanicity. I conclude that studying multiple places where students spend their time can make and important difference in how we understand racial-and spatial-stratification.

We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 to compare family characteristics of adolescents of a mixed-race or multiethnic background with those of a monoracial or monoethnic background. Mixed-race or multiethnic youth reported feeling less supported by parents and reported less satisfactory parent-adolescent relationships. Mixed-race/multiethnic youth were more like monoracial White youth in terms of being independent but were more like racial or ethnic minorities (African Americans, Hispanics) in regard to family activities. Reasons for these findings are explored. We discuss the need for future research on the experiences of mixed-race/multiethnic youth.

This qualitative phenomenological research study explores the lived experiences of 12 Caucasian male employees in mixed-race leadership dyads where the superiors are African American men. Data were collected from the Symbolic Racism Scale 2000 (SR2K) and from interview responses to 11 open-ended questions. Significant and emergent themes related to perceptions of African American leadership and how perceptions influenced follower behavior became apparent via phenomenological and ideological analysis of the data. Findings did not support being racially different from superiors impacted participant evaluations of their leaders' behaviors or leadership abilities negatively. There was no corroboration that racial stereotypes and perceptions of African American leadership had influenced the follower behavior, job integrity, or job performance of the study's participants negatively. There was some evidence from the findings of color-blind racism, a racial ideology that suggests racism and discrimination are no longer problems and America has become a post-racial society. Based on the findings, strategies to augment diversity training initiatives originally designed to address the inequalities inherent in the structure of American organizations is recommended. A different approach to further research to address the absence of empirical research regarding the atypical workplace dyad studied is recommended. Further research to augment the scarcity of empirical research related to the phenomenon of African American leadership in general is also recommended.

Politicized issues around multiraciality frame and impact the campus climate for diversity, but research is scant on the climate for multiracial students. This thesis uses a three-article format to develop an Integrative Model of Multiraciality (IMM) and apply it to examine interpersonal and institutional dimensions of campus climate. The first article constructs the IMM from extant literature and theorizes racialization processes for multiracial students in college contexts. The IMM depicts that racialized experiences of campus climate vary based on racial classification, which is informed by physical appearance, ancestry, socioeconomic status, cultural knowledge, interest convergence with monoracially-constructed groups, and the fluidity of peer culture. The second study uses a quantitative methodology to look at how racially classifying students who mark two-or-more racial categories changes racial groups' representations of experiencing discrimination and bias in college at fourteen institutions across the United States. When aggregated into a single group, students who mark two or more racial categories experience discrimination more frequently than students who only indicate a white background, suggesting mixed race students do not occupy an ""honorary white"" status as might commonly be assumed. However, double minority multiracial students have higher frequencies of discrimination than minority/white multiracial students, indicating that relative whiteness may result in comparative privilege for the latter group. The final study applies the IMM to interviews with fourteen multiracial undergraduates at a single campus to show how perceptions of multiple racisms in organizational campus structures vary based on socioeconomic status, white cultural knowledge, and whether or not they publicly identify with student organizations reflecting their non-white background(s), which were more important than racial ancestry in climate perceptions. Similarities and differences in the quality of campus climate for multiraciality emerge in each study, allowing these students to be examined both as a group and as members of their respective monoracially-constructed groups. The articles critically connect racial theory, classification, and campus climate. This research gives voice to multiracially-identifying students and their poignant experiences around race and racism in college with implications for further research and institutional practice for developing inclusive campuses.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, Raising Brooklyn: Nannies, Childcare, and Caribbeans Creating Community by Tamara Mose Brown (2011). Tamara Mose Brown's new book, continues with this high-quality research and extends the analysis to new spheres. The author, a graduate student and mother of toddlers when she did the research, conducted participant observation and interviews over a period of 3 years with 25 West Indian nannies in a gentrifying neighborhood of Brooklyn. She also interviewed 10 employers of nannies, but we don't hear too much about them. The author grew up in a Trinidadian immigrant household, and identifies as mixed race; yet she recognizes that like many of the West Indian immigrant nannies she studied, she is racially identified by others as black. All of the research subjects worked as live-out nannies in the neighborhood where the author lived as a resident, and the park benches in the local public parks provide one of the main places of study. This is a rich book. The study is beautifully observed, written in a calm affect, hitting the right pitch. We sociologists don't usually evaluate this aspect of writing, but tone sets the scene for both ethnographic description and analysis. This book shows an important part of urban life in Brooklyn that goes beyond the media's glossy portrayal of Brooklyn as iconic hipster neighborhood.

This study also explored whether or not there are any differences among each of the racial identity groups' perceptions of institutional support for mixed race college students. The theoretical framework of this study was formed by Chickering's Theory of Psychosocial Identity Development, Wijeyesinghe's Factor Model of Multiracial Identity, and Renn's Patterns of Multiracial Identity. The eight research questions that guided this study addressed hypothesized factors that may have a relationship with a mixed race student's racial identity and students' perceptions of institutional support for mixed race students. The sample included traditional age college students (18-24 at the time of the survey) who are mixed race (which is defined as having biological parents belonging to different racial groups) and enrolled as full-time students (registered for twelve or more credits) at an institution that was a member of the University System of Georgia. This study employed a survey instrument that included 63 multiple-choice and Likert scale questions and was divided into six sections: (a) racial ancestry, (b) racial identity, (c) physical appearance, (d) cultural attachment, (e) other social identities, and (f) institutional characteristics. The following quantitative methods were employed to analyze the collected data: (a) descriptive statistics, (b) Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, (c) analysis of variance, (d) multinomial logistic regression, and (e) factor analysis. Implications for future research, policy, and practice are included.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Black beauty shame emerges within the Black/white binary because of the beauty values sedimented in our structure of feeling since African enslavement. This article does not start from white beauty as the ideal, but focuses on the performativity of Black beauty shame as it transforms or intensifies the meanings of parts of the body in Jamaica and its UK diaspora. Using extracts from interviews with UK Jamaican heritage women, the discussion illustrates how Black beauty shame produces such intensification. First, where white beauty is iconic and reproduces the Black other as 'ugly', and second, where the Black 'mixed race' body is constructed as 'other' because of Black Nationalist discourses on beauty. The women's critique of the shaming event shows that shame is undone through dis-identification as speakers draw on alternative beauty discourses to produce new beauty subjectivities. Dis-identification illustrates the transformational potential of shame as new Black beauty positionings emerge within the diaspora, drawing on beauty ideologies and models from Jamaica and thus destabilising the Black/white binary.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This paper introduces a group of white working-class women living on a council estate in the UK drawing on an ethnographic study conducted between 2005 and 2009, examining the impact of class inequality and a stigmatized living space in an ethnically diverse urban neighbourhood. All of the women are mothers and have mixed-race children; they reside on the St Ann's estate in Nottingham, an inner-city neighbourhood that has been subject to poor housing, poverty and unemployment for many generations. The women who live on this estate say that they suffer from negative stereotypes and stigmatization because of the notoriety of the estate, because they are working class and because they have had sexual relationships with black men. However, there is a sense of connectedness to the estate and there are strong cultural meanings that are heavily influenced by the West Indian community. This paper then highlights the importance of place when focusing upon families, class inequality and intercultural relationships.

Unfortunately, most models have been developed from small samples with particular blended combinations (e.g. Black/White, Japanese/White) and have not been tested on larger, more diverse samples. In other words, the efforts to develop mixed race identity models have not been matched with subsequent efforts to develop racial/ethnic identity scales. The creation and validation of a multiracial identity scale is an important contribution to critical mixed race studies to facilitate systematic findings on identity for multiracial individuals of various combinations. This dissertation will focus on the initial development of the Multiracial Reference Group Orientation Scale (MRGOS). The MRGOS was originally designed to measure four reference group orientations found in empirical research among multiracial populations: single RGO (orientation toward one parent ethnic group), multigroup RGO (orientation toward multiple parent ethnic groups), mixed race RGO (orientation toward other mixed race people as a group), and postracial RGO (nonidentification with parent ethnic groups and rejection of racial categorization). The MRGOS has been developed using an online survey targeting mixed race undergraduates at several four-year colleges and universities in California. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis yielded a six-factor scale. Five of the factors conformed to the RGOs proposed in the model, including two postracial factors, though one non-RGO factor (Exploration) was also extracted from the original list of items. Adequate internal consistency was found for all of the RGO subscales except for the second postracial subscale. Partial support was found for the known groups validity of the mixed race, single, and one of the postracial subscales. Steps for the further development of the scale and the broader implications of the scale for research on race and ethnicity are discussed.

To address this gap, we must better investigate the lived realities of racism in the gay community. In this study, we had the unique opportunity to examine experiences of racism among African American, Asian/Pacific Islander and Latino men who have sex with men living in Los Angeles through focus groups and individual in-depth interviews. We found three themes of racism: exclusion from West Hollywood and the mainstream gay community, sexual rejection based on race/ethnicity and sexual stereotypes. There were differences across the three racial groups in the experiences of each theme, however. We then considered how racism impacted partner selection and found that race played a salient role in determining power differentials within mixed-race partnerships. Finally, we discussed several future areas for research that can better establish pathways between racism and sexual risk.

While much educational research emphasizes the academic underachievement of urban minority students, this project uncovers and analyzes the factors that lead to these high school students' academic success. These factors are: (1) how some elementary and middle schools operate as a pipeline to an elite high school and the role that social class plays; (2) a high achieving school climate that defines academic expectations; (3) the influence of racial/ethnic identities and colorblind ideologies (Cultural Mainstreamers & Cultural Straddlers); and (4) the role that extra-curricular activities in churches, college bridge programs, and caring teachers play in the formation of their social capital. I found that there were substantial differences between our groups in terms of class and social capital formation. Implications for urban education teacher education and policy will be discussed within the framework of this study.

Design: Focus groups (n = 16) were used to collect qualitative data. Quantitative data collected included demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric (heights and weights). Setting: Community centers, libraries, and homeless shelters in low-income neighborhoods. Participants: Of the 83 participants, 58 % were African-American, 28 % were white, and the remainder were American Indian, Hispanic, or mixed race. A total of 35% of participants were lean/normal (body mass index <25 kg/m2) and 65 % were overweight/'obese (body mass index >25 kg/m2). Method: Focus group methodology was used to collect data on 83 participants. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) provided the theoretical basis. Transcripts were analyzed using the open-coding method and comments between lean/normal and overweight/obese women were systematically compared. Results: Focus group themes were food environment, aberrant eating behavior, health values, and beliefs. Differences in personal and behavioral factors were apparent between overweight/obese and lean/normal women, with the former group frequently discussing emotional eating, overeating, and stashing food, and the latter group communicating greater nutrition knowledge and describing regular physical activity. Both groups similarly expressed experiences with food insecurity and lived in low-income environments. Conclusion: For low-income women, personal and behavioral factors may modify the influence of their obesogenic food environment. Further research within the context of SCT should examine differences between lean/normal and overweight/obese women living in the same environment.

For the purposes of this study, community is defined as ""a feeling that members have of belonging, that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their commitment to be together"" (McMillan & Chavis, 1986, p. 9). Participants were between the ages of 21 and 61, two men and five women, and self-identified as Filipino and white. Participants were interviewed using a semistructured questionnaire. Interviews were then transcribed and coded for themes using phenomenological data analysis. Four primary themes emerged: (a) group exclusion, (b) independence, (c) being influential, that is, a desire to be in a position to impact others, and (d) group inclusion. A number of subthemes were identified as well. Similar to other research (Hall, C., 1980; Stephan, 1992) this study found that community was influenced by physical appearance, social support, neighborhood demographics, cultural exposure, and group acceptance. Finally, this study confirmed the significance of community in the positive self-identity of mixed race persons (Collins, 2000; and Milville, 2005). The findings from this study can help strengthen the therapeutic relationship with clients as they engage in the frequently challenging processes of developing both positive ethnic identity and supportive community.

In this dissertation, I apply a borderlands framework to learn about lived experiences in relationship to three central concepts within social work: community, belonging, and wellbeing. This project integrates elements of transnational feminism, postcolonial studies, and borderland epistemology within a queer framework, employing theoretical pluralism to interpret stories of lived lives, material realities, and perceived wellbeing. Using critical narrative and feminist methodologies, I interviewed 12 adults in the Seattle area who identified in flexible, critical, or ambiguous ways across race, gender, and sexuality; most study participants self-identified as mixed race and queer. I explore articulations and intimations of liminality and belonging used by participants to make meaning of being in community and being well. Emerging from this analysis is a conceptual framework to understand belongingness in community borderlands and corresponding, contradictory experiences that enhance and detract from participants perceived wellbeing. Wellbeing itself, from a borderland perspective, is understood through participant positions on reclaiming ""healthy bodies,"" priority-setting within their communities, and critical self-reflection regarding the intentional creation of spaces and the unintentional replication of oppressive practices and discourses. This dissertation challenges the singular assumption that liminal status is a source of chronic stress and social disconnection that deteriorates wellbeing. Instead, I demonstrate that borderland experiences of community may provide a sense of connectedness that actually enhances perceived and actual wellbeing through increased resources, sense of safety, and belonging. However, I also highlight the complexity, ambiguity, and discontinuities of these relationships. This study suggests the application of a borderlands framework in social work scholarship, pedagogy, and practice, namely by informing existing and potential collaborative community efforts to address disparities and promote wellbeing.

There has been little scholarly attention devoted, though, to where people with Mexican and other ethnoracial backgrounds fit within ethnoracial paradigms. Framed within historical and contemporary mestiz@ and multiracial identity theories, I gathered data through oral histories with Central and Northern California individuals as well as archival, oral history, and autoethnographic research on multiple generations of my Vermont family. The study contextualizes California narrators' identity formations within familial, community, and national histories to argue that, despite thorough boundary policing by monoethnically identified Mexican American and other communities, narrators inherited familial, community, cultural, sexual, and personal resources that modeled first- and multigenerational ethnoracial mixing as common and/or the integration of binaries as possible. Such models facilitated narrators' development of their own integrated mixed race, Mexican-descent identities, which they achieved by actively developing one or more of five tool patterns. The study also addresses the issue of ethnoracial identity migration, and employs an ecological approach to examine how changes in certain intersectional identity vectors (e.g., age, class, geography, and family dynamics) can lead to minor or major ethnoracial identity migrations. Furthermore, I analyze the history of ethnoracial identity over three generations of my Vermont family in terms of the models, tool patterns, and intersectional vector analyses from above, via the overarching framework of my own identity experiences. Such work ultimately requires me to redefine ""success"" and ""failure"" in my historical inquiry, moving from ""fact"" to antiracist, feminist intervention in my family's ethnoracial memory. The comparative nature of the study is distinctive. First, most studies about the multiracial Mexican-descent community thus far have each looked at one ethnoracial heritage combination (e.g. Mexipino, Punjabi Mexican American, White/Mexican), whereas this study attends to multiple ""Mexican-and"" backgrounds. This provides important insight into how particular inter-community histories influence the articulation of Mexican American and multiracial identities. Second, I redefine ""Mexican American""/""Chican@"" as contemporarily (first-, second-, or third+-generation), rather than only historically, mixed. At the same time, however, I position multigenerational inheritance as central to the ethnoracial self-making of people with contemporarily mixed backgrounds.

Scientists argued that mixing in this ""racial laboratory"" improved the quality of the majority non-white population, that migration and colonization were features of a natural historical trajectory of Americanization, and that race relations in the islands were the product of a human ecology that went hand in hand with capitalist development. All of these ideas became the racial common sense that traveled to the continental U.S. and perpetuated American amnesia about empire. This project revisits the historiography of the supposed retreat of scientific racism and, by closely examining the methods, actual data, and conclusions of scientists whose work shaped their disciplines, demonstrates how racialist thinking persisted in work that has been characterized as either questioning the race concept, as politically progressive, or both. Taking cues from studies of settler colonialism in Hawai'i and recent debate about the actuality of a retreat of scientific racism in the United States, this dissertation demonstrates how treating assimilation as a natural process that needed to be better understood, rather than a discursive project of colonial governance, legitimated American power in the islands. During a period when scientists and politicians alike were interested in fitness, degeneracy, and the consequences of immigration and miscegenation as part of debates about national progress, scientists viewed Hawai'i as a laboratory where they could conduct research on heredity and cultural change that was difficult or impossible to do in the continental United States. American social scientists working in Hawai'i framed the processes they studied, particularly the assimilation of mixed race people and Asian migrants into American culture and identity, as natural rather than ideological. American scientists with sometimes opposing political orientations such as Louis R. Sullivan and L.C. Dunn concluded that, unlike mixed race people generally and especially ""mulattoes,"" Chinese-Hawaiian ""hybrids"" were actually improvements on their supposedly pure parents (chapter 1). Physical anthropologist Harry Shapiro, in his study of racial plasticity among migrants in a changed environment, developed few concrete findings, but helped establish Hawai'i as a long-term human research site. Sociologist Romanzo Adams, who was trained at the University of Chicago, produced the history of Hawai'i as a history of admixture that exaggerated the degree of interracial reproduction and suggested that the territorial population was well on its way to complete biological amalgamation (chapter 3). Through a series of interviews with couples in interracial marriages and the collection of student papers about identity and racial prejudice, many of which contradicted Adams' findings and predictions, graduate researcher Margaret M. Lam recorded the testimony of residents who both resisted certain types of racialization as they also participated in the construction and maintenance of racial boundaries and meanings (chapter 4). Finally, sociologist Andrew Lind, framed social inequality and tense race relations in the territory as a product of competition for jobs and housing, a ""natural"" feature of ""human ecology,"" rather than a product of intentional labor control and government decisions (chapter 5). This advanced the idea that social conditions in Hawai'i were a natural product of modernization rather colonization.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background: The Internet and other eHealth technologies offer a platform for improving the dissemination and accessibility of psychoeducational programs for youth with chronic illness. However, little is known about the recruitment process and yield of diverse samples in Internet research with youth who have a chronic illness. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of youth with Type 1 diabetes on recruitment, participation, and satisfaction with 2 eHealth psychoeducational programs. Methods: Youth with Type 1 diabetes from 4 sites in the United States were invited to participate (N = 510) with 320 eligible youth consenting (mean age = 12.3, SD 1.1; 55.3% female; 65.2% white; and mean A1C = 8.3, SD 1.5). Data for this secondary analysis included demographic information (age, race/ethnicity, and income), depressive symptoms, and recruitment rates, including those who refused at point of contact (22.0%), passive refusers who consented but did not participate (15.3%), and those who enrolled (62.7%). Participation (80% lessons completed) and a satisfaction survey (ie, how helpful, enjoyable) were also analyzed. Chi-square or analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses were used. Results: There were significant differences in recruitment rates by income and race/ethnicity such that black, Hispanic, or mixed race/ethnicity and low-income youth were more likely to refuse passively compared to white and higher-income youth who were more likely to enroll (P < .001). Participation in program sessions was high, with 78.1% of youth completing at least 4 of 5 sessions. There were no significant differences in participation by program, age, gender, or race/ethnicity. Low-income youth were less likely to participate (P = .002). Satisfaction in both programs was also high (3.9 of 5). There were significant gender, race/ethnicity, and income differences, in that girls (P = .001), black, Hispanic, or mixed race/ethnicity youth (P = .02), and low-income youth (P = .02) reported higher satisfaction. There were no differences in satisfaction by program or age. Conclusions: Results indicate that black, Hispanic, or mixed race/ethnicity youth and low-income youth with Type 1 diabetes are less likely to enroll in Internet-based research than white and higher-income youth; thus, creative recruitment approaches are needed. Low-income youth were less likely to participate, possibly due to access. However, once enrolled, youth of diverse race/ethnicity and low-income youth with Type 1 diabetes were as highly satisfied with the eHealth programs as white youth and those with higher income. Results suggest that eHealth programs have the potential to reach diverse youth and be appealing to them.

Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered via questionnaires and interviews from parents of the treatment (n = 8) and comparison groups (n = 5). Parents of participants participated in a pre--intervention interview as well as completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. The interview included open-ended questions regarding parents' perceptions of their child's social skills and emotional regulation. Participants were ages 5 to 12 years old; ethnicities included Caucasian, Asian American, and mixed race. Each participant in the treatment group received 15 weeks of continuous therapeutic riding, which consisted of one 30--minute session per week. The comparison group did not undergo the intervention but instead received a multidisciplinary educational approach. The research question that guided this research was: Does therapeutic riding have a beneficial effect on the social and emotional lives of children with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, as assessed by the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Sensory Profile (SP)? Quantitative results for the treatment group revealed an increase in social and emotional functioning in the forms of increased social communication, social interactions, reciprocal social skills, communication skills, and multisensory integration in social situations; and a decrease in autistic mannerisms, restricted and repetitive behaviors. Quantitative results for the comparison group also showed an increase in social and emotional coping strategies and a decrease in sensory-seeking behaviors to self-stimulate.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) In this chapter ""Southern Africa"" is restricted to South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. South Africa has 90% of this region's population; the other three countries are incorporated into the South African economy by their overwhelming dependence on bilateral trade and by longstanding patterns of labor migration. This chapter does not consider fathering among the original foraging or hunter-gathering population, who were by the time of European settlement restricted to areas too dry for cattle-herding or cultivation. Nor is it much concerned with fathering among the white population, for whom aspirations and institutional arrangements concerning family life are relatively similar to those in Western Europe and North America. This chapter focuses on the behavioral patterns and problems of fathering among the 45 million black Africans who make up 81% of the population of the region. Unless otherwise specified, references to men, women, families, and population are restricted to black Africans. South Africa's population is 9% white and 11% ""other"" (mostly ""coloured"" or mixed race, or of South Asian ancestry), and the percentage of the population that is black in Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland are 97%, 99%, and 97%, respectively. The national population of South Africa is 49 million; of Botswana and Lesotho it is 2 million each; and of Swaziland it is 1.35 million. In the regional map, the names of ethnic groups are indications of the areas of their greatest concentration; all the peoples of the region are now widely distributed. Southern African cultures include important roles for men in the lives of children even though the care of young children is seen as women's responsibility within a gendered division of labor and social activity. In a system of distributed or collective fatherhood, the father is one of several men expected to contribute to a child's well-being and fathers are expected to play a role in the lives of children other than their own offspring. More than a century of white domination, labor migration, and racial segregation have separated families. Social policy and cultural attitudes increasingly emphasize financial support as the central aspect of adequate fathering, but massive unemployment and economic inequality make it impossible for many fathers to provide financial support to their children. Families and governments must acknowledge and encourage the many non-financial ways that men can contribute to the lives of children. This chapter includes the following elements: 1) A case story of a specific father(s); 2) Cultural and historical influences on fathering; 3) Comprehensive review of fathering research in the target culture(s) or region; 4) Social policy issues related to fathering; 5) Sub-cultural variations in fathering; 6) Contemporary social/economic conditions that affect fathering; 7) Speculation, predictions for the future, and comparisons with fathers in other societies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"During a period of unprecedented ethnicity data collection in Britain, an almost universal characteristic of this practice has been the mandated use of the decennial census ethnicity classifications. In Canada and the USA a greater plurality of methods has included open response, now recommended for the 2020 US Census. As the ethnic diversity of Britain has increased, driven by immigration dynamics and population mixing leading to 'superdiversity', the census is no longer able to capture the new populations. The validity and utility of unprompted open response is examined in several 'mixed race' datasets. It is argued that open response can be a modus operandi for large-scale ethnicity data collection and that the lack of consistency in recording of such responses need not necessarily be viewed as a drawback. Open response offers substantial insights into the country's superdiversity in a way that ethnicity categorization alone cannot.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Preparing healthy community members with timely communications prior to engaging them in a request to donate biospecimens promises to improve the experience of biobanking participation. To this end, a qualitative study was conducted to assess community member knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and informational needs about cancer-related biospecimen collection in a large metropolitan area in southwest Florida. The study utilized purposive sampling techniques to recruit a total of 95 participants to participate in 12 focus groups, segmented by race/ethnicity and language preference (mixed race, African American only, and Spanish speaking) and age (18-29, 30-54, and 55 and older). Focus group interviews were analyzed using content analysis to identify emergent themes. Overall, participants in the 30 years and older groups were favorable toward participating in biobanking if their concerns were addressed, such as confidentiality and consent issues, in contrast to participants aged 18-29 who were more skeptical. For all participants, the desire to participate in research that seeks new cancer treatments outweighed mistrust. Moreover, many cited the potential scientific benefit for future generations as a primary motivator. Finally, in some groups a therapeutic misconception was expressed, where participants expressed a willingness to forego confidentiality of their health status in exchange for therapeutic benefit. This study contributes to the literature on community perceptions of the benefits and barriers of biobanking and adds to the development of meaningful education communication priming tools to advance understandings about biobanking.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Introduction: As all published measures of dependence for users of smokeless tobacco (dippers) have poor reliability, in the present work the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) and the Autonomy Over Smoking Scale (AUTOS) were evaluated for use with this population. Dippers and smokers were also compared in relation to dependence, the pleasure derived from using tobacco and the latency to the onset of withdrawal. Methods: In 2010, an anonymous self-completed paper survey was administered to 1541 students of mixed race and ethnicity in grades 9-12 (mean age 15.9 years) in a Florida high school where students used cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Results: The reliability (Cronbach's alpha) for the HONC was 0.90 for smokers (n = 139) and 0.91 for dippers (n = 85), and for the AUTOS was 0.94 for smokers and dippers. Dippers and smokers did not differ significantly in relation to scores on the HONC, AUTOS, latency to withdrawal onset or pleasure derived from smoking. One or more symptoms on the HONC were reported by 56% of dippers and 57% of smokers with <100 lifetime uses of their favoured tobacco product, and by 91% of dippers and 91% of smokers with >100 lifetime uses (not significant). Greater lifetime use was associated with a significantly shorter latency to withdrawal for smokers and dippers. Conclusions: The HONC and AUTOS are highly reliable measures of dependence for adolescent users of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Using these measures and other indicators, no meaningful differences in dependence were found between dippers and smokers at comparable levels of lifetime use.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Evidence indicates that superior memory for own-group versus other-group faces (termed own-group bias) occurs because of social categorization: People are more likely to encode own-group members as individuals. The authors show that aspects of the perceiver's social identity shape social attention and memory over and above mere categorization. In three experiments, participants were assigned to a mixed-race minimal group and showed own-group bias toward this minimal group, regardless of race. Own-group bias was mediated by attention toward own-group faces during encoding (Experiment 1). Furthermore, participants who were highly identified with their minimal group had the largest own-group bias (Experiment 2). However, social affordances attenuated own-group bias-Memory for other-group faces was heightened among participants who were assigned to a role (i.e., spy) that required attention toward other-group members (Experiment 3). This research suggests that social identity may provide novel insights into person memory.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background: South Africa's Western Cape has experienced a dramatic increase in methamphetamine (""meth"") use over the past decade. There is concern that meth may further fuel the HIV epidemic in this country because of its association with risky sexual behaviors. This study describes the prevalence of meth use and its relation to HIV sexual risk behaviors among patrons of alcohol-serving venues. Methods: Participants (N = 3328) were surveyed in 12 venues in a mixed race township. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relations between meth use and sexual risk behaviors, and structural equation models were used to test whether meth use mediates the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and current sexual risk. Results: Meth use in the past 4 months was more common among Coloured than Black persons (10.5% vs. 3.5%). Meth users were more likely than non users to use marijuana, inhalants, and injection drugs, have a history of childhood sexual and/or physical abuse, and experience and/or perpetrate intimate partner violence. Among both men and women, meth use was associated with greater odds of engaging in sexual risk behaviors, and meth use partially mediated the relationships between childhood sexual abuse and all sexual risk behaviors. Conclusions: Meth users in this setting are at increased risk for HIV due to their greater likelihood of engaging in sexual risk behaviors and being in violent relationships. There is an urgent need to provide targeted HIV prevention and substance abuse treatment to meth users living in townships in Cape Town.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The growing presence and visibility of mixed race persons in the US demands that social workers critically examine and understand the complexity of multiracial identity. This qualitative investigation examined the narratives of ten multiracial adults about their identity experiences living as multiracial persons. Utilizing paradigmatic analysis of narratives, five major themes emerged. Four of these themes correspond to categories found in existing multiracial scholarship, and include: (1) Shifting racial/ethnic expressions; (2) Racial/ethnic ambiguity; (3) Feeling like an outsider; and (4) Seeking community. The final theme, (5) Racial resistance, contributes new knowledge to our understanding of how multiracial individuals respond to societal pressures to conform to traditional means of categorizing others by race. Findings from this study confirm a collective multiracial experience; one with direct ties to the social and environmental pressures associated with having a multifaceted identity in a color-conscious society. Practice implications and directions for future research are offered.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background/Context: The history curriculum is often used to help reach the goal of racial tolerance and understanding by teaching about the nation's diversity. Many educators believe that teaching about diverse peoples in schools will bring about greater equity in society. This historical study looks at the segregated American South from 1928 to 1943 and an effort by a mixed-race voluntary organization to teach Black history in White schools. Focus of Study: This study examines the efforts of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation (CIC), beginning in 1928, to promote the teaching of Black history in southern segregated schools in an effort to bring about greater racial tolerance and awareness. The CIC circulated a booklet, which was a short history of African Americans titled ""America's Tenth Man,"" and invited schools to submit essays on Black history for cash prizes. The contests ran from 1928 until 1943, when the CIC was renamed the Southern Regional Council, which reflected a change in the organization's emphasis on regional planning. Research Design: This is a historical examination of teaching Black history in segregated schools. The author relies on primary sources-including teachers' reports, correspondence, and students' projects-and secondary studies in the history of education and the curriculum. Conclusions: By challenging historians' views of the CIC-that the organization was largely ineffectual and that its Tenth Man contests did not result in any measureable improvement in race relations in the South-the author raises questions about the implementation of Black history curricula in order to influence students' behavior and attitudes about race. Likewise, the author shows how White teachers were outspoken activists for Black history in schools. The study concludes that the teaching of Black history to White students was not uniform and was ideologically diverse.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This study explores how religious congregations interact with other community organizations to address health and, in particular, HIV-related needs within their membership and/or local communities. Case study data from a diverse sample of 14 urban congregations (6 Black, 4 Latino, 2 White, and 2 mixed race-ethnicity) indicate that they engaged in three types of relationships to conduct HIV and other health-related activities: (a) resources flowed to congregations from external entities, (b) resources flowed from congregations to external entities, and (c) congregations interacted with external entities. These types of relationships were present in roughly equal proportions; thus, congregations were not primarily the recipients of resources from other organizations in these interactions. Financial, material, and human capital resources were shared across these three relationship types, and the most common organization types that congregations were involved with for health efforts were prevention and social service organizations, health care providers, and other congregations. In addition, congregations tended to have more collaborative relationships with other faith-based organizations (FBOs) and tended to engage with non-FBOs more to either receive or provide resources. Results suggest that congregations contribute to community health by not only sponsoring health activities for their own members but also by providing specific support or resources to enhance the programming of other community organizations and collaborating with external organizations to sponsor congregation-based and community-based health activities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"When the words 'identity' or 'community' are evoked, a homogenizing process forms for the sake of community coherence. This article is based upon interviews with nine bisexual and mixed race participants about their conceptualization of identity-based communities. All participants expressed discontent with the 'established' gay and lesbian community for being monolithically White in racial composition and also biphobic. More than one half of the participants had been involved in queer Asian American women's organizations, within which they felt the least conflict and the most inclusion. The ideals of identity-based organizations have only sporadically manifested themselves for the bisexual-biracial women who are otherwise marginalized, silenced or excluded. Because their diverse needs and identities are not represented within these organizations, many of the participants felt they gave more than they received. Finding that communities based upon narrow identity clusters were not ideal, the participants created diverse communities based upon their expanded interests and identities. These bisexual-biracial women have revolutionized their personal concepts of community as they integrated the ideals of identity politics yet moved to include individuals who share similar progressive politics, responsibility and acceptance.

This study examined underlying contextual factors associated with substance abuse among a nationally representative sample of White, Native American, and Mixed-Race adolescents 12-17 years of age, using combined datasets from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH 2006-2009, N = 46,675, 48.77 % female). Native American adolescents displayed the highest rate of past-month binge drinking and past-year illicit drug use (14.06 and 30.91 %, respectively). Results of a logistic regression that included seven predictors of social bonding, individual views of substance use, and delinquent peer affiliations showed that friendships with delinquent peers and negative views of substance use were associated significantly with both substance abuse outcomes among White and Mixed-Race adolescents and, to a lesser extent, Native American adolescents. The association of parental disapproval with binge drinking was stronger for White than for Native American adolescents. Greater attention to specific measures reflecting racial groups' contextual and historical differences may be needed to delineate mechanisms that discourage substance abuse among at-risk minority adolescent populations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Many scholars advocate the adoption of a black-and-white lens for the analysis of racial inequality in Brazil. Drawing on a nationally representative dataset that includes race questions in multiple formats, we evaluate how removal of the 'brown' category from the census or other social surveys would likely affect: (1) the descriptive picture of Brazil's racial composition; and (2) estimates of income inequality between and within racial categories. We find that a forced binary question format results in a whiter and more racially unequal picture of Brazil through the movement of many higher income mixed-race respondents into the white category. We also find that regardless of question format, racial inequality in income accounts for relatively little of Brazil's overall income inequality. We discuss implications for public policy debates in Brazil, and for the broader scientific and political challenges of ethnic and racial data collection and analysis.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"During the same time period, the United States, Great Britain and Canada all moved towards 'counting' mixed-race on their national censuses. In the United States, this move is largely attributed to the existence of a mixed-race social movement that pushed Congress for the change-but similar developments in Canada and Britain occurred without the presence of a politically active civil society devoted to making the change. Why the convergence? This article argues that demographic trends, increasingly unsettled perceptions about discrete racial categories, and a transnational norm surrounding the primacy of racial self-identification in census-taking culminated in a normative shift towards multiracial multiculturalism. Therein, mixed-race identities are acknowledged as part of-rather than problematic within-diverse societies. These elements enabled mixed-race to be promoted, at times strategically, as a corollary of multiculturalism in these three countries.

Since the end of apartheid in 1994, the racial hierarchy that regulated social relations in white-ruled South Africa has broken down, undermining basic assumptions and practices at the foundation of this ethno-racial category. This dissertation explores the diverse ways that coloured people construct and reconstruct colouredness: appropriating and layering various aspects of the past and the present-race, class, ethnicity, place and popular culture-to fashion identities that invoke apartheid constructions of coloured identity while affording opportunities to forge new identities that respond to the new, post-apartheid moment. The dissertation is based on two years of ethnographic research conducted in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg between 2005 and 2008. In Mixed Feelings, I approach the study of coloured identity on multiple levels. I am interested in how the coloured community identifies from within as well as how it is identified from without; thus, in addition to extensive interviews, I analyze census data, published reports concerning the current economic profiles of different racial groups in South Africa, crime statistics, as well as data gathered from media sources such as local television, newspapers, and websites. This dissertation, focusing on race, ethnicity, class, globalization, and popular culture in South Africa, seeks to place these historical dynamics in a broader context through comparisons with both the United States and the Caribbean. Based on this data, I address the particular techniques coloured people use to negotiate the coloured category within the new social, political and economic realities of contemporary South Africa. I am also concerned with understanding the strategies used by coloured activists and organizers and other South Africans to keep coloured people locked within the coloured category. By revealing the challenges coloured people face as they try to negotiate colouredness in contemporary South Africa, this dissertation contributes to theoretical discussions that ask how people negotiate their identity under conditions that limit their choices.

The firm adopting the ""red hat"" strategy or individuals seeking partners with matching assets and qualifications can all be seen as agents who try to maximize their utilities by searching for what they regard as the most profitable action. The dissertation includes three distinct chapters. The first chapter reexamines the status exchange hypothesis (Davis 1941; Merton1941), and specifically reanalyzes the data from Fu (2001) on recent marriages among whites, blacks, Mexicans, and Japanese (from the 1990 PUMS data), which claims to corroborate the status exchange hypothesis for intermarriage between whites and blacks as well as between whites and Mexican Americans. Using a simple quasi-symmetry model, I show that the same-race and mixed-race marriage share a broadly similar pattern of educational homogamy, which is quasi-symmetric in character. Thus, I argue that this suggests little, if any, evidence for the status exchange hypothesis. Furthermore, the evidence strongly indicates that there is a remarkable consistency and symmetry in husband/wife educational attainment regardless of race (with the possible exception of white/white marriages); intermarried couples share a similar level of education, and educational homogamy dominates the educational marriages, no matter what their or their spouse's races are. The second chapter employs a game theory framework as well as case studies to examine the interactions between entrepreneurs and local governments under transitional institutions and examine how these actors play extensive games with perfect information. According to this game, the adoption of the ""red hat"" strategy is the rational results of the interaction between private firms and local governments. The third chapter employs multi-level logistic models to examine the ACS 2008 data and shows that the multilevel modeling helps to decompose the variance of intermarriage to individual level (preference) and context-level characteristics constraints in the analysis of interracial marriage. Metropolitan-level variables, which are typically ignored in previous research, provide additional understanding of the previous of Asian interracial and endogamous marriage in the United States. Studies of interracial marriage can no longer easily overlook the population geographic distribution and the nativity or generation structure of minority groups.

Jacobs' well-researched biography, The Other Barack: The Bold and Reckless Life of President Obama's Father, helps us sort through some myths surrounding the relationship of the President's parents. Dinesh Sharma writes about the physical abuse of Barack Jr.'s childhood in Indonesia and Hawaii. Justin Frank has written Obama on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President. Frank recognizes that Ann Obama needed to disguise the family history when dealing with her son. For the notion of ""the mother and son"" being ""left by the father,"" Frank writes, ""is a fantasy"" as the mother ""was living in Settle at the time of Barack Sr's departure."" Frank says this is a ""myth"" that protects Obama from anger at his mother. Stanley Renshon in Barack Obama and the Politics of Redemption, sees the President's political agenda as originating in his personal psychology. Renshon maintains ""that Obama has still not reconciled himself to his mixed race and cultural background"". Some of these diverging views can be clarified when examining how President Obama handled the economic and political challenges following the severe 2008 recession. Economic and political policy are central subjects of Ron Suskind's Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington, and the Education of A President. His account of how Obama functioned in the drive for health care reform diverges from Renshon's.

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Population-based sample residing in Hawaii. Subjects: Three hundred and eighty-four adults (36% Asian-American, 33% non-Hispanic white, 31% other/mixed race). Measures: A spatial model of the local food environment was constructed using radial buffers extending from participants' place of residence. Fruit and vegetable intake was estimated using the National Cancer Institute Fruit and Vegetable All-Day Screener. Analysis: Mean intakes of fruits and vegetables were compared for spatial access to total, healthy, and unhealthy food outlets at distances of .5 to 3.5 km. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate differences in fruit and vegetable intake for residing further from a food outlet or for residing in an area with a greater number of food outlets. Results: Residing in an area with a greater density of total or healthy food outlets was associated with a higher mean intake of fruits and vegetables (p < .05) at .5 km. No differences in mean intakes were detected for distances beyond .5 km or for regression models. Conclusion: Findings suggest that greater spatial accessibility to food outlets comprising the local food environment in Hawaii may not be meaningfully associated with fruit and vegetable consumption; however, associations were detected for the smallest spatial scale examined, warranting further investigation.

This dissertation examined mediated conversations on mixed race identity in response to some of the significant events in the Obama campaign and the first months of the Obama presidency. Specifically, this study examined the ways that newspapers and blogs construct discourses about race, mixed race, and racism. Further, I explored the biological, legal, and social implications as they relate to current constructions of mixed race identity. This dissertation centered the data collection around four pivotal discourses in the Obama era: (1) Obama's announcement of his presidential candidacy; (2) Obama's ""A More Perfect Union"" speech; (3) Obama's election to the presidency; and (4) the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Gates. The parameters of these pivotal discourses allowed me to focus on what bloggers say about the events and how the newspapers reported them. Ideological criticism and framing analysis guided my study on racial identifications and negotiations related to Obama from three newspapers: New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Chicago Sun-Times; as well as four blogs: Mixed Roots, Beige-World, Light-skinned-ed Girl, and Twisted Curlz. Three dominant frames emerged from the news coverage on the four discursive moments: race, dialogue, and history. I define the race frame as stories about the issues concerning race and racism; the dialogue frame as stories about a conversation, specifically at the national level; and the historical frame as stories about historic events. Three frames also emerged from the framing analysis of the blog posts: awareness, personalization, and racism. The awareness frame consists of postings about news and celebrity in mixed race community; the personalization frame as personal postings; and the racism frame as postings relating to issues concerning racism. Ideological criticism facilitated the analysis of the news articles and blogs and allowed me to uncover several ideologies about race and mixed race emerge from these discursive constructions. The newspapers perpetuated the invisibility of Whiteness, the Black and White binary, hybrid heroism, and the erasure of racism ideologies. The preference for Obama as President, the salience of mixed race matters, and promotion of anti-racist work are ideologies in the blogs. While the blogs and news articles are different in format, style and purpose, taken together they give a look at the ongoing conversation that impacts discourses on race, racism, and mixed race. The interpretation of the findings explains how the media I examined reveal the social construction of race, the rhetoric of race, and agenda setting in each of the discursive moments in order to discuss current conceptualizations of race in the United States. In addition to an in-depth interpretation of framing and ideological analyses findings, the theoretical and methodological contributions are discussed.

Chapter one considers the merits, strategies and limitations of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Critical Whiteness Studies (CWS) as pedagogical tools in higher education contexts. I demonstrate the ways in which monoracial foundations are imbedded in these two approaches and argue that, through a mixed-race analytic, theorists working in the field of CRT and CWS will be better able to analyze the dynamic interplay of race and racial categorizations in ways that benefit a broad spectrum of diverse students, including a growing multiracial student population. Building on this platform, chapter two highlights research data from a two-year qualitative case study in which one undergraduate group of ten multiracial students initiated, designed and implemented a college course. Here, I argue that these students developed a critical mixed race praxis through intentional, shared leadership, interdisciplinary content, and regular attention to a larger political agenda. Throughout the paper, I consider two central themes: (1) implications of a shared leadership model on college student development, and (2) practical lessons far organizational interventions in higher education pedagogy. The third paper shifts from student development to that of higher education administrators who seek to build organizational capacity for justice-conscious leadership. Building on the theoretical and empirical data in the previous papers, chapter three articulates a set of criteria by which to define and measure critical mixed race praxes. Through a series of vignettes located in higher education contexts, I highlight timely moments and opportunities for administrators to leverage their multiple subject positions in ways that inform and contribute to critical leadership practices. My analysis cautions against leadership and policy that rely on fixed identity politics to instead emphasize structural and organizational models as methodological tools for praxis.

The book draws us into a thought-provoking journey that engages readers with the key participants and their immediate and extended families. The main purpose of the book was to present an ethnographic longitudinal analysis of how white members of mixed-race families in the Midlands of the United Kingdom deal with race, racism, whiteness and racial identity. This book explores the thinking and the discourses of white women who have established families with black Caribbean men. The book begins with the introduction of two new theoretical concepts: racial literacy and ethnic capital. It goes on to describe how the women in the longitudinal study cope with racism, how their thinking about race and whiteness has been challenged and changed over time, how their whiteness can be viewed either as a social liability or as a source of injury to their families and how they raise their 'trans-racial' children to become racially literate.

Using Washington Circle criteria for treatment initiation and engagement, 76% of the sample initiated, with 59% engaging in treatment. Analyses used a 2-stage Heckman probit regression, accounting for within-site clustering, to identify factors predictive of initiation and engagement. Adolescents treated in a pay-for-performance (P4P) group were more likely to initiate, whereas adolescents in the race/ethnicity category labeled other (Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian, mixed race/ethnicity), or who reported high truancy, were less likely to initiate. Race/ethnicity groups other than Latinos were equally likely to engage. Among White adolescents, each additional day from first treatment to next treatment reduced likelihood of engagement. Although relatively high initiation and engagement rates were achieved, the results suggest that attention to program and client factors may further improve compliance with these performance indicators.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) For me, one of the influential ideas within the original Milan approach to family therapy was coined by Shands (1971), who advocated that we should strive to ""stamp out nouns"", and I think this could not be more appropriate than it is in this potentially volatile field of race and culture. If we see race and culture as ""nouns"", that is, fixed entities with attached meanings; we lose the potential to see them as pauses in ongoing conversations (Krause, 2002). It would be helpful to see terms such as black, white, or mixed race as pauses or stopping points in ongoing conversations about race. The conversations take place in particular contexts containing elements of the past and the future, but if they can be constructed in a dialogical format they acquire the ability to change and develop new meanings. I think we have an ethical responsibility, if we choose to become engaged in this topic, to keep conversations going. So, the focus of this chapter is how to introduce the topic of race and culture into dialogical processes.

As the children of Russian men and Aleut, Alutiiq, Tlingit, Dena'ina, Chugach, and Yupik women, some Creoles acted as intermediaries between both worlds, while others lived in either their mother's or father's communities. As the Russian American Company (RAC) transformed these mixed race offspring into a colonial labor force, the RAC and the Orthodox Church also sought to integrate them into Russian culture. For example, Orthodox missionaries somewhat unsuccessfully tried to implement marriages within the church, while the RAC endeavored to keep track of the number of births from these unions. The RAC and the Orthodox Church also educated the Creoles in order to supplement their ranks within Russian America; the RAC established schools so that they could train a company workforce, as the Orthodox Church used Creole clergymen to spread Christianity and Russian imperialism. While the Russians worked to assimilate the Creoles, their European colonial attitudes prevented the Creoles from truly becoming Russian and ensured their subordination throughout imperial rule. As a result, those Creoles who lived closest to the Russians were never completely assimilated into Russian identity and began to view themselves as a distinct non-European and non-indigenous society. Like mixed race populations elsewhere in the colonized world, the Creoles may have became their own nation had the United States not purchased Alaska in 1867. After the American acquisition, U.S. policies and prejudices splintered the Creoles into those who wanted to take advantage of the benefits of white society, those who re-entered Native American life, and those who kept relics of Russian culture alive.

Two studies examine how two status-related factors-race and social class-influence identity choice. While a majority of mixed-race participants identified as biracial in both studies, those who were members of groups with higher status in American society were more likely than those who were members of groups with lower status to claim a biracial identity. Specifically, (a) Asian/White individuals were more likely than Black/White or Latino/White individuals to identify as biracial and (b) mixed-race people from middle-class backgrounds were more likely than those from working-class backgrounds to identify as biracial. These results suggest that claiming a biracial identity is a choice that is more available to those with higher status.

Using data from three longitudinal samples of college-educated women, I assess relationships among personality, personal resources and health in women transitioning from midlife to older age, using three major metatheories to examine these issues: successful aging, personality development and stress and coping. The first two studies in this dissertation examine potential developmental correlates of successful aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1997), generativity and concern about aging, in three samples of women. The third study focuses on stress and coping as a model (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) that is widely used to predict mental and physical health at all ages. Mental and physical health are, of course, elements that are included in definitions of successful aging. Due to the evidence suggesting that stress and stress- related events compromise health and accelerate aging over the life course, I examine the direct effect of certain stressors, perceived discrimination and caregiving, and the potential influence of moderating personal resources (religiosity/spirituality and self-efficacy) on subjective health and successful aging in a mixed-race sample of college- educated women with varied social class backgrounds. The findings from the first two studies indicate that there is a consistent relationship between personality development and successful aging. While higher levels of generativity predict increased levels of successful aging in two samples, increased concern about aging is associated with lower levels of successful aging in all three samples. Findings from study three reveal that there is a significant inverse relationship between stress and both subjective health and successful aging. However, this relationship is moderated by personal resources, particularly self-efficacy. For women who reported low levels of personal resources, stress yielded a more negative impact than for those who reported higher levels of personal resources with the same burden of stress. Findings from this research suggest further work is needed to contextualize factors contributing to healthy aging outcomes. Future research should address how personality development and person-characteristics promote risk or resilience among adults entering older age.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Multiracials have the flexibility to opt out of multiracial identity, to shift identities depending on context, and are characterized by in-group diversity. Given this fluid space, how do multiracials come to see themselves as a collective? This article describes an empirical example of collectivization processes at work. Specifically, the author observed the process of collective identity-building through ethnographic research in a mixed-race student-run organization. This case study indicates that group identity formation is a negotiated process involving strategies to achieve a sense of belonging and cohesion. The author shows that over time, by using experiences of social conflict to construct shared experiences, the members of this mixed-race organization developed collective identity. In so doing, their experience underscores how collective identity development is socially constructed and how micropractices are essential components of group formation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Objective: To determine whether physicians who interact with their patients between office visits using secure messaging and phone provide better care for patients with diabetes when controlling for physician, patient and care center characteristics. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States. Participants: 174 Primary Care Physicians. Intervention: We modeled the relationship between communication via secure messaging or phone communication and Diabetes Recognition Program (DRP) scores with a Generalized Estimating Equations model. Covariates included physician age and panel size, patient age, race, income and number of comorbidities, and the population density around the care center. Main Outcome Measure: DRP scores. Results: Physicians whose patients were predominantly white or mixed race were more likely than other physicians to use secure messaging and phone with their patients between visits, but there was no significant association between such contacts and DRP scores (P > 0.1). In contrast, physicians with predominantly black or Hispanic patients had significantly higher DRP scores associated with the use of secure messaging (P < 0.01) and higher, though not statistically significant, DRP scores associated with the use of phone (P < 0.1). These associations were strongest for outcome measures such as HbA1c and lipid levels, and were weaker or nonexistent for process measures such as annual foot and eye exams. Conclusions: The use of secure messaging, and, to a lesser extent, phone, appears to be associated with higher quality diabetes care, particularly among at-risk populations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"We tested relationships between social connections, hope, and violence among young adolescents from socially distressed urban neighborhoods, and examined whether relationships between adolescents' family and school connectedness and violence involvement were mediated by hopefulness. Data were from middle school students involved in the Lead Peace demonstration study. The sample (N = 164) was 51.8% female; 42% African American, 28% Asian, 13% Hispanic, and 17% mixed race or other race; average age was 12.1 years; 46% reported physical fighting in the past year. In multivariate models, parent-family connectedness was protective against violence; school connectedness was marginally protective. Hopefulness was related to lower levels of violence. The relationship between school connectedness and violence was mediated by hopefulness; some evidence for mediation also existed in the family-parent connectedness and violence relationship. Findings warrant continued exploration of hopefulness as an important protective factor against violence involvement, and as a mediator in relationships between social connections and violence involvement.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This article examines how discourses of linguistic (in)competency regiment productions of citizenship in the South Korean popular media. Through an analysis of newspaper articles and television programs, we investigate how depictions of language competency become key resources for locating individuals within genealogies of kinship and chronotopic figures of personhood. In some cases, the speech of these celebrities associates them with imaginings of their backwards, low-class Korean kin, the Japanese colonial period, and American military presence, while in other cases, their language is associated with the 21st-century ideal of the modern, elite, globetrotting neoliberal subject. This analysis demonstrates how competence is read in relation to changing notions of citizenship in the new 'multicultural' Korea as these men are differentially positioned between multiple raced, classed, and gendered imaginings of Whiteness and Koreanness. More generally, we argue that understandings of linguistic competence are social productions, rather than reflections of language ability.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"We propose that hypodescent-the assignment of mixed-race individuals to a minority group-is an emergent feature of basic cognitive processes of learning and categorization. According to attention theory, minority groups are learned by attending to the features that distinguish them from previously learned majority groups. Selective attention creates a strong association between minority groups and their distinctive features, producing a tendency to see individuals who possess a mixture of majority- and minority-group traits as minority-group members. Two experiments on face categorization, using both naturally occurring and manipulated minority groups, support this view, suggesting that hypodescent need not be the product of racist or political motivations, but can be sufficiently explained by an individual's learning history.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This study examined the understanding of children's rights in 63 (9-, 11-, and 13-year-olds) mixed-race South African children and their mothers. In individual semistructured interviews participants responded to hypothetical vignettes in which children's nurturance and self-determination rights conflicted with parental authority in the home. Participants were required to decide whether they should support the story characters' rights and provide justifications for their responses. Findings indicated that both children and mothers were more likely to endorse children's nurturance than self-determination rights. In contrast to previous research, no significant differences were found between children and mothers in terms of support for either type of right. In terms of reasoning, both children's and mothers' responses revealed distinct patterns of thinking influenced by the type of right under consideration. The findings are discussed with reference to the available western and non-western literature on children's understanding of rights. Limitations, implications, and directions for future research are considered.

In the context of both Black and White faces, Study 1 revealed a graded pattern of bias against racially-ambiguous faces that was weaker than the bias to Black faces but stronger than that to White faces. Study 2 showed that significant bias was present when racially-ambiguous faces appeared in the context of only White faces, but not in the context of only Black faces. Study 3 demonstrated that context produces perceptual contrast effects on racial-prototypicality judgments. Racially-ambiguous faces were perceived as more prototypically Black in a White-only than mixed-race context, and less prototypically Black in a Black-only context. Conversely, they were seen as more prototypically White in a Black-only than mixed context, and less prototypically White in a White-only context. The studies suggest that both race-related featural properties within a face (i.e., racial ambiguity) and external contextual factors affect automatic evaluative associations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Models of face perception often adopt a framework in which faces are represented as points or vectors in a multidimensional space, relative to the average face that serves as a norm for encoding. Since faces are very similar in their configuration and share many visual properties, they could be encoded in one common space against one norm. However, certain face properties may result in grouping and ""subclassification"" of similar faces. We studied the processing of faces of different races, using high-level aftereffects, where exposure to one face systematically distorts the perception of a subsequently viewed face toward the ""opposite"" identity in face space. We measured identity aftereffects for adapt-test pairs that were opposite relative to race-specific (Asian and Caucasian) averages and pairs that were opposite relative to a ""generic"" average (both races morphed together). Aftereffects were larger for race-specific compared to mixed-race adapt-test pairs. These results suggest that race-specific norms are used to code identity because aftereffects are generally larger for adapt-test pairs drawn from trajectories passing through the norm (opposite pairs) than for those that do not. We also found that identification thresholds were lower when targets were distributed around race-specific averages than around the mixed-race average, suggesting that norm-based face encoding may play a functional role in facilitating identity discrimination.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background: Group drug counseling is the primary treatment modality used to treat drug dependence in community settings in the United States. Findings from the social psychology literature suggest that gender may influence how individuals participate in groups, and that race may moderate the effects of gender on group behavior. This study examined gender, race, and their interaction as predictors of alliance, participation, self-disclosure, and receipt of advice and feedback in drug counseling groups, and explored how gender and racial differences in drug counseling group behavior related to outcome of cocaine dependence treatment. Method: Ratings of group behavior were made from videotaped sessions of group drug counseling drawn from a randomized trial of treatment for cocaine-dependent individuals (n = 438). Analyses examined the effects of race (African American or non-Hispanic White), gender, and the race by gender interaction on group behavior. Additional analyses examined race, gender, and group behavior, and interactions among these variables in predicting monthly cocaine use. Results: Race and the race by gender interaction, but not gender alone, predicted many group behaviors. Non-Hispanic White women had the highest rates of self-disclosure and receipt of advice and non-positive feedback, followed by men of both races, with African American women having the lowest levels. These differences were unrelated to cross-sectional cocaine outcome. Conclusions: Women, but not men, of different races acted differently in mixed-race, mixed-gender cocaine treatment groups, with African American women exhibiting less of several behaviors. Additional research on causes and consequences of these differences could inform interventions for drug-dependent women.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This article examines the practice of marriage among whites, mestizos, blacks, Cubans, and Spaniards during the first constitutional era, focusing upon the reported ages of brides and grooms. The study consists of a quantitative examination of trends found in the records of 900 Catholic marriages celebrated in Havana during the opening decades of independence. The first major finding of the research is that according to most major indicators of status, age was negatively correlated with rank. Thus, contrary to the conclusions of studies conducted in many other contexts, those in the highest strata of society married younger. Furthermore, very significant differences were detected in the marital patterns of those identified as mixed-race and those labeled as black. This finding offers empirical weight to the notion that the early-mid twentieth-century Cuban racial structure would best be characterized as tripartite, rather than binary in nature.

YEAR: 2011",21322283,Empirical Study; Quantitative Study,"Again, as with men, the overall trend was positive for white women, women of color, and women with no recorded race. However, for the middle group, the increase in the timing of marriage was not proven to be statistically significant.
All tests in this section were ANOVAS of the log_age_difference.
ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni test using the log of age found whites, mestizos, and Chinese-born men to be statistically identical, as were men de color, negros, and men with no race.
As there were a number of outliers (i.e., people first marrying very young or very old), it is helpful to also consider the median as a measure of central tendency. The median age at marriage for all men was twenty-eight, and for women it was twenty-four. The modal age for men, or, the most frequent age at which they married, was twenty-six. For women it was twenty-three.
Because of my interest in the process of racial labeling, after much consideration, I decided classify brides and grooms strictly on the basis of the ascriptions used in the documents, rather than upon ancestry. Thus if a Spanish-born man was listed as blanco he fell into strata A. But if his race was omitted he fell into strata C. Rather than treating race as an objective, immutable ''fact,'' or imposing my own logic of race upon the data, I decided to try to make sense of the logics guiding scribes and priests working in local parishes in the previous century. Detailed discussion of the possible reasons for omissions of labels pertaining to race and to legitimacy in parish registers is found in my 2010 article, ''Each Sheep With Its Mate.''

Individuals wishing to contract marriage were required to certify their date of birth and ancestry by providing a record of their baptism. If they had not been baptized, or the baptismal record had been destroyed or lost (as was common following the independence war), then origins were to be certified on the basis of testimony from ''witnesses'' who had known the individuals for many years. This last means of ascertaining information would certainly have introduced the possibility of error.

Following convention, I differentiate between first and higher order marriages. A histogram of age revealed that the data was skewed to the left, thus runs were done using a transformed age variable log_age. In order to make the results easily interpretable, however, I report mean age, rather than means of the log of age, throughout. All significance levels are reported in conventional units of either.05,.01, or.001. The minimum level for statistical significance was set at.05. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was selected for means comparisons, followed up by Bonferroni post hoc tests where necessary. The means provided below are weighted, in accordance with the sampling technique employed during data collection. Further discussion of methods is found in Appendix A.

For men in each racial strata, the overall trend was also positive. Statistical significance was detected between the means over time for white men (sig F =.04) and for men with no recorded race (sig F =.01).
For men, the F statistic of an ANOVA comparing the mean log_age of these groups is quite large-57, and significant at.001. For women, the differences between the three groups are also quite significant (F = 38, significant at.001). Post hoc comparisons using Bonferroni tests reveal that differences between the widowed and the civilly married were not statistically significant, either for men or for women.
For persons of color, differences between the native-born and foreign-born were not found to be significant. This may have been due to the very unequal sample sizes and the fact that so few persons identified as mestizo or negro were foreign-born.

The Asian Ethnic Experience Today (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1998). Alternately we may ask, is there evidence to suggest that the construct of race was in fact a ''fluid continuum?'' Or were distinctions of color rigidly maintained and policed, in areas from employment to politics, schooling, recreation, and formal marriage?
I probe beneath the surface of this finding in my 2010 article, ''Each Sheep with Its Mate.''
In accordance with Spanish law, the majority of those born to unwed parents were classified as ''hijos naturales'' or ''natural children'' in their marital and baptismal records. Natural children were those whose parents had not faced a canonical or civil impediment to marriage at the time of birth, yet had not been married. Natural children might subsequently legitimated by the later marriage of their parents. Individuals classified using the Spanish term ''ilegitimo'' were far less frequently found in the documents. ''Hijos ilegitimos'' were children of parents who could not have contracted marriage at the time of birth, because one or both was married to someone else, had taken a vow of religious celibacy, or because the two were related within four degrees consanguinity. I discuss the social relevance of birth status in late colonial and early republican Cuba further in my article ''Each Sheep With Its Mate.''
In colonial era documentation, mixed-race Cubans were referred to as pardos and blacks as morenos. By the turn of the century, pardo gave way to mestizo, or mulato, and blacks became known as negros. I use the Spanish-term mestizo, rather than mulato, in the text above, in keeping with the terminology used in the church records upon which this study is based. It must be noted that in addition to the three over-arching racial terms, many other labels (such as blanconazo, jabao, trigueno, chino, indio, mulato claro, negro carbon, etc) referring to a multiplicity of phenotypes arrayed along the socially constructed ''continuum'' have long been recognized. For further discussion of racial terminology in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Cuba, see Enid L. Logan, ''Each Sheep With Its Mate: Marking Race and Legitimacy in Cuban Catholic Parish Archives, 1890-1940,'' New West Indian Guide/ Nieuwe West-Indische Gids 84, 1-2 (2010): 5-39; de la Fuente, A Nation for All; Ferrer, Insurgent Cuba; and Mark Q. Sawyer, Racial Politics in Post-Revolutionary Cuba (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006).
In early twentieth-century Cuba, the status distinction between manual labor and nonmanual labor in early twentieth-century Cuban society was a particularly important one. See de la Fuente, A nation for all, p. 154.
In the tables, summary measures of age are reported to one decimal place. Ages are rounded to the nearest half year in the text, however, to facilitate assimilation of the information.
In the weighted sample, 35 percent of grooms of color were classified as mestizo or pardo (mixed-race) and 26 percent as negro or moreno (black). The remainder were labeled de color-an ambiguous color term that could refer to Cuban blacks or mulattos. For further discussion of the varying using of racial labels in Cuban ecclesiastical records, see, again Logan, ''Each Sheep With Its Mate.''
It should be noted that the number of persons classified as illegitimate in the weighted sample is somewhat below their representation in the general population. According to the census data, the average rate of illegitimacy in the period under study for the province of Havana was 17 percent. Thus, it appears that illegitimacy depressed the likelihood of marriage.

Researchers have found that immigrants often marry later than the native-born. Often, those who emigrate are able to do so because they did not marry in the home country. Male immigrants also marry later because of the additional time needed to establish themselves financially. Immigrants of both sexes may additionally be forced to postpone marriage due to a shortage of available partners in their adopted country. See Elwood D. Carlson, ''The Impact of International Migration Upon the Timing of Marriage and Childbearing,'' Demography 22, 1 (1985): 61-72 and Robert Lee, ''Urban Labor Markets, In-Migration, and Demographic Growth: Bremen, 1815-1914,'' Journal of Interdisciplinary History 30, 3 (1999): 437-73.

Such issues have been debated by Peter Wade, Blackness and Race Mixture: The Dynamics of Racial Identity in Colombia (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993); George Reid Andrews, Blacks & Whites in Sao Paulo, Brazil, 1888-1988 (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 1991); Carl Degler, Neither Black nor White: Slavery and Race Relations in Brazil and the United States (New York: MacMillan, 1971); Winthrop Wright, Cafe con leche: Race, Class, and National Image in Venezuela (Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 1990); Helg, Our Rightful Share; Ferrer, Insurgent Cuba; de la Fuente, A nation for All, and others, for countries across Latin America. While Helg makes the strong claim that ''Cuba's social construct of race... differs from the three-tier or multitier racial systems prevailing in many countries of the region and tends to show a two-tier racial system similar to that of the United States'' (p. 3), Ferrer, on the other hand, believes that the question may not be worth answering at all. She writes, ''Sometimes people and institutions drew distinctions between blacks and mulattos (as in pardo and moreno) and sometimes they did not... even in cases in which multiple lines existed, they were not always observed. Sometimes historical protagonists drew multiple lines, sometimes one, and sometimes (more rarely) they drew none'' (p. 21).
The age gap for women with no reported race was 4.8 years. However, it was not determined to differ statistically from either of the two other groups.
There were forty recorded marriages of white men to women of color and sixteen recorded marriages of men of color to white men. Out of a total of 12,106 marriages between 1901 and 1940 in the two parishes, this is.46 percent.
There were no women classified as amarilla in the study population.
These figures are averages from the five censuses. The rate of marriage among Cubans of color doubled between 1899 and 1919, from 6 percent to 13.5 percent, where it stayed more or less the same through 1943.
This includes all men-born in Cuban, Spain, or elsewhere-categorized as blanco.

Thus, the designation AA would be give to the marriage of a man and a woman who were both labeled as white. AB included the few formal marriages between white men and women of color (who might be described as negra, morena, parda, or mestiza). Strata BB included all non-white spouses, in any combination. Strata BC referred to the marriages of men of color to women with no listed race.
Twentieth-century marital records contained a great deal of information. They began with the date of inscription of the register, the date of the ceremony, and the location of the wedding. The records then listed the name, place of birth, age, and marital status of the groom (single, widowed, or civilly married to the bride), his race, place of residence, and birth status (usually ''legitimate'' or ''natural''). Marital registers continued with the groom's profession and the names and birthplaces of his parents. Next was information pertaining to the bride-name, place of birth, age, marital status, race, and place of residence. Following that were her birth status and parents' names and places of origin. After the 1920s, some records also provided the bride's occupation-which was usually listed as ''su casa'' (''homemaker''). Married couples had godparents-male and female, for whom often only names were given-as well as official witnesses. The witnesses were almost always both male, and marital registers provided their place of birth, profession, civil status, and place of residence, or some combination of this information.
Using an ANOVA to test the effect of race on log_age_women, the overall F was 22, significant at.001.
When Cuba's final war of independence ended in 1898, the island was immediately transferred from a colony of Spain to an occupied territory of the U.S. military. The first Cuban constitution was ratified in 1901 and inaugurated the following year, when the island formally gained its independence. The first constitutional era spanned some four decades, until the ratification of the progressive constitution of 1940. For discussion of this historical period see for example, Enid L. Logan, ''The 1899 Cuban Marriage Law Controversy: Church, State and Empire in the Crucible of Nation,'' Journal of Social History 42 (2008): 469-94.
While data on occupation is provided for 93 percent of men, it is offered for only 1 percent of women.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Jeffrey Passel surveys demographic trends and projections in the U.S. youth population, with an emphasis on trends among immigrant youth. He traces shifts in the youth population over the past hundred years, examines population projections through 2050, and offers some observations about the likely impact of the immigrant youth population on American society. Passel provides data on the legal status of immigrant youth and their families and on their geographic distribution and concentration across the United States. He emphasizes two demographic shifts. First, immigrant youth-defined as those children under age eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents-now account for one-fourth of the nation's 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children. Second, the wave of immigration under way since the mid-1960s has made children the most racially and ethnically diverse age group in the United States. In 1960 Hispanic, Asian, and mixed-race youth made up about 6 percent of all U.S. children; today that share is almost 30 percent. During that same period the share of non-Hispanic white children steadily dropped from about 81 percent to 56 percent, while the share of black children climbed very slightly to 14 percent. By 2050 the share of non-Hispanic white children is projected to drop to 40 percent, while that of Hispanic children will increase to about one-third. This changing demographic structure in U.S. youth is likely to present policy makers with several challenges in coming decades, including higher rates of poverty among youth, particularly among foreign-born children and children of undocumented parents; high concentrations of immigrants in a handful of states; and a lack of political voice. A related challenge may be intergenerational competition between youth and the elderly for governmental support such as education funding, Social Security, and government health benefits. In conclusion, Passel notes that today's immigrants and their children will shape many aspects of American society and will provide virtually all the growth in the U.S. labor force over the next forty years. Their integration into American society and their accumulation of human capital thus require continued attention from researchers and policy makers.

A sample of 300 students between 14 to 19 years old was selected, of which 107 were Wixaritari indigenous and 193 were mixed race from the north of Jalisco, Mexico. Assessed variables were knowledge about HIV/STI, locus of control for the HIV infection, concern about HIV/STI and attitudes towards condom use. Statistically significant differences based on gender were found, in the variables internal locus of control, attitudes towards condom use and knowledge about HIV/STI. We did not find differences in the variable concern about HIV/STI. Wixaritari indigenous adolescents, regardless of gender, are exposed to a higher level of risk of HIV infection than mixed race adolescents. It is necessary to keep on researching about other variables that could intervene in preventive behavior in indigenous population, and make HIV prevention programs suitable for the population.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Marital isonymy is frequently used to estimate inbreeding and the repeated pairs method is useful to investigate whether the population under examination has subdivisions. These methods can also be applied to registers, such as population censuses, where both spouses' surnames are noted. In this paper, the 1795 census for Cordoba province is analysed. Numerically speaking, Spanish and mixed-race people are the major ethno-social groups in the register. In order to estimate inbreeding, the isonymic method was applied to both groups, at provincial and at parish level. To appreciate to what extent the parishes were genetically isolated, Wright's Fst was also calculated. The repeated pairs method was also used for both groups to assess if population subdivision existed in the units under study. Finally, to evaluate whether the subdivision based on surnames reflected the ethno-social stratification, the same method was used considering the two groups together. At the provincial scale, both groups displayed low inbreeding and micro-differentiation, although the former was higher for the Spanish and the latter for mixed-race groups, which could indicate a more marked conjugal selectivity in the Spanish. At the parish scale, preferences for isonymic spouses were not pronounced either in Spanish or in mixed-race groups; in the Spanish group population subdivision prevailed, with the opposite occurring in the mixed-race group. The estimations from repeated pairs, taking the two groups together, indicated that for the studied populations the surnames do not allow the two groups to be differentiated into isolated reproductive units.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Objective: Explore how urban and rural Minnesotans access the food system and to investigate whether community infrastructure supports a healthful food system. Design: Eight (4 urban and 4 rural) focus groups were conducted. Setting and Participants: Eight counties with urban influence codes of 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10. Fifty-nine (urban, n = 27; rural, n = 32) adults. The sample was of mixed race and had a range of incomes. Almost half of the sample was obese. Main Outcome Measure: Food systems access and the role of community infrastructure, civic engagement, and reciprocal relationships in food provisioning in counties with different urban influence codes. Analyses: Themes and subthemes were identified through emerging concepts. Results: Food access varied based on rurality and community infrastructure. Three themes emerged: community infrastructure around the conventional food system and food provisioning, alternative food resources, and perceptions of the effect food and of the influence diet and exercise have on health. Conclusions and Implications: Civic engagement and community infrastructure affected food access. Rural residents rely more on retail grocery stores, gardening, hunting, and informal food exchange systems, whereas urban residents rely more on the retail grocery stores and food safety net systems. Hunting and gardening may contribute valuable nutrients to the diet.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This article explores the contrasts between the flexibility and openness of interethnic and diasporic identifications and the fixity of class distinctions in contemporary Britain. The author draws on fieldwork conducted in the Midlands area and a suburban town in the south east of England and traces the ways in which project participants mobilised their biographies and ancestries to express feelings of empathy and relatedness across black, white and Asian identities. The author discovered the same people articulated a strong sense of classed distinction between themselves and others who were thought to lack respectability, social ambition and mobility. These observations have led me to reflect upon the theoretical contrasts between what Stuart Hall has famously called 'new ethnicities' and what the author calls 'old classities'.

We integrated an evidenced-based motivational interviewing (MI) approach with a social network component to develop a 20-minute session, a social network intervention delivered in an MI-consistent style. Female adolescents (N = 28) 14 to 18 years old were recruited, provided consent/assent, were screened, and were randomly assigned to the treatment or control (no treatment) condition. The sample was 82% African American and 18% mixed race, with 32% living below the U.S. poverty line. At 1-month follow-up, teens in the treatment condition reported less trouble due to alcohol use, less substance use before sexual intercourse, less social stress, less offers for marijuana use, and increased readiness to start counseling compared with the teens in the control condition. Results provide support for socially based brief interventions with at-risk urban adolescents.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) American Indians occupy a singular position in U.S. society, unlike that of any other racial or ethnic minority group, by virtue of having been the first people to occupy the land that is now the United States. Their unique relationship with the federal government has grown out of a long history of conflict and struggle. This unique relationship stems from the fact that in the early history of the United States, American Indians were not considered a part of the nation. From 1790 to 1871, the federal government dealt with American Indians much as it would with foreign nations, using a mixture of diplomacy, treaties, and warfare. By the late nineteenth century, the federal government had successfully overwhelmed American Indians' military resistance and had turned to the task of assimilating them into modern society. The campaign to assimilate American Indians lasted throughout much of the twentieth century. However, the failure of these efforts, combined with increasing American Indian opposition, led the federal government to abandon them in the 1960s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the federal government gradually replaced the old assimilationist policies with new ones that allowed self-determination. Despite their special status, American Indian/Alaska Natives are among the poorest of the poor in the United States. And like other disadvantaged groups in the nation, a disproportionate number of American Indian/Alaska Native children live in homes at the very bottom of this hierarchy. The subject of this essay is twofold. One is to outline the social and economic position of American Indian/Alaska Native children relative to other, better-known groups, namely Whites and African Americans. These two groups represent polarities of privilege in American society, and juxtaposing American Indian/Alaska Native children against them is a means for gauging more clearly their position in American society. However, to fully understand the place of American Indian/Alaska Native children, it is especially important to understand who is being depicted as an American Indian or Alaska Native in statistical data from sources such as the Decennial Census. As the data presented below will show, there are at least two ways that data for American Indians can be presented and, indeed, they depict two rather distinct communities: one is a mixed race, mostly urban, and less disadvantaged group, and the other group is poorer, more rural, and less inclined to identify with any other race than American Indian or Alaska Native. If there is a single lesson that can be taken away from this essay, it is the remarkable diversity that exists within the population of people who represent themselves as American Indian/Alaska Natives. The complexity of the American Indian/Alaska Native population makes broad generalizations difficult. Yet this complexity underscores the vibrancy and diversity of Native communities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The purpose of this study was to examine low-income mothers' perceptions of their children's height and weight in relation to actual measures, and perceptions of dietary quality and health status. Demographic, anthropometric, and dietary quality/health status data were collected during a multi-phase nutrition research project with low-income Minnesotans, and a sub-set of non-pregnant mother-child dyads (mothers ages > 18 years, children ages 9-13 years) were analyzed (n = 257). Participants were Caucasian, African American, American Indian, Hispanic, Asian, or Other/mixed race, and most were homeless. Relationships between maternal perceptions of their child's height and weight and the actual measures, and maternal perceptions of dietary quality and health status for the dyad, were examined using independent and paired samples t-tests, ANOVA, and paired samples correlations. Comparisons were also made by maternal and child body mass index (BMI) status and living situation. Mothers significantly underestimated their child's height and weight (-4.8 +/- 13.9 cm, P = 0.000; -5.3 +/- 8.5 kg, P = 0.000); greatest misperceptions of weight were among mothers of overweight/obese children (P = 0.000). Mothers not reporting estimates of their child's height and weight (n = 53) had higher BMIs (P = 0.029), and their children were younger (P = 0.000) and lighter (P = 0.021) compared to mothers who provided estimates. Inability to objectify children's weight status may contribute to the obesity epidemic affecting low-income minority populations. Underestimation of weight status may be influenced by cultural perceptions of body image and socioeconomic status.

Such studies, however, have been based on very small stimulus sets. The current study investigated perceived attractiveness and personality for 600 Black, White and mixed-race faces. Many of the investigated personality traits were correlated with race when rated by White participants. Attractiveness specifically was greater for Black male faces than White male faces and among mixed-race faces. Blackness correlated with increased attractiveness. A reverse pattern was found for female faces with Whiteness being associated with attractiveness. The results are discussed in terms of the sexual dimorphism demonstrated in skin color.

Authored Book",,,"(from the book) According to the most recent U.S. census, twice as many black men are involved in interracial relationships aft black women. Do black women consciously resist such involvement? What motivates the relatively few women who are in these types of relationships? And how do they navigate the unfamiliar terrain in intimacy? One of the most popular explanations for black women's involvement in interracial intimacy is the unavailability of eligible black men. This explanation focuses on the dismal statistics popularly discussed in reports that forecast lonely futures for African American females. Craig-Henderson explores another, more provocative explanation. She argues that some black women may disassociate from larger social stereotypes by consciously and strategically making choices that distance them from what is considered characteristic of the ""typical"" African American woman. Scant serious attention has focused upon intimate interracial relationships, perhaps because of a general reluctance to deal with two extremely provocative issues: race and sex. As rates of interracial relationships continue to increase, discussions about interracial intimacy are relevant and timely. Craig-Henderson considers the continuing taboo of interracial relationships involving African Americans, the way this taboo is changing, and the way that contemporary race relations perpetuate longstanding stereotypes about race and sex. The book includes in-depth, unstructured interviews with a wide range of black women currently involved in interracial intimate relationships. Each individual discusses their relationships with family members, beliefs about the influence of race in America, unique problems associated with interracial intimacy, as well as sexual attraction, racial identity, and children. Of particular interest to specialists in race, gender, family, and sexual issues, this work is also accessible and appealing to general readers.

Authored Book",,,"(from the cover) This book explores changing American views of race mixing in the twentieth century, showing how new scientific ideas transformed accepted notions of race and how those ideas played out on college campuses in the 1960s. In the 1930s it was not unusual for medical experts to caution against miscegenation, or race mixing, espousing the common opinion that it would produce biologically dysfunctional offspring. By the 1960s the scientific community roundly refuted this theory. Paul Lawrence Farber traces this revolutionary shift in scientific thought, explaining how developments in modern population biology, genetics, and anthropology proved that opposition to race mixing was a social prejudice with no justification in scientific knowledge. In the 1960s, this new knowledge helped to change attitudes toward race and discrimination, especially among college students. Their embrace of social integration caused tension on campuses across the country. Students rebelled against administrative interference in their private lives, and university regulations against interracial dating became a flashpoint in the campus revolts that revolutionized American educational institutions. Farber's provocative study is a personal one, featuring interviews with mixed-race couples and stories from the author's student years at the University of Pittsburgh. As such, Mixing Races offers a unique perspective on how contentious debates taking place on college campuses reflected radical shifts in race relations in the larger society.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This article maps my journey as a scholar engaged in the research of youth morality (located in the Global South); as a beneficiary of injustice having grown up as a white South African; as a navigator of complex personal histories (discovering my mixed race family origins); and arriving at restitution as a career research focus. It reflects on the experience of being turned inside out through examining personal and political locatedness in moral research and how these change as new discoveries are made. It also explores feelings of professional exclusion despite being the recipient of a privileged Northern hemisphere education and shows how the topic of restitution addresses some of the inherent tensions in my personal life, whilst offering potential for redemptive North-South partnerships. Moreover, researching restitution in global contexts of moral injustice, across the Global North-South divide, has the potential to expand the internationalisation of scholarship on morality and moral education.

Specifically, the study examines the impact of participants' exposure to the one-drop rule in the U.S., by which racial identification has been historically determined by the existence or non-existence of black forebears. Employing qualitative data collected through both focus group and face-to-face semi-structured interviews, the study analyzes mixed-race Jamaicans' encounters in the U.S. with racial boundaries, and the boundary-work that reinforces them, as well their response to these encounters. Through their stories, the dissertation examines participants' efforts to navigate racial boundaries through choices of various racial identifications. Further, it discusses the ways in which structural forces and individual agency have interacted in the formation of these identifications. The study finds that in spite of participants' expressed preference for non-racialism, and despite their objections to rigid racial categories, in seeking to carve out alternative identities, they are participating in the boundary-making of which they are so critical.

Results from the principal components analysis using data from a web-based sample of 185 multiracial individuals with Asian and White descent yielded a five-factor simple structure of the Biracial Experiences of Discrimination Inventory (B-REDI): Biracial Response to Monoracial Context (6 items), Racial Microaggressions (6 items), Confusion of Interracial Family Relations (4 items), Assumptions of Marginality (3 items), and Internalized Multiracial Racism (3 items). Initial evidences of internal reliability, convergent validity and known-groups validity were found. An evaluation of internal consistency suggested that the B-REDI reflected dimensions of multiracial racism and supported initial evidence of the reliability of the five factors that emerged. In support of convergent validity, multiracial experiences of discrimination were positively correlated with perceived general ethnic discrimination, Asian American racism-related stress, a universal-diverse orientation, awareness and acceptance of others similarities and differences, as well as awareness, sensitivity, and receptivity towards racial diversity and multiculturalism. Also in support of convergent validity, multiracial experiences of racism were negatively correlated with colorblind racial attitudes. Evidence for known-groups validity was demonstrated through statistically significantly higher levels of multiracial experiences reported among multiracial individuals with Asian and White descent (n = 184) than monoracial individuals (n = 325). However, multiracial individuals with Asian and White descent (n = 184) did not report multiracial experiences of racism at a statistically significantly higher level when compared to multiracial individuals of other ethnic backgrounds (n = 263). This finding suggests that having a mixed race background may represent a factor that exerts an overall greater impact compared to the specific ethnic group make-up of an individual. Study limitations as well as research and clinical implications are discussed.

The data in this study are drawn from a national longitudinal survey, Your First College Year (YFCY), from 2004-2005 and includes mixed race Black and Asian students in comparison to their single race Black and Asian single race peers to explore interpersonal self-concept. The results suggest that mixed and single race Asian and Black students have different pre-college and first year experiences. Only mixed race Black students were found to develop a significantly higher interpersonal self-concept after their first-year than their single race peers. However, most importantly for mixed and single race students are their interactions with diverse peers. For all groups, both negative and positive interactions based on race within the college environment directly impact interpersonal self-concept. First-year college experiences (Positive Ethnic/Racial Relations, Racial Interactions of a Negative Quality, Leadership Orientation, Sense of Belonging, Campus Racial Climate, Self-Assessed Cognitive Development) were the most significant contributors to the development of an interpersonal self-concept in comparison to pre-college experiences. The slight differences between Black and Asian interpersonal self-concept are discussed. The findings in this study expand the literature on multiracial college students and provide empirical evidence to support institutional practices that aim to promote a positive interpersonal self-concept in the first college year.

The children of wealthy, white fathers and both free and enslaved women of color, many left for Britain in order to escape the deficiencies and bigotry of West Indian society. This study traces the group's origin in the Caribbean, mainly Jamaica, to its voyage and arrival in Britain. It argues that the perceived threats of these migrants' financial bounty and potential to marry and reproduce in Britain helped to collapse previous racial distinctions in the metropole which had traditionally differentiated along class and status lines and paved the way for a more monolithic racial viewpoint in the nineteenth century. This study makes three major contributions to the history of the British Atlantic. First, it provides a thorough examination of the West Indies' elite population of color, showing its connection to privileged white society in both the Caribbean and Britain. Those who moved to the metropole lend further proof to the agency and influence of such individuals in the Atlantic world. Second, it expands the notion of the British family at the turn of the nineteenth century. Through analyses of wills, inheritance disputes, and correspondence, this project reveals the regularity of British legal and personal interaction with relatives of color across the Atlantic, as well as with those who resettled in the metropole. Third, it allows for a material understanding of Atlantic racial ideologies. By connecting popular discussions in the abolition debate and the sentimental novel to biographical accounts of mixed-race migrants, British notions of racial difference are more strongly linked to social reality. Uncovering an entirely new cohort of British people of color and its members' lived experiences, this dissertation provides crucial insight into the tightening of British and Atlantic racial attitudes.

Key objectives were to determine the most significant predictors of engagement in screenings for breast cancer and being in a more advanced stage of change for such behavior (i.e. action or maintenance stages) A convenience sample (N=106) of women between the ages of 18 to 65 years with a mean of 38.49 years (SD= 12.28) completed the online Breast Cancer Screening Survey. Women were mostly African American (n=67, 63.2%), followed by White-non Hispanic (n=21, 19.8%), Hispanic (n=9, 8.5%), Asian (n=2, 1.9%) and Mixed Race/Ethnicity/Other (n=7, 6.6%). Nearly 47.2% of participating women (n=50) were single, 30.2% (n=32) were married and with higher education (i.e. associates degree, n=26, 24.5%; masters degree, n=30, 28.3%). Mean income was $61,544 with a majority employed (70.8%, n=75). The study women engaged in healthy behaviors mostly ""sometimes"" (i.e. portion control, physical activity, moderate alcohol use), possessed self-efficacy for performing breast self-examination in a fair to moderate range, were mostly in an action stage for engagement in screening behavior, and had poor to fair breast cancer knowledge. There were no detectable differences between African American and non-African American respondents on the study measures. A backwards stepwise regression predicting being in a more advanced stage of change for engaging in breast cancer screenings (i.e. action or maintenance) showed that the best predictors were women being older in age and having higher self-efficacy for performing breast self-examination (with an adjusted R square of .182, such that 18.2% of the variance was explained by the two independent variables). A second regression predicting being in a more advanced stage of change for breast self-examination (i.e. action or maintenance) showed that the best predictor was higher self-efficacy for performing breast self-examination (with an adjusted R Square of .129, such that 12.9% of the variance was explained by this independent variable). Implications and future recommendations for research emphasize the importance of health educators and researchers focusing on modifiable risks for breast cancer, such as healthy behaviors (e.g. physical activity) and self-efficacy to perform them.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"I use multiple perspectives on the racial order in the United States to generate hypotheses about the social position of mixed-race groups. Perspectives that view the racial order as binary, ternary with an undifferentiated middle, or ternary with a stratified middle present different expectations for the social position of multiracial groups. I use a group's level of residential segregation as an index of social position. In 2000, multiracial persons lived in neighbourhoods that were more white than the neighbourhoods of single-race minorities, though more diverse than the neighbourhoods of whites. Thus, multiracial groups appear to occupy an intermediate social position relative to blacks and whites, a finding that supports contemporary arguments about shifting colour-lines in the United States and the emergence of a triracial system of stratification. Yet, findings also suggest that the social space between blacks and whites is, itself, racially stratified.

The FTM spectrum includes people who were assigned a female sex at birth and currently identify as male, transgender, third gender, genderqueer, or/and gender variant. FTM spectrum people of color in the U.S. are impacted by racism, transphobia, family members, and their ethnic communities. Through open ended interviews, twelve API FTM spectrum individuals describe their experiences with coming out, API gender roles, family support, experiences within transgender and API communities, the impact of stereotypes, privilege, and the availability of relevant resources. The participants reported that they knew they were male or on the FTM spectrum from ages ranging from four years old to in their twenties after meeting other transgender FTM people, especially other FTMs of color. The participants reported experiences of racism within the predominately White FTM community and discussed the impact of invisibility of API spectrum people. Although the participants described receiving support from the few available resources for FTM people of color, they also reported that there are currently no resources dedicated to addressing the specific needs of FTM spectrum individuals of API descent. Half of the participants in the study were officially out about their gender to their parents, and half were not. Of the participants who were out to their parents, half were mixed race with non-API races. The majority of the participants who were out reported that they had supportive parents, however not all parents were immediately supportive. The participants who were not out stated that they felt their parents would not be able to understand the concept of transgender and gender variant identities. They also reported the lack of any available resources for the family members of API FTM spectrum people, such as pamphlets in Asian languages and culturally specific support groups. Although some of the participants were not officially out about their gender identities, all of the participants noted ways in which their families were supportive of their gender presentations. Demonstrated parental support included lack of pressure to wear women's clothing as well as purchasing and handing down men's clothing. Clinical implications based on these interviews are discussed in detail, and suggestions for further avenues of research are offered.

Drawing upon approaches to cultural industries, critical studies of global marketing and market segmentation, cultural theories of globalization, performance studies, and Latin American and Latino/a studies, it examines how those practices affect the company's depictions of Mexican, Mexican-American, and Latino/a cultures produced for advertisers and television audiences. Exploring sales meetings and events, integrated (in-program) advertising and media convergence, and programming practices, I analyze how this cross-border network delineates those cultural identities. I critically examine how the network has contributed to the transformation of Mexican cultural identities via the global circulation of television and advertising. Hence, this dissertation speaks about the role of transnational media in the reconfiguration of national identities and in the politics of race, class, migration, and belonging. To carry out this research, I conducted interviews, obtained public and private industry and network materials, and acted as participant-observer at various settings in Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles. The dissertation argues that Azteca's practices articulate ideologies about cultural identity and citizenship. In Mexico, TV Azteca has disseminated unorthodox treatments of national politics, gender, and sexuality. But because it targets the metropolitan, white and mestizo (mixed race) upper and middle classes, the company reinforces class, ethnic, racial, and regional hierarchies. Across the border, Azteca America has contested the U.S. Spanish-language television industry's homogenous pan-ethnic paradigm: the network has been pursuing Mexicans in the first instance, while creating secondary programming for the broader Hispanic audience. Azteca America, however, promotes both its immigrant and U.S.-born Mexican audiences paradoxically as cultural foreigners and domestic consumers. Transnationally, Azteca circulates a hybrid Mexican culture that expands national identity beyond rigid categories and that occasionally critiques sociopolitical disenfranchisement of Mexican Americans and immigrants. While the primary focus is on Azteca's business practices, the dissertation also considers how advertising clients, television performers, audiences, new media users, and citizens negotiate their participant roles with the network. These contexts of consumer-citizen participation and protest challenge the authority of Azteca and its clients to define Mexican and Mexican-American cultural identities. Still, much of the network's practices privilege the participation of its clients, and this transnational media corporation retains vast control over its screen images and how it shapes cultural representations according to its sales and marketing priorities.

High risk behaviors such as alcohol and drug use, and poor decisions relating to health and wellness are the outcome of decades of negative perceptions of self brought on by the lateral violence of colonialism. This research demonstrates how different determinants of First Nations identity (legal and policy based, social and culturally based definitions, and the self-identification ideology) interplay and influence a sense of authenticity which informs self-worth and the ability to realize health and wellness for twelve First Nations women on Manitoulin Island. First Nations identity is multi-layered and for women who only have one First Nations parent, and who often have Bill C-31 Indian status, identity becomes complicated and painful. Using life histories, the research participants demonstrate that an authentic identity is difficult to navigate because of the stigmatization they feel by non First Nations people for being a First Nations woman, and also the lateral violence they experience in their communities for being ""bi-racial"", not growing up on their reserve, not knowing language and culture, and often having either Bill C-31 Indian status or no status at all. The medicine wheel is used to explore this topic and a Nanabush story provides the context to understand it.

Edited Book",Chapter,Handbook/Manual,"(from the chapter) A majority of theory and research on racial and ethnic identity has focused on a single racial or ethnic group (mono racial); yet demographic trends clearly point to a growing population of individuals who represent two or more racial heritages. In chapter 26, the author reviews writing and research on biracial and multiracial identity. The chapter presents a new model of multiracial identity developed and tested by the author. The author introduces readers to her comprehensive theory of multiracial-heritage awareness and personal affiliation. This theory is based on a thoughtful integration of qualitative research on biracial identity development. The development and validation of the Multiracial-Heritage Awareness and Personal Affiliation Scale is also summarized.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Despite the often cited idea that racial identities are socially constructed, and potentially fluid, much public policy is still based on surveys that elicit only one measure of racial identity. A number of U.S. studies have employed ""best single race"" questions on racial identification, in which multiracial respondents are asked to choose only one race to describe themselves. We extend some American studies by examining responses to a ""best single race"" survey question posed to a small sample of multiracial young people in Britain. In-depth interviews with British multiracial respondents are employed to investigate the extent to which a ""best single race"" (BSR) question captures someone's sense of attachment and belonging to a particular ethnic or racial group. In particular, we focus on how we should interpret East Asian/white respondents' choice of ""white"" as their BSR.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"'Mixed' people comprise one of the fastest growing populations in Britain today, and their growth refutes the idea that there exist distinct, 'natural' races among people in multiethnic societies, such as Britain. In recent years, a large body of scholarship, both in the US and Britain, has begun to investigate the diverse social experiences and racial identifications of mixed people. In this article, I investigate the ways in which mixed siblings perceive and think about race and differences in racial, ethnic, and religious identification within their families. What role do race and the recognition of difference play in sibling relationships and in family life more generally? I draw upon a small number of cases to illustrate the diverse ways in which understandings of race, ethnicity, and religion are (or are not) regarded as important in these families. I also consider whether there are group differences in terms of how disparate types of mixed siblings may perceive pressures to identify in particular ways.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The present research capitalized on the prominence and multiracial heritage of U.S. 2008 presidential election candidate Barack Obama to examine whether individual differences in classifying him as Black or as multiracial corresponded to differences in implicit perception of race. This research used a newly developed task (Sedlins, Malahy, & Shoda, 2010) with digitally morphed mixed-race faces to assess implicit race perception. Participants completed this task four times before and one time after the election. We found that people who labeled Obama as Black implicitly perceived race as more categorical than those who labeled Obama as multiracial. This finding adds to the growing literature on multiracial perception by demonstrating a relationship between the explicit use of multiracial and monoracial race classification and implicit race perception. The results suggest potential implications for governmental, educational, and judiciary usage of racial categories.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Data are presented from the Baltimore Young Men's Survey, a cross-sectional, venue-based sample survey of risks associated with HIV and report of a prior HIV test, conducted between 1996 and 2000, and enrolling 843 young men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 15-29 years. HIV prevalence was 12.1% overall and racial disparities in HIV prevalence were pronounced (range, 2.9% among non-Hispanic whites to 27.1% among non-Hispanic blacks). Risks independently associated with being HIV-positive were: being between 26 and 29 years of age, being non-Hispanic black or of other/mixed race, having had 20 or more lifetime male sex partners, having been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD), and not being currently enrolled in school. The majority of participants (78.9%) reported a prior HIV test. In multivariate analysis, being older, having had five or more lifetime male sex partners, having had anal intercourse with males, reporting an STD diagnosis, and reporting recent unprotected anal sex were associated with report of a prior HIV test. Prevention efforts must address high HIV prevalence among young non-Hispanic black MSM and must make testing and effective counseling for young MSM readily available.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Although multiple race responses are now allowed on federal censuses and surveys, most interracially married single-race parents report a single race for their children. It is well-established that the social context of these racial identification decisions affects their outcome. This research focuses instead on the physical context. It is argued that homelands-physical places with cultural meaning-are an important component of the intergenerational transfer of a single-race identity in indigenous mixed-race families. To test potential explanations for the relationship between homelands and indigenous identities, this research focuses on families in which an interracially-married American Indian lives with a spouse and child and was included in the Census 2000 5% Public Use Microdata Sample. Logistic regression reveals a strong effect of living in an American Indian homeland on the child's chances of being reported as single-race American Indian. This effect remains even after accounting for strong ties to American Indians and other groups, family and area poverty levels, geographic isolation, and the racial composition of the area. The intergenerational transmission of strong identities continues in this multiracial era (as it has for centuries) in the context of culturally meaningful physical places.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background/Context: One of the most critical functions of a well-integrated school is the development of ""culturally flexible"" students who, over the course of their social development, effectively navigate diverse social environs such as the workplace, communities, and neighborhoods. Most studies, albeit with some exceptions, have investigated the impact of desegregation on short- and long-term gains in achievement and attainment, as opposed to its impact on intergroup relations. Mixed-race schools are vital not only for bolstering achievement outcomes of previously disadvantaged students but also for promoting social cohesion in a diverse society. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Specifically, this article examines the difference in cultural flexibility between black and white students enrolled in schools with different racial and ethnic compositions. Cultural flexibility is defined as the propensity to value and move across different cultural and social peer groups and environments. Furthermore, this article provides some insight into how students in different mixed-race and desegregated educational contexts experience their school's social organization and cultural environments, which influence their interactions and academic behaviors. Setting: The study was conducted over a 6-month period in four high schools: a majority-minority school and a majority-white school located in a northeastern city, and a majority-minority school and a majority-white school located in a southern city. Research Design: Survey data were gathered from a randomly stratified sample of 471 Black and White students attending. In addition, ethnographic notes from weeks of school observations and transcribed interview data from 57 group interviews conducted in the four schools with students in Grades 9-12 complemented the survey research. Data Collection and Analysis: Findings reveal significant associations among self-esteem, academic and extracurricular placement, and cultural flexibility for black students. Also, black students in majority-minority schools scored significantly higher on the cultural flexibility scale than those in majority-white schools. Among white students, regional location and academic placement showed statistically significant associations with cultural flexibility. The ethnographic and interview data further explicate why these patterns occurred and illuminate how certain school contextual factors are likely linked to students' cultural flexibility. Overall, this study's findings highlight some connections between student and school behaviors as they pertain to both students' and educators' willingness and ability to realize the visions of racial and ethnic integration wholly.

Little scholarship has been given to the portrayal of mixed race individuals on the big screen. In this book, the focus of the different chapter authors is on ethnic ambiguity, interracial relationships, mixed race individuals, and ethnic heritage and how these have been projected in films and TV over the past 70 years. In one way or another most chapters discuss how racial stereotypes and crossings of racial boundaries are seen by the larger society and how these have been portrayed over time by Hollywood. This is an interesting book for scholars seeking information on how Latinos have been cast in movies over the past seven decades.

Edited Book",Chapter,Handbook/Manual,"(from the chapter) There is a growing number of mixed-race people in the United States and a growing number of individuals who identify as mixed-race or multiracial. In the last census, 6.8 million people identified as multiracial, marking more than one racial category to identify themselves or their children, with 42 percent under 18 years of age (Jones & Symens Smith, 2001). The ""biracial baby boom"" of the 1970s and 1980s produced a notable cohort of multiracial individuals (Bratter, 2007) and resulted in an increase in the number of mixed-race individuals from 500,000 in 1970 to nearly 7 million in 2000 (Krebs, 2000; Shih & Sanchez, 2005). Given this growing population, mental health practitioners will likely be working with increasing numbers of multiracial individuals (Kerwin, Ponterotto, Jackson, & Harris, 1993); thus, it is important for therapists and counselors to have an awareness and knowledge of the experiences of this population and to be able to transfer this awareness and knowledge into skills useful in working with multiracial individuals. Competent, ethical multicultural practice requires understanding and addressing the unique characteristics and mental health needs of this population. This chapter will provide the reader with guidelines and resources for increasing awareness of one's own values and attitudes, knowledge of ecological issues related to people of mixed ancestry, and skills in developing competency in working with persons of mixed ancestry. Case studies are included and will be referred to throughout the chapter to illustrate critical concepts. Pouse & Ponder exercises will be included throughout the chapter to prompt the reader to stop, reflect, and engage in a more contemplative and dynamic way with the concepts in this text, thus increasing personal awareness and recognition of multicultural issues as they relate to people of mixed ancestry (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","multicultural counseling, cultural competency, multicultural therapy, mixed ancestry, mixed race, multiracial","*Competence

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Norms determine regular patterns of behavior and influence members' identification with a group. They are also a proximate way to predict and understand behavior in diverse work groups but, surprisingly, have not been extensively examined in this context. After reviewing research on group norms and the psychology of prejudice, I suggest that reaping the benefits of the increased range of available task relevant resources in demographically diverse work groups may depend on the strength and content of the norms it adopts, but that diverse groups face distinct obstacles in developing strong norms that create satisfying interpersonal interaction and effective work performance. I consider the difficulties diverse work groups have in forming strong norms and then focus on how anti-bias norms, which are directed toward preventing behaviors associated with prejudice and discrimination and address members' security concerns, and openness norms, which promote people's ability to individuate those whom they might otherwise stereotype as well as address nurturance concerns, may increase a work group's ability to optimize social interaction and performance amidst diversity. I suggest that reorienting psychological and organizational research on prejudice to focus on group norm strength and content may be a way of both understanding and solving the greater challenges of discrimination.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"South Africa is a remarkable mosaic of human society on the most Southern tip of Africa. Here, in an area roughly eight times the size of Belgium, live some 30 million people, comprising Whites, Coloreds (persons of mixed race), Asians and no fewer than 10 indigenous African tribes, of which the Zulus is the largest. The population is not only diverse, but it is also exploding. In the past two decades, the population has more than doubled from 13 million in 1964 to its present 30 million. New levels of education are opening new career horizons for a large percentage of our people, but virtually the whole population is experiencing economic changes. In this dynamic environment where change is the order of the day, the organization development (OD) consultant in South Africa has a task which can only be described as very exciting. Our consultancy has been in existence since 1979. In the past five years (possibly the period of greatest change), we have been fortunate enough to become involved in many projects which have a direct bearing on the conditions of social, political and economic change in our society. We should like to share with you our involvement in a number of these areas. Our new constitution is giving additional political rights to many persons of coloured origin who have as yet only had political experience at local government level. In a country as diverse as South Africa, sound industrial relations systems are essential. It has also been proved that the approach to industrial relations in South Africa should be unique and not a duplicate of similar systems in the UK, Europe or the US, mainly due to its cultural composition and the many migrant workers from bordering countries. OD practice in South Africa is in an early phase and we are proud of our involvement in the development of OD practitioners and in the establishment of a network of OD practitioners in South Africa. For three years we have presented a program for internal OP consultants, consisting of six modules, extending from March to November each year. It is abundantly clear that the situation in South Africa today offers challenges to the organization practice (OP) consultant which are unique in the Western World. To be successful in this field and to make a constructive contribution as behavioral scientists we are dependent upon continuous interaction between ourselves and our colleagues in other countries.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Brazil's extensive Atlantic coastline has profoundly influenced the nation's history, serving as the initial locus for colonial settlement, and, subsequently, the site for almost all its major cities. Rio de Janeiro has long been the nation's dominant international tourist destination. While Carnival remains the city's most popular event, Reveillon, the New Years Eve celebration on Copacabana beach in honor of the sea goddess, Iemanja, has become a major tourist draw. A familiar personage in Brazilian popular culture, Iemanja is a major deity in African-Brazilian religions. African and African-Brazilian beliefs, historically associated with lower class and mixed race peoples, were long scorned by Brazilian elites as the superstitious practices of ignorant people. The majority of practitioners of African-Brazilian religions in contemporary Brazil are lower class and visibly of mixed race. The Reveillon evokes and com modifies Brazil's preferred national image as a multicultural, multiracial democracy free of the Western stain of racism. As such, the celebration serves as a confirming ritual for Brazilians while, at the same time, packaging and presenting that image to tourists.

However, it is unclear whether the risk identified in adolescence persists into adulthood. The current study uses data from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey to analyze the alcohol and tobacco use of multiracial adolescents and adults compared to European American, African American, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander American, and Latino American individuals. Results generally support the hypothesis that multiracial adolescents and adults face higher rates of substance use than African American and Asian/Pacific Islander American individuals, though this pattern of results was reversed in comparison with Native Americans and European Americans, and less consistent compared to Latino Americans. We further establish and discuss the correlates of drinking and smoking behavior for mixed-race individuals-comparing them to other racial groups. We review the limitations of our design and the implications for future research on multiracial substance use.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Male circumcision (MC) prevents HIV acquisition in males, leading to calls for extensive implementation in sub-Saharan Africa. The widespread adoption of male circumcision will require social marketing targeted at various families and family members. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the utility of conjoint analysis in the choice of social marketing strategies tailored to different populations to promote male circumcision in Johannesburg, South Africa. Seven social marketing strategies for MC were identified through open-ended interviews (n = 25). Preferences were assessed using conjoint analysis, implemented in a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected households. An oversampling strategy ensured balance between Blacks (34%), Coloreds (mixed-race; 32%), and Whites (34%). Respondents randomly received a block of 4 conjoint analysis tasks comparing 2 mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsets of the 7 strategies. Preferences were then evaluated using logistic regression stratified by ethnicity and family member. Whereas all strategies were attractive, television marketing, endorsement by church/school leaders, and a countrywide program were most preferred (p < .0001). Stratified analyses identified heterogeneity, e.g., only Coloreds valued radio (p < .0001) and a lasting presence in the community (p < .0001). Within families, mothers and sons were most concordant for Blacks (p < .05) and Coloreds (p < .01), but fathers were most concordant with sons among Whites (p < .05). Conjoint analysis provides valuable insight into preferences and can be used in the development of social marketing, especially when aimed at promoting behavioral change.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"In contemporary British society, references to 'mixed race' people and to various forms of mixing abound. But to what extent can we say that there is 'a' mixed race group in Britain today? If such a group exists, what commonalities underlie the experience of being mixed? In addressing this question, I draw on a study of the racial identifications of different types of mixed young people in Britain. I find that the meanings and significance of race and mixedness in these young people's lives can vary considerably both across and within specific mixed groups. In conclusion, I argue that while there is evidence of a growing consciousness and interest in being mixed, we cannot (yet) speak of a coherent mixed group or experience in Britain.

The research sample was comprised of 12 mixed-race Asian-White Americans between the ages of 16 and 23 years, 7 females and 5 males. They represent a variety of Asian-White mixes: 4 Japanese American-White; 3 Chinese-White or Chinese American-White; 2 Filipino American-White; 1 Japanese-Chinese-White; and 1 Hawaiian-Spanish-Filipino-Chinese-White. Biracial Asian-Black individuals were excluded due to the well-documented American tendency to classify mixed-race individuals of Black descent as ""Black."" The participants were drawn from two sources, a book of interviews conducted and compiled by Pearl Fuyo Gaskins entitled, What Are You? Voices of Mixed-Race Young People, and a ""fictional autobiography"" by Kip Fulbeck entitled, paper bullets. Participants were chosen to represent a broad spectrum of Asian descent, geographical location, age, and gender. The first-person accounts were analyzed using a qualitative method devised by Carol Gilligan and colleagues, the Listening Guide Method. The method was modified by employing a tabular sorting of themes identified in the various stages of analysis dictated by the Listening Guide Method. The findings indicated several shared themes that impacted the participants' process of racial identification. Key findings included sensitivity to other racial minorities, experiences of exoticization and objectification, not fitting in, racial pride, and experiences of racism. These in turn contributed to the participants feelings of anger toward the majority White culture, pain at not fitting in to this culture, ""invisibility,"" or lack of recognition by the majority culture, and having an unclear sense of self. Based on data from well-being studies, multiracial Asian American identity development models, and the results of the current analyses, the study concluded that exposure to a reference group of multiracial Asian-White individuals is a critical contributor to the development of positive racial self-view. The study acknowledges that experiences of racism, marginalization, and invisibility negatively impact identity development in mixed-race Asian-White adolescents, and that clinical interventions should include exposure to Asian-White reference groups.

Decades of research have shown that social categorization often elicits stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. Social perception is complicated by the fact that people have multiple social identities and self-categorization with these identities can shift from one situation to another, coloring perceptions and evaluations of the self and others. This dissertation provides evidence that self-categorization with a novel group can override ostensible stable and pervasive racial biases in memory and evaluation and examines the neural substrates that mediate these processes. Experiment 1 shows that self-categorization with a novel mixed-race group elicited liking for ingroup members, regardless of race. This preference for ingroup members was mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex-a region of the brain linked to subjective valuation. Participants in novel groups also had greater fusiform and amygdala activity to novel ingroup members, suggesting that these regions are sensitive to the current self-categorization rather than features associated with race. Experiment 2 shows that preferences for ingroup members are evoked rapidly and spontaneously, regardless of race, indicating that ingroup bias can override automatic racial bias. Experiment 3 provides evidence that preferences for ingroup members are driven by ingroup bias rather than outgroup derogation. Experiment 4 shows that self-categorization increases memory for ingroup members eliminating the own-race memory bias. Experiment 5 provides direct evidence that fusiform activity to ingroup members is associated with superior memory for ingroup members. This study also shows greater amygdala activity to Black than White faces who are unaffiliated with either the ingroup or outgroup, suggesting that social categorization is flexible, shifting from group membership to race within a given social context. These five experiments illustrate that social perception and evaluation are sensitive to the current self-categorization-however minimal-and characterized by ingroup bias. This research also offers a relatively simple approach for erasing several pervasive racial biases. This multi-level approach extends several theories of intergroup perception and evaluation by making explicit links between self-categorization, neural processes, and social perception and evaluation.

Students in the HealthWise school with the greatest involvement in teacher training and implementation fidelity reported increased intrinsic and identified motivation and decreased introjected motivation and amotivation compared to students in control schools. These results point to the potential for intervention programming to influence leisure motivation among adolescents in South Africa and represent a first step toward identifying leisure motivation as a mediator of program effects.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This article examines variation in the social position of mixed-race populations by exploiting county-level variation in the degree of occupational differentiation between blacks and mulattoes in the 1880 U.S. census. The role of the mixed-race category as either a ""buffer class"" or a status threat depended on the class composition of whites. Black/mulatto occupational differentiation was greatest where whites had high occupational prestige and thus little to fear from a mulatto group. Furthermore, differentiation increased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively low status and decreased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively high status.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Multiracial individuals are in the unique position of being able to categorize themselves as members of multiple racial groups. Drawing on self-categorization theory, we suggest that similarity to the minority ingroup depends on self-perceptions of physical appearance and connectedness to the minority ingroup. Moreover, we argue that similarity to the ingroup determines self-categorization as minority, which predicts category-based entitlements such as perceived eligibility for minority resources (e.g., affirmative action). Using path analysis, we found support for this model on a convenience sample of 107 mixed-race minority-White participants. The results suggest that affective processes rather than observable characteristics such as prototypical physical appearance better predict self-categorization among mixed-race individuals.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Children Who Wait is the report of a study that was commissioned by the Association of British Adoption Agencies following concerns about the number of children in local authority care waiting for permanent families. The study sought to understand the reasons why so many children in local authority care were waiting for permanent families. Their study was concerned only with children in long-term care under the age of 11 and living apart from their parents. At the time of the study there was a cultural adjustment to the diminishing numbers of babies available for adoption. The study indicates that a larger proportion of children in residential care had parents who objected to foster care. One of the factors which determined a decision for children to remain in foster or residential care was the difficulty in placing sibling groups, children from ""black"" or ""mixed race"" families, and the view that, through adoption, children should lose all contact with their biological families. The authors also described the effect of changes of social worker on children, saying that 80% of the children had a change of social worker within a two-year period. Social work needs to be more valued and have the resources needed to draw on existing knowledge to ensure that they are able to meet the needs of children who are waiting for them to act.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, Black Beauty: Aesthetics, Stylization, Politics by Shirley Anne Tate (2009). This book seeks to counter representations that depict black women as 'dupes of patriarchy and racism' who lack beauty agency and 'yearn for whiteness'. This book maintains that through stylization black women are 'expanding the boundaries of what counts as black beauty', rather than 'inscribing a white aesthetic onto their bodies'. The book argues that 'Black mixed race' women use fake tan to become 'browning'. While their behavior mimics that of white people who wish to be brown, she suggests that the young women do not want to be white, rather, through fake tanning they 'radically revalue dark skin positively' and subvert 'the colonial priority of ""race"" in which white was right'. Perhaps the most controversial points the book makes are about skin bleaching. The book challenges the tendency for black women's beauty work to be automatically associated with a desire to be white. The book also problematizes the invisibility of politics in white women's beauty work and urges readers to consider the 'race' work inherent in white women's beauty practices. The concludes that a non-essentialist, inclusive black politics is required that 'disrupts white supremacy's light skin privilege which seeks to place darker-skinned, kinkier-haired women outside of beauty itself'.

How race, gender, education, and years of experience as a counselor affect measures of attitude and knowledge was also explored. This study examined the attitudes and knowledge of practicing counselors who work with biracial and multiracial populations. Two measures of attitudes and knowledge were administered to 165 counselors from a large regional mental health program treating minority populations. The AMCS is an assessment measure used in this study to garner counselor's self-reported attitudes towards multiracial youth. In addition to the AMCS, the researcher developed a tool for measuring levels of knowledge for working with biracial youth, entitled the Multicultural Counseling Vignette (MCV). Frequencies for both measures are reviewed. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the nature of the relationship between the four subscale scores on the AMCS and the scores on the MCV. A hierarchical regression was used to examine the relationships between total scores on the MCV and the respondents' race, gender, education, and experience. Results indicated that counselors generally have ambiguous attitudes towards working with multiracial youth. This ambiguity may be-the result of lack of awareness of constructs related to mixed race youth, or possibly a reflect on of the uncertainty about mixed races in general in American society. Dependent variables showing significance for higher levels of knowledge for working mixed race youth were gender, race, and level of education. Suggestions, implications, and directions for future research are offered.

Through analysis of U.S. and South Korean government records, archival documents, mainstream and minority press, and interviews with Korean wartime orphanage employees, this dissertation focuses on the living legacies of a ""forgotten war."" It traces the roots and routes of Korean and mixed-race adoptee and war bride immigration that were intimately shaped by ordinary Americans at work in South Korea between 1950 and 1965, and the complex political, social, and legal effects that this gendered and raced immigrant group had upon both countries. This dissertation argues that the U.S. servicemen, missionaries, social workers, and voluntary aid workers, the latter three that flooded South Korea to spearhead the postwar recovery campaign, advocated for the legal and binding formation of mixed Korean/American families and brought empire home. Ironically, by adhering to its government's cultural policy of integration intended to bolster U.S. expansionist and Cold War efforts, enthusiastic internationalist citizens tethered Americans at home to South Koreans in sentimental, material, and, eventually, familial ways that unraveled the government's ability to contain its neocolonial objectives ""over there."" Thus, by being American, U.S. citizens profoundly affected both sides of the Pacific-they forever changed the lives of thousands of Korean women and children, permanently shaped South Korea's child welfare system, and unexpectedly forced openings in U.S. national and familial borders subsequently challenging Americans at home to broaden their conceptions of race, kinship, gender, sexuality, and national belonging during the tumultuous Cold War/civil rights era. 1I borrow the title from a magazine article covering the arrival of Korean adoptee, Lee Kyung Soo; Jon Brenneis, ""A New American Comes 'Home'"" Life, November 30, 1953, 25-29. 2In the 1950s, popular media problematically described the children born from U.S. servicemen and Korean women as ""GI babies.""

Non-White multiracial students have been ignored. The relevant past studies have rejected the ""marginal man"" theory as an explanation for the academic outcomes of multiracial students, but have not proposed an alternative framework. This dissertation examines three school-related domains: academic performance and its presumed causes, peer attitudes about school and schoolwork, and students' connections to school. It includes non-White mixed-race students and tests a theory of enhanced access rather than marginalization. The starting assumption is that, compared to their monoracial peers, multiracial students will have access to resources from each group in their heritage, resulting in different outcomes in their school lives. Using survey data from a national sample of 29,621 single-race and 2,122 mixed-race students in grades 7 through 11, I first contrasted eight groups of students, four monoracial (Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White) and four multiracial (Asian-White, Black-Hispanic, Black-White, and Hispanic-White). On the academic measures, the part-White biracial students often did better than the monoracial students from the non-White group in their heritage and the non-White multiracial students. However, on the peer attitude and school connection variables, the racial groups were more similar. When socio-economic home resource and parental factors were added to the model, many of the academic differences between part-White students and monoracial students from their non-White background group were reduced or eliminated, as were differences between White and non-White monoracial students. These socio-economic factors had little effect on racial comparisons on the peer attitude and school connection variables. Thus, the academic ""advantage"" of whiteness observed for part-White multiracial students and White monoracial students was at least partially attributable to school-relevant resources accessible to them through their home environments. On homework measures, whiteness was a disadvantage for Asian-White students associated with doing less homework than their Asian peers. The relative academic success of Asian students appeared to be linked not to class but to doing homework.

This study considers the possibility that, rather than their White ancestry accounting for their position of status; it was, instead, their Black identity that pulled them toward leadership. The years immediately following the Civil War provided increased opportunities for Black leadership. For example, P.B.S. Pinchback, who was near-White in appearance, became the first Black governor of Louisiana. In 1877, when the last federal troops withdrew from the South, Reconstruction-era leaders did not simply drift into obscurity. Rather, they shifted their focus from political representation, toward property ownership and entrepreneurial pursuits. Other former Reconstruction-era activists looked overseas for opportunities to lead. At the turn of the twentieth century, when the U.S. redefined itself as a potential Imperial power, Black foreign diplomats, in order to extend American interests abroad, held positions in Haiti, Cuba, Hawaii, the Philippines and Vladivostok, Russia. During the Progressive Era women like Victoria Earle Matthews, E. Azalia Hackley, and Josephine Willson Bruce gained national prominence, as a result of their work in racial uplift. Had any of these individuals chosen to pass as White, the record of their lives would be lost among a host of other middle or upper-class Whites. My research finds that for many mixed-race people, a Black identity, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, offered positions of power, upward mobility, and notoriety. In essence, blackness became a way up rather than a way down.

Interracial marriage became legalized in part, because African-American soldiers and German women married in post-war Germany, where laws against such unions had been abolished, at a time when twenty-two states banned interracial marriage in the United States. Black soldiers and German women fraternized at an intersection of both American and German History which not only allowed such social relationships, but encouraged them. The relative racial progressiveness of bureaucrats in the War Department and later the Department of Defense meant that the American military acted as an unwilling agent in the legalization of mixed-race marriages. This occurred not only because the military's relative racial progressiveness made military service an attractive career option for young African-American soldiers, but its need to move its members around during the Cold War put it at odds with local racial laws. The first two chapters of this dissertation follow the development of German laws regarding those of African descent before World War II. In particular, it covers debates on interracial marriage and citizenship concerning the native inhabitants of Germany's African colonies, and the children of German women and French African soldiers following World War I. The third chapter and fourth chapters deal with policies that affected the African-American experience in the military prior to and during the occupation of Germany. Central to these chapters are the roles played by bureaucrats in the War Department who sought and won racially progressive policies for the military. The fifth and sixth chapters examine how these policy changes affected African-American soldiers and German women both in Germany and the United States. The emphasis is social history, or making the policies personal.

Vol.70(10-A),2010, pp. 4067.",978-1-109-41034-1,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,,"This dissertation is a study of student race relations on a university campus and tests the opportunity hypothesis in a university setting. Research has determined that students benefit most from interactional diversity (i.e. ongoing and meaningful contact across race lines) in areas such as critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and improved self-concept. While scholars agree on the benefits of interactional diversity, there has been limited research on the most effective ways to facilitate it. The literature suggests that students living in racially diverse residence halls are more likely to interact cross-racially than students living in predominantly White residence halls. An additional factor that contributes to students' experiences on campus is the college classroom. Research suggests that students exposed to diversified curriculums and an active pedagogy, regardless of the course content, exhibit higher levels of academic achievement, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, civic participation, and cultural awareness. Most importantly, for the purposes of this study, research has shown that opportunities for interaction in the classroom have proven to contribute to interactional diversity outside of the classroom. Using Michigan State University as a case study, this dissertation aims to identify the patterns and settings that promote and deter interactional diversity in a campus setting by focusing on the role of residence halls and classroom environment in students' interactions across race lines. A 10-minute online survey was developed and distributed to all undergraduate students currently living in a residence hall on the campus of Michigan State University (n=13,935) between November and December 2006. The primary dependent variable for this study was the Interactional Diversity scale-a 10-point scale that addresses the frequency with which respondents engaged in a variety of activities with students of different racial backgrounds (alpha=.916). Survey participation was representative, and results are generalizable, to the on-campus population of undergraduates at Michigan State University. This research led to several key findings: (1) Levels of interactional diversity differ significantly between racial groups. Levels of interactional diversity among White students were more easily influenced than for other students. Among students of color, Black students were the least likely to engage in interactional diversity. Mixed Race students were the most likely to engage in interactional diversity. This finding is a new contribution to the literature which has largely excluded this population of students. (2) From this study is that levels of interactional diversity are significantly affected by first-year roommates for all students. This is especially true for White and Asian students who are more likely to engage in interactional diversity if their first-year roommate is not someone that they requested and of a different racial background. (3) Results confirm that the classroom is a critical component of the interactional diversity puzzle. The Classroom Experience scale in this dissertation-which accounts for both curriculum and pedagogy-proved to be a significant predictor of interactional diversity for all students. The implications of these findings are discussed. The limitations of this study and suggestions for future research are also outlined.

I suggest that mixed race has been largely under-theorized in current racial and multiracial research and argue that this deficiency, as well as the controversies that mixed race often inspires, is an effect of the limitations in discourses about race, racism and identity. Throughout, I address many of the challenges, questions and controversies surrounding racial mixture (including struggles over identity, classification and the recent multiracial movement), and engage stories depicting experiences of mixed race people in Canada. I focus most closely on Lawrence Hill's Black Berry Sweet Juice: On Being Black and White in Canada, Carol Camper's anthology Miscegenation Blues: Voices of Mixed Race Women , and Shanti Thakur's documentary Domino. I use their stories as a means of commenting on broader struggles around racialization, racial identities, and racial discourse in our present multicultural context - one that is increasingly placing unbalanced focus on ideals of colour-blindness and neo-liberalism. My study is meant to inspire a re-thinking of some key concepts in contemporary theories of race and mixed race and the growing societal claims that we are moving toward a raceless state. The issues and questions I raise in this dissertation are intended to address the problems and concerns that many critical theories of race and mixed race fail to consider. I argue that creolization theory, particularly Edouard Glissant's theory of ""Relation"", his attention to rhizomatic identity, and his challenge to linearity and fixity, offer a critical challenge that might move complex discussions of mixed race and multiracial theory forward and away from the restrictions of binaries, racial biologism, and essentialist identity politics.

However, lost in these discussions are the different nonwhite interracial hybridities that did and continue to inhabit Chinese immigrant and Chinese American lives. This study offers a departure from dominant scholarly conversations that reproduce the master narrative of Chinese immigrants coming to the United States, building the railroads, and assimilating just enough to become what white America has termed the ""model minority"" and shifts the analysis and conversation to look at other experiences, opening up a racial narrative that situates Chinese bodies in proximity to black and nonwhite America. In applying theoretical perspectives from race and ethnic studies, history, visual culture studies, and immigration studies to examine a broad range of texts, I have discovered that Chinese men using racial passing as a tool to cross American borders illegally, Gold Mountain frontier experiences that included significant contact with Native people, husbands and fathers refusing to bow to greater community pressures and disown their black wives and mixed race children in the Mississippi Delta region, and the presence of Chinese women of African descent in local California Miss Chinatown beauty pageants all suggest that how Chinese people saw themselves racially and continue to see themselves was and is more complex and fluid than the master narratives depict and many Americans appear to believe. Beyond the Railroad People contributes to the growing field of Asian American studies by establishing a dialogue between counter-hegemonic discourses and works that give agency and voice to various Chinese Americans whose lived racial realities that included kinship with nonwhite Americans complicate what it means to be Chinese, immigrant, or American. This dissertation also intervenes in the field of American Studies by expanding how we gauge the many ways race, power, and agency shape bodies, relationship, communities, and national identities in the United States.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Theorizing on segmented assimilation has usefully spurred debate about the experiences and positions of the second generation in the US and, more recently, Europe. This theory has focused primarily on how young people fare in secondary school and the crucial role that families and ethnic social networks can play in supporting second-generation individuals. But what happens when young people leave home and enter into mainstream higher education institutions? Theorizing on segmented assimilation does not address either the implications of intermarriage for integration and upward mobility or how we should conceptualize the experiences of the growing numbers of 'mixed race' individuals. In this paper, I first consider the question of whether intermarriage is linked with upward mobility in the British context. I then explore the racial identifications and experiences of disparate types of mixed race young people in Britain. How do such young people identify themselves, and what may their identifications reveal about their sense of belonging in Britain?

We evaluated risk of fetal death for mixed race couples compared with same race couples and examined the role of prematurity and low birth weight as potential mediating risk factors. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using data from the 1998-2002 California Birth Cohort to evaluate the odds of fetal death, low birth weight, and prematurity for couples with a mother and father who were categorized as either being of same or different racial groups. Risk of prematurity (birth prior to 37 weeks gestation) and low birth weight (<2500g) were also tested to see if the model could explain variations among groups. Results: The analysis included approximately 1.6 million live births and 1749 stillbirths. In the unadjusted model, compared with two white parents, black/black and black/white couples had a significantly higher risk of fetal death. When all demographic, social, biological, genetic, congenital, and procedural risk factors except gestational age and birth weight were included, the odds ratios (OR) were all still significant. Black/black couples had the highest level of risk (OR 2.11, CI 1.77-2.51), followed by black mother/white father couples (OR 2.01, CI 1.16-3.48), and white mother/black father couples (OR 1.84, CI 1.33-2.54). Virtually all of the higher risk of fetal death was explainable by higher rates of low birth weight and prematurity. Conclusions: Mixed race black and white couples face higher odds of prematurity and low birth weight, which appear to contribute to the substantially higher demonstrated risk for stillbirth. There are likely additional unmeasured factors that influence birth outcomes for mixed race couples.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Comment/Reply,,"Comments on an article A Critique of Exchange Theory in Mate Selection by Michael J. Rosenfeld (2005). The article of Rosenfeld is one of the more serious and well-thought-out attempts to criticize the hypothesis, both theoretically and empirically. Rosenfeld concludes that simple and complex approaches both refute status exchange. He further claims that homogamy rather than exchange is the most important educational mating pattern in mixed-race couples. Explaining this discrepancy is important since the article by Rosenfeld may have given readers the false impression that complex models and simple models should always lead to the same findings. Loglinear models have often been difficult to interpret for the less technically oriented reader, as Rosenfeld correctly observes, and their complexity may have alienated part of the audience that was originally interested in the topic of intermarriage. Rosenfeld argues that it is important to take account of differential educational homogamy depending on race. If this is what Rosenfeld means by saying that these couples are based on solidarity and affection, he is probably right. But this does not translate into equally strong or stronger levels of educational homogamy-homogamy is weaker in these couples.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The purpose of this paper is to explore what it means to be mixed in Latin America and the Caribbean and to ask if mixing in the 'South' can always be understood within the so-called racial continuum as opposed to the racial binary of the 'North'. I do this through a comparison of two potentially mixed-race identities, the afro-indigenous Garifuna of Honduras and peoples of East Indian and African mixture (douglas) in Trinidad. Through this comparison I show that in both Honduras and Trinidad classification of mixed-race peoples can follow the logic of the racial binary or of the racial continuum depending on the historical context and the particular mix. I also discuss the way that mixed-race identities can sometimes be radical critiques of state racial projects of pluralism and at other times they can be the basis of state racial projects meant to obfuscate racial pluralism.

Methods: A cross-sectional interview survey of a random sample of 100 incarcerated women at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) in Cranston, Rhode Island, was conducted. Results: Participants were 62% white, 11% African American, 13% Hispanic, and 14% of mixed race. Mean age was 35 years. Of those surveyed, 67% reported having had a Papanicolou (Pap) smear in the past year, the strongest predictor of which was having received a Pap smear while incarcerated. Of the inmates >40 years old, 58% reported having had a mammogram in the past 2 years. The majority (88%) reported testing for STIs in the past, and 39% desired testing during their current incarceration. As for hepatitis C, 70% had been tested previously and 37% of those reported testing positive. Hispanics were less likely than whites to have been tested for hepatitis C (OR 0.1). Over half (54%) of the women who reported testing positive for hepatitis C also reported having completed the hepatitis A and B vaccine series. Among smokers (80% of all survey participants), 61% were interested in quitting. Those who had been incarcerated multiple times were less likely to want to quit smoking (OR 0.1). Conclusions: Incarceration presents a unique opportunity to provide preventive healthcare to high-risk, medically underserved women.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(create) As he took the stage with his family on election night, the crowd rose in unison in Grant Park in Chicago. Many will never forget that image of the first African American striding to the podium to deliver his presidential acceptance speech before 250,000 joyful and tearful souls. Barack Obama had just been elected the 44th president of the United States. Older members of the crowd uniformly expressed their disbelief: ""I never thought I would ever see in my lifetime a black man elected to be president of the United States."" Despite what appeared to be overwhelming odds when he announced his candidacy for president 21 months earlier, Barack Obama had ascended to the most powerful position in the world. Many of the elders in the crowd had witnessed the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King on their grainy black and white television sets in 1968. They had seen news clips of Bull Connor and his police attack dogs in Birmingham, Governor George Wallace blocking the schoolhouse door to desegregation at the University of Alabama, Rosa Parks's refusal to be seated in the rear of the bus, the Watts Riots, and civil rights marches on Washington in the late 1960s. It's no wonder they couldn't conceive of Obama's ascent to power that night, a man who represented a culture and a race that had been oppressed since the origins of North American slavery in 1619. As biographers write of Obama's life, the term ""resilience"" will emerge as a predominant characteristic that helped carry him to a position of prominence on the world stage. Pundits will offer their opinions about how his sense of determination shaped his personality. They will reread and analyze Obama's books Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope in order to gain insight into the part of his personality that provided him with a venue for overcoming all odds. Obama clarifies in his autobiographical works the many struggles and obstacles facing a young man of mixed race without a father. In many ways, Obama's overall life serves as a symbol of the successful negotiation of cultural, racial, and gender dilemmas that young men confront on their path to adulthood. Obama's story symbolizes resilience at its best. This chapter discusses challenges in counseling young men, strengths-based approach to psychotherapy with adolescent boys, understanding a father's absence, crossing the bridge into manhood, and the audacity to believe.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"We aimed to assess prevalence and correlates of hazardous use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs in a primary care population in Cape Town, South Africa. Stratified random sampling was used to select 14 of the 49 clinics in the public health sector in Cape Town, and every ""nth"" patient, with those ages 18-25 oversampled (N=2,618). Data were collected from December 2003 through 2004, using the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test. Hazardous use of tobacco was most common, followed by alcohol and then other drugs. Hazardous tobacco use was associated with the 18-25 years age group, no religious involvement, high school completion, and higher stress. Hazardous alcohol use was associated with male gender, younger men, no religious involvement, employment, some high school education, and higher stress. Hazardous use of other drugs was associated with Colored (mixed) race (particularly among men), no religious involvement, employment, and stress. For all substances, women, particularly Black women, had the lowest rates of hazardous use. Although the study is cross-sectional, it does identify groups that may be at high risk of substance misuse and for whom intervention is urgent. Because prevalence of substance use is high in this population, routine screening should be introduced in primary care clinics.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This article uses the Hapa movement as a case study in order to provide a framework for understanding identity as a goal of social movements and to expand on a theoretical understanding of multiracial social movements. In contrast to current understandings of identity-based movements, this article argues that the Hapa movement seeks simultaneously to deconstruct traditional notions of (mono)racial identities and to secure recognition for a multiracial ""Hapa"" identity. Movements that have identity as a goal are motivated by activists' understandings of how categories are constituted and how those categories, codes, and ways of thinking serve as axes of regulation and domination. The Hapa movement simultaneously challenges (mono)racial categories at both the institutional level through targeting the state and at the micro level through challenging the quotidian enactment of race and promulgating a Hapa identity. Activism by mixed-race individuals and organizations constitutes an important challenge to power that has significant implications for racial categorization and classification in contemporary American society.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This study describes past-year prevalence and effects on mental health and drinking outcomes for harassment and discrimination in the workplace (HDW) in a nationally representative random digit dial phone survey conducted in 2003-2004 (n = 2,151). HDW measures included experiences and perceptions of sexual harassment (SH) and generalized workplace harassment (GWH), and perceived harassment or discrimination because of race or ethnicity. Prevalence was examined by sex, race, age, occupation, marital status, and education. Effects of HDW were assessed controlling for demographics and job and life stressors. Experiencing multiple types of HDW was common. SH was more prevalent among women, and Blacks and those of other or mixed race or ethnicity experienced the highest levels of HDW overall. HDW variables explained additional variance in problem drinking and mental health beyond life and job stressors, particularly for women. This study demonstrates that HDW is a prevalent problem associated with poor mental health and problem drinking in the U.S. workforce.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Introduction: There is increasing awareness of the contribution of perceived social support (PSS) to emotional and physical well-being. Numerous scales measuring PSS have been developed, including the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The psychometric properties of the MSPSS have been demonstrated in diverse samples, although its reproducibility in the South African youth has not yet been investigated. Methods: This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the MSPSS in the South African youth using confirmatory factor analysis. The relationship of PSS to depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as the effects of sex and ethnicity, was investigated. Participants completed a battery of self-report measures, including the MSPSS, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist on a single occasion. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to validate the a priori factor structure of the MSPSS. In addition, Cronbach alpha coefficients and intercorrelations (for clinical variables) were calculated. A missing value analysis was performed to assess the influence of missing data on our findings. Results: Data are reported for 502 youth (11.3-23.5 years). The 3-factor structure of the MSPSS (significant other, family, and friends) fitted the data well. The MSPSS showed good internal consistency. Perceived social support was also positively correlated with resilience and negatively correlated with depression, exposure to community violence, and other potentially life-threatening traumas. Females and youth of white or mixed race reported significantly higher levels of PSS than males and black youth, respectively. Conclusions: The MSPSS is a psychometrically sound instrument that can be applied to South African youth.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Objective: We do not know how racial composition of a group influences behavior change for African Americans (AAs) in group-based weight loss programs. We tested the hypothesis that AA who participate in all AA weight loss intervention groups will lose more weight than AA who participate in mixed race groups. Methods and Procedures: This observational study was ancillary to Phase 1 of the Weight Loss Maintenance Study, a multi-center trial of strategies to maintain weight loss after a 20-week behavior modification program. Three of four centers recruited several all-AA intervention groups. Remaining groups were combinations of AA and non-AA participants. All participants received the same weight loss intervention. Change in weight was the primary outcome, comparing participants of all-AA groups with AA participants of mixed race groups conducted by the same AA interventionists. Secondary outcomes included measures of intervention adherence and behavior change. Results: Participants of all-AA groups (n = 271) were comparable to other AA participants (n = 106). The mean proportion of AA in mixed race groups was 56%. All-AA group participants had similar weight loss as those in mixed groups (-4.2 vs. -4.2 kg, P = 0.97). There were no differences between the groups in mean number of sessions attended or changes in dietary intake. Discussion: Significant weight loss was observed in both groups, with no effect of group composition on adherence or weight loss outcomes. Special logistics to accommodate all-AA groups may not be necessary. Despite varying instructional environments, AA appeared to respond positively to intervention messages with significant changes in dietary intake, physical activity (PA), and weight.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This study was conducted to assess the food and macronutrient consumption patterns of Head Start preschool children and their body weight status. Three data collections were conducted over 15 months with 125 children attending either morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) sessions. Sample portions from Breakfast (B), Lunch (L), and Snack (S) were photographed and weighed; individual student's plates were photographed and plate waste was both photographed and weighed; consumption and nutrient content for each meal /child /day was calculated using Nutritionist Pro v. 14.0. Over half of the subjects (52%) were female; 50% were Caucasian, 22% were African American, 10% were Hispanic, and 18% were Other, primarily of mixed race. The mean age was 5 months, average height and weight were 107.9 cm and 19.3 kg, respectively; the mean BMI was 16.5 kg /m2. Most (58%) of the children were Normal weight status, 19% were Overweight, and 18% were Obese; 20% of the males were Obese compared to 16% of females. Energy (kcal) and protein (g) offered was: B = 219 and 9; L = 353 and 17; S = 126 and 3; amounts consumed were B = 136 and 5; AM-L = 239 and 12; PM-L = 192 and 9; and S = 110 and 3. AM and PM children obtained only 22% and 18% of their daily energy requirement, respectively, while protein intakes were 2-3 times higher than the recommended one-third RDA. Children in the AM session had significantly higher nutrient intakes than those in the PM session. Children preferred energy-dense and familiar foods; acceptance rates for fresh fruit (33%-42%), raw vegetables (22%-29%), and cooked vegetables (15%-34%) were low. Food consumption patterns may be regulated by familiar foods and home food preferences. Preschool programs need to offer nutritionally balanced, palatable, and attractive meals and learning activities focused on increasing students' acceptance of unfamiliar foods, especially fruits and vegetables.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background: Injection drug users (IDUs) are at risk of acquiring HIV through injection and sexual practices. Methods: We analyzed data collected in five U.S. cities between 2002 and 2004 to identify correlates of HIV infection among 3285 IDUs ages 15-30 years. Results: Overall, HIV prevalence was 2.8% (95% CI 2.3-3.4), ranging from 0.8% in Chicago to 6.3% in Los Angeles. Mean age was 24 years, 70% were male, 64% non-Hispanic (NH) white, 7% NH black, 17% Hispanic, and 12% were other/mixed race. HIV infection was independently associated with: race/ethnicity (NH black [AOR 4.1, 95% CI 1.9-9.1], Hispanic [AOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5-8.4], or other/mixed [AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-5.2] vs. NH white); males who only had sex with males compared to males who only had sex with females (AOR 15.3, 95% CI 6.8-34.5); injecting methamphetamine alone or with heroin compared to heroin only (AOR 4.0, 95% CI 1.7-9.7); reporting inconsistent means of obtaining income compared to regular jobs (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.8); and having a history of exchanging sex for money/drugs (AOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.2). Conclusions: More than two decades after injection and sexual practices were identified as risk factors for HIV infection, these behaviors remain common among young IDUs. While racial/ethnic disparities persist, methamphetamine may be replacing cocaine as the drug most associated with HIV seropositivity. HIV prevention interventions targeting young IDUs and address both sexual and injection practices are needed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background: The epidemiology of DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is not well characterized in developing country settings. In South Africa, given the high rates of violence and trauma, there is particular interest in traumatic exposures as potential risk factors for IED. Methods: We examined the prevalence and predictors of IED in a nationally representative sample of 4,351 South African adults. IED and other diagnoses based on DSM-IV criteria were assessed using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). A 28-item scale was constructed to measure exposure to traumatic events. Results: Overall, 2.0% of participants (95% CI: 0-4.9%) fulfilled criteria for the narrow definition of IED, and 9.5% (95% CI: 6.6-12.3%) fulfilled criteria for the broad definition of IED. Individuals with IED experienced high rates of comorbid anxiety, mood and substance use disorders compared to non-IED participants. In multivariate analysis, a diagnosis of IED was associated with Caucasian and mixed-race ethnicity, psychiatric comorbidity and exposure to multiple traumatic events. Conclusion: These data suggest a relatively high prevalence of IED in South Africa. By reducing violence and trauma, and by providing appropriate psychological support to trauma survivors, we may be able to reduce rates of IED.

This study examines individual, maltreatment, and service-related factors associated with maltreatment rereporting and substantiated rereporting in a multistate context. Case-level National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System data (505,621 children) were analyzed. Within 24 months, 22% of children were rereported, and 7% were rereported with substantiation. Younger and White and mixed race children, those with disabilities, and those whose caregivers abused alcohol were more likely to be rereported and rereported and substantiated. Service provision, including foster care placement, was associated with increased likelihood of subsequent events. When CPS agency performance is assessed using measures of reentry, separate measures may be necessary for children who receive services, so that improvements in safety can be appropriately recognized. Rentry into CPS is a complex interaction of risks to children and systemic factors tied to the intervention they receive.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The aim of this investigation was to examine the factor structure of The Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC), an instrument designed to measure stress coping ability, in a sample of 701 South African adolescents. Confirmatory factor analysis failed to verify the original five-factor structure reported by Connor & Davidson, and an exploratory factor analysis suggested either a possible three-factor or two-factor structure in the current sample. Individual factor analyses by ethnicity suggested that the factor structure may differ among the different ethnic sub-groups. The reliability coefficient for the CD-RISC was 0.93. Age and ethnicity were the only demographic factors significantly correlated with CD-RISC scores. Age showed a negative relation to CD-RISC scores, and adolescents of black ethnicity had significant lower scores than their white and mixed race (coloured) counterparts. The CD-RISC scale could be a useful measure of resilience among South Africans, but future validation in South African populations is still needed.

Two studies examined the consequences of this identity denial. In Study 1, mixed-race participants reported that their biracial or multiracial identity caused tension in a variety of contexts. Study 2 focused on one often-mentioned situation: completing a demographic questionnaire in which only one racial background can be specified. Relative to mixed-race participants who were permitted to choose multiple races, those compelled to choose only one showed lower subsequent motivation and self-esteem. These studies demonstrate the negative consequences of constraining mixed-race individuals' expression of their chosen racial identity.

The men participated in an 8-week on-campus experience that included same and mixed race resource groups focusing on manhood. Group experiences were examined using the following eight themes: (1) Learning about differences, (2) Exploring the influences of masculinity and manhood, (3) Understanding relationships with men, (4) Understanding relationships with women, (5) Learning about manhood, (6) Forming lessons on manhood, (7) Experiencing Black Male Group (BMG) and Latino Male Group (LMG) intergroup interaction, and (8) Studying BMG and LMG optimization of intergroup boundaries. This study described a unique Group Guided Experiential Approach designed to support men in exploring manhood. Results indicated that there were both similarities and differences in how Black and Latino men come to understand, to develop, and define manhood overtime. Furthermore, the study emphasized how the examination of group memberships and relationships aid college men in exploring maleness. Implications for research and practice-especially the working relationship between researchers and practitioners were discussed.

Each prototypical face was generated from 64 face images of volunteers. Another sample of volunteers judged the typicality of color/race of the prototypical faces and the faces that composed them. The results suggested a concordance between the self-declared color/race and the judgments, indicating that the prototypical faces are representative of their respective categories of color/race.

In response to Annabella Bushra's discussion and her focus on what is missing in the clinical material, the author speculates about the repetition of the historical trauma of purifying mixed race in the face of its complexity-trying to neatly package race despite it not so neatly fitting into any one category-and losing the individual by overly focusing on skin color. The author considers the silence, secrecy, and transgression in the treatment and, in this context, a few of Bushra's key points are addressed-sorting out the nature of hate in relation to Susan, passing as transgression, and White guilt. A distinction is made between a malevolent, destructive hate and a loving hate, and White guilt is considered as a defense against recognition of the other.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Comment/Reply,,"Comments on an article by Christopher Bonovitz (see record 2010-11288-008). Christopher Bonovitz gives us a rich landscape of the theoretical, historical, and relational aspects of his work with his mixed-race patient. In my response I explore what seems missing: a stronger sense of the patient as a person, more of her own history in her family, more of the clinical back and forth with her therapist, a sense of what is being played out in the transference, and particularly what ""passing"" is for her. I show how his choices about how to think about her story and how to tell it are oversaturated with awareness of identity and race at the expense of the basic human relationship. In the face of such racial anxiety, there is a pull to rely too strongly on countertransference as a way to gain privileged access to knowledge about the other. I attribute many of these problems to the inescapable power of race in our culture. Furthermore, I address the themes of hatred, silence, secrecy and transgression as they relate to the history of transgenerational trauma for this patient and invite our broadening our awareness about how they play out in the therapeutic process. We are faced with the difficult, yet the essential task of holding and living out the patient's anger and outrage at the racial hatred that has been endured.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The author uses contemporary psychoanalytic theory in further understanding the negotiation of conflict and dissociation in biracial patients who are both African-American and White. Drawing on the work of contemporary theorists who have made efforts to navigate the relationship between inner and outer worlds in our understanding of race from a psychoanalytic perspective, the author examines the relationship between race, culture, and internalized self-other relations-how they interact with each other and impact splitting and dissociative processes among self-states. The author argues for a notion of the unconscious as one that contains historical trauma related to race relations that influences the developing capacity to sustain internal conflict between opposing self-states borne out of this trauma. The author shows how society works against the integration of racialized self-states and interferes with the capacity to contain conflict. Through an extended clinical vignette from an analysis of a mixed-race patient, the author looks at the interplay of self-states between a White analyst (author) and a mixed-race patient (African-American and White) as manifested through a series of enactments and the unconscious ""mating"" between dissociated self-states in both patient and analyst. The author argues that the analyst's engagement of his or her own dissociated self-states and containment of internal conflict is critical to aiding the patient in moving toward greater integration.

Scholars in this field claim that American discourse has falsely labeled multiracials as monoracial minorities through the unethical use of ambiguity, lying, ignorance, illogic, and stereotype. To challenge this discourse, they encourage multiracials to assert racially mixed identities through the ethics of definition, truth, knowledge, logic, and self-representation. Advocating these virtues, however, scholars imply that the multiracial subject can define, truthfully reveal, know, logically cohere, and represent herself in the first place. This ignores the extent to which all subjects remain opaque to themselves in ways that undermine the ethics of Mixed Race Studies. Considering the complications of definition, truth, knowledge, logic, and self-representation, scholars in this field must also consider the ethics of ambiguity, lying, ignorance, illogic, and stereotype. Rather than advocating definitions that divide multiracials from monoracials, scholars should use ambiguity to blur the lines between them. Instead of claiming that racially mixed people should self-identify truthfully, scholars should explore how self-identifying deceptively can challenge racial thinking. Scholars encourage the multiracial to know herself, but remaining ignorant of oneself in order to know the racial assumptions of another is a better way to undermine those assumptions. Mixed Race Studies advocates logical discourse, but illogical discourses contain the contradictions necessary to challenge racism. Multiracial autobiographers try to challenge racial assumptions with self-representation, but one might better undermine those assumptions by evoking, repeating, and subverting stereotypes. These ethics of ambiguity, lying, ignorance, illogic, and stereotype fall under what I call ""metissage ."" Metis is a French word for racially mixed people. Metissage refers to sexual, social, and conceptual hybridity that challenges racism. Metis is an ancient Greek term for cunning intelligence by which competitors defeat more powerful opponents. Metissage combines these three concepts, challenging metis to subversive forms of metissage that employ metis. I conclude that the ethics of Mixed Race Studies can and have challenged racial assumptions in American discourse, but scholars must go further and consider the ethics of metissage.

To acknowledge a person as multiracial, or a blending of more than one race, defies the conventional social construct that delineates clear, discernible, and discrete races. Even as multiracial students become increasingly visible in our nation's schools, multiracial identity is seldom recognized as a critical topic of diversity within the educational arena. By 2050, the multiracial population will surface as a majority group of people whose presence will require our nation to redefine our current constructs of race, racial identification, and racial classification (Anderson, 2002; Winters & DeBose, 2003). This qualitative research study seeks to address the primary research question: How and to what extent do public policy decisions regarding academic accountability affect educational outcomes for multiracial students in two states that differ in their multiracial categorization policies? The purpose of this study is to illuminate racial subgroups identified within accountability systems, determine the degree to which multiracial students are rendered visible in the academic accountability movement, and examine the needs of multiracial students. The research design is a comparative case study of two state education agencies and the public policies they employ when monitoring the academic achievement of multiracial students. The major findings of this study reveal: (1) a misalignment between federal and state accountability systems for racial classification; (2) a variance in how two state education agencies racially classify mixed race students; (3) a non-standardized approach to school enrollment categorization of multiracial students; (4) controversy regarding the meaning of race and ethnicity; (5) various approaches taken by multiracial students when self-identifying (6) data methodology challenges; and (7) a more than ten year lapse in time before the federal Department of Education moved towards complying with the White House Office of Management and Budget regulations allowing multiracial individuals to identify as more than one race. The implications of this research indicate a significant need for the United States' educational system to face the challenge of recognizing and responding to the histories, experiences, and identities of multiracial students within our schools.

Fertile women in low quality relationships (e.g., less committed, more abusive) showed more negative, conflicted, and ambivalent as well as less positive relationship feelings relative to both fertile women in high quality relationships and to non-fertile women. Supplementary analysis showed partner attractiveness (PA) was uncorrelated with relationship quality (RQ), and PA also moderated the ovulatory shift such that fertile women paired with attractive men felt better about their relationships than did all other women. Three way interactions (Fertility X RQ X PA) confirmed that RQ and PA are not only distinct components of mate quality but that they also moderate the influence of ovulatory shifts on relationship feelings.

Over the centuries, the Hmong are among those ancient people who have migrated from one location to another in search of the peace and freedom to live and practice their traditional way of life in solidarity. As they migrated into the various regions, they often had to live within the cultures of those new environments while striving to maintain their traditional rituals and practices. As one of many refugee groups migrating to the United States, the Hmong have made radical changes to their traditional practices, particularly traditional Hmong marriage ceremony rituals. A qualitative study using semistructured, face-to-face and telephone interviews was conducted to discover factors that have affected change to the traditional Hmong marriage ceremony among the 0.5-generation Hmong participants. The 0.5-generation Hmong are individuals who were born in Laos and raised and educated in the United States with a common knowledge of both Hmong and American cultures. All of the participants in this study resided in the states of California and Utah in the United States. Thematic analysis was the methodology approach used for analyzing the qualitative data in this study. The data were themed and conclusions were drawn based on the participants' interview responses. Some of the themes identified by the participants regarding the factors that have resulted in changes to the traditional Hmong marriage ceremony rituals were (a) time required for marriage rituals, (b) lack of knowledge of the rituals, (c) religion, (d) significance of Hmong rituals, (e) assimilation and acculturation to the American culture, (f) education, (g) mixed race marriages, (h) money required for rituals, (i) language, and (j) the shift in thinking from collectivism to individualism. These factors have influenced some of the Hmong to consider different and varied marriage ceremony approaches upon marrying in the United States. Although these participants have married within the traditional Hmong marriage arrangement ceremonies, they were open to their children's preferences and choice of marriage arrangement options. The essential marriage elements were continued to be practiced by the 0.5-generation Hmong even though modifications have been made to some of the traditional Hmong marriage ceremony rituals. With the Hmong quickly adapting to and adopting the American culture, there were high expectations that the Hmong will continue to preserve and practice their traditional marriage practices and rituals with their marriage ceremony preferences.

The researcher had unprecedented access to Curry's professional life during eight weeks between October 2005 and February 2008 at NBC News World Headquarters in New York City. She observed Curry's daily work experiences, including those for the Today show, Dateline, and NBC Nightly News. The researcher also interviewed Curry about covering current event issues that occurred during the research period. Events included the crisis in Darfur, the Israeli/Hezbollah conflict, and Benazir Bhutto's return to Pakistan. Other methods included: (1) analysis of documents pertaining to the General Electric Company, parent of NBC Universal and NBC News; (2) analysis of media representations of Curry to determine her public image; and (3) biographical research about Curry obtained from published materials and interviews with Curry and her father. Analysis of the data revealed three themes that shape Curry's role as a network newswoman. These themes were assessed through a multi-perspective theoretical framework blending feminist media theories, the political economy of communication, and ways of classifying news. Behind the scenes at NBC News, Curry is a leader who is widely counted on and is committed to working as part of a team. Curry is an idealist who believes that journalism is still a public service; in this regard, she is a humanitarian reporter in the sense that she treats her sources as human beings and not as sound bites and privileges humanity by what she deems newsworthy. Celebrity is also central to Curry's role as a network newswoman. She understands the degree of fame involved with her position, but considers herself, first and foremost, a news professional. This research contributes to scholarship about the interplay of gender, race, celebrity, and news values as exemplified in the work of one mixed-race woman who has achieved success in network news. The project contributes to communication scholarship by addressing the theoretical relationship of ethnography and journalism.

Through five moments in United States history, this project asks what the idea of racially mixed people does for America, uncovering a set of vanguards who suggested that, rather than fear racial mixing, we should embrace it as a means to live up to ideals of equality and inclusion, thus benefiting the nation as a whole. Whether the subject is abolitionist Wendell Phillips's defense of racial amalgamation, the popularity of the Melting Pot trope, Time Magazine's 1993 New Face of America issue, or the promises of a ""Multiracial"" category on the 2000 census, similar notions regarding novelty, progress, and utopia repeat themselves. Rounding out ""America's New Racial Heroes"" is an examination of contemporary praise of ambiguity at the same time Americans wish for quantifiable racial makeup. Overall, this project warns against the giddy hope that racially mixed people alone can solve America's racial problems. I have several models in bringing together these five cases, including George M. Fredrickson's The Black Image in the White Mind, Philip J. Deloria's Playing Indian, and Robert Lee's Orientals. Each of these shows how discourses of science, nationality, and popular culture shape the identities of dominant and minority groups concurrently. Like these works, my project brings together archival research, cultural studies readings, and theories of racial formation to examine how pro-mixing advocates situate themselves within their own contexts and resonate through time. This work on mixed race identity has many intersections with both fields, accentuating the richness that can result from comparative, ethnic studies work across disciplinary boundaries.

Vol.69(11-B),2009, pp. 7187.",,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,,"In recent times, there has been an increase in studies that pay particular attention to traditional or 'hegemonic' forms of masculinity that are characterized by an unbridled and coercive male sexuality. However, in some of these studies, when young people were addressed, they were often represented as powerless beings at the mercy of macro processes of socialization. This study addresses negotiation and construction of young masculine identities (masculinities) by focusing on the experiences of a sample of 78 Grade 10 and 11 boys (aged between 14 and 19 years). The present research is informed by a feminist poststructuralist approach and a discourse analytical method which assumes that language is constitutive in identity formation processes. The data for the study was gathered through conversations with boys in the following interview formats: (1) an all-male focus group, (2) a single-'race' focus group, (3) a mixed-'race' focus group, and (4) a 'private' one-to-one interview. While identity talk was orientated towards the production of traditional male heterosexual subject positions in the all-male focus groups, in the one-to-one interviews, boys in this study frequently resorted to 'softer' or 'reflexive' subject positions that acted as fissures of resistance against the predominantly ritualized group talk of boys. In the latter context, a common strategy used by boys also involved the calculated attempt to 'buy back' into values embodied within more traditional definitions of masculinity. This study has produced some insightful understandings of male-bonding talk, particularly the demonstration of the dependence of 'hegemonic' masculinities on the discursive subordination of 'the other', most notably women, gay men and boys perceived as belonging to other 'race' categories. This thesis suggests, on the basis of poststructuralist theories of identity, and given the presence of contradictory discourses, that there is potential for the cultivation of more progressive (pro-feminist) masculinities. It is argued that interventions with boys need to acknowledge and encourage work that emphasizes the multiplicity and contradictory nature of sexual identities in boys so that boys become less invested in constructing themselves as being intrinsically different from girls and versions of femininity.

The study was located within a conceptual framework predominantly informed by a constructivist approach, as well as some tenets from the social constructionist approach. This study focused only on M-R relationships consisting of black and white partners. The couples were recruited through the use of a snowball sampling method. In-depth interviews were used as the primary tool for collecting data. All participants were interviewed by the researcher either at their own homes or in the researcher's office. The collected information was later transcribed and qualitatively analysed. The results of the study indicate that individuals found their involvement in M-R relationships to be a positive experience, and thus resulting in a positive attitude change and a sense of personal growth. M-R couples and their extended families experienced cognitive dissonance which required them to discard their previously internalised racial stereotypes, using strategies such as cognitive differentiation, re-categorization and de-categorization, allowing shifts toward non-racial socially constructed categories. Most of the challenges of being in M-R relationships were experienced on interpersonal and inter-group levels. The losses, disadvantages, challenges, concerns and pains experienced by M-R couples were mainly related to family and social disapproval of the relationship as well as efforts to discourage race mixing. The study concludes that the non-conformist nature of M-R relationships requires from the participants a high level of self-differentiation and individuation that challenges racial norms and cultural collectivism. Albeit being a personal or private matter, a M-R relationship carries the burden of easily being the subject of public discourse. It is in this sense that M-R relationships cannot be understood without taking the socio-political context within which they occur into consideration.

There were a total of 30 participants in this study: 13 male and 17 female, ages 22-26, living in various regions of the United States, who had one parent who identified as White/Caucasian and one who identified as Asian/Asian American, Black/African American, or Hispanic/Latino/a. The participants were free of a history of felony convictions, substance abuse and suicide attempts. They completed both an informational questionnaire and a 90-minute telephone interview. Results of the study highlighted that biracial individuals are not doomed because of their dual heritage, despite this emphasis in earlier research. It is entirely possible to be well adjusted in a number of respects: meeting personal expectations; attainment of close family and other social relationships; comfortable with ethnic/racial identity; bicultural competence and sense of inclusion in desired community(ies); social justice; and sense of self-efficacy in raising own multiracial child(ren). There is not agreement from the participants on a set formula for success, but overriding themes include having a loving and supportive family that preferably stays intact; connections with all of one's cultural heritage, but not necessarily with family or community members who are belittling or disrespectful; egalitarian messages that neither promote self-oppression nor self-superiority; opportunities to explore, normalize and celebrate the mixed race experience; and the freedom to self-define over time and context, even when these choices are not congruent with family or community expectations. All individuals, families and communities in this study demonstrated the ability to both support and hinder healthy biracial development. Results did not differ with regard to demographic nuances of gender, racial composition, socio-economic status (SES), or geographic location.

Using a transnational framework, I show how identity constructions in Japan emerge from a combination of new experiences interacting with people in Japan, and past experiences in the United States that continue to shape self-perceptions. I use the case of Japanese Americans in Japan to reconsider how the concepts of race and ethnicity can be used to develop a comparative framework for discussing global constructions of race and ethnicity. My findings are based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork in Japan, including 50 qualitative interviews with Japanese Americans living in the Tokyo area. Japanese American migration to Japan is a specific type of transnational movement: that of an ethnic group to its ancestral homeland. As a framework for comparatively discussing multiple constructions of Japaneseness in the United States and Japan, to flesh out the complexities of Japanese American ""ethnic return"" experiences in Japan, I theorize ""Japanese"" as what I call a heterogeneous global ethnic group-an ethnic group that spans national borders and is internally diverse. This concept is similar to the notion of diaspora in some ways but can enable a discussion of Japanese American migration to Japan that diaspora cannot. Three types of identity formations among Americans of Japanese ancestry in Japan can be discerned. First, Japanese Americans from the U.S. continent who can phenotypically blend into Japanese society tend to reconstruct what I term ""racialized national identities"" as ""Japanese Americans"" in Japan. Second, ethnic Japanese from Hawai'i reconstruct ""Hawai'i"" identities while in Japan. Finally, mixed race Japanese Americans must grapple with the category of ""hafu,"" which is gaining increasing social recognition in Japan.

I explain how this theory is a theoretical approach to literature, as well as a living theory that creates political activism for social change. This project allows for an expansion of Mestizaje theory by defining and positioning new subjects within the Mestizaje paradigm. Therefore, I take contemporary Mestizaje out of the ""solely"" Mexican American/Chicano/a contexts, as well as out of the bi-cultural context, making it a theory for/of the multiracial and multiethnic U.S. American. Thus, this expansion of Mestizaje, or Third Space Mestizaje, is a synthesis of theoretical approaches to literature that stem from the works of Chela Sandoval, Gloria Anzaldua, Emma Perez, Eden Torres, Jaques Audinet, Juan De Castro and Rafael Perez-Torres. This synthesis allows me to create a lens that can be used to analyze literature; it is a lens that is comprised of third space mestizo/a characteristics. Furthermore, I implement Third Space Mestizaje as a Critical Approach to Literature. Ultimately, this dissertation explores and explains Third Space Mestizaje as a critical mixed-race theory that explores individual identity in relation to collective identities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Psychological research in the USA and elsewhere suggests that race is regarded as an underlying, inherited ""essential"" trait, like membership in a biological species. Yet Brazil has often been regarded as very different from the USA: as a country in which racial variation is seen as more continuous than categorical, more a matter of appearance than descent. This study tests alternative theories of racial cognition in Bahia, Brazil. Data include racial classification of drawings and photographs, judgments of similarity-dissimilarity between racial categories, ideas about expected and possible race of offspring from inter-racial unions, heritability of racial and non-racial traits, and conservation of race through changes in appearance. The research demonstrates consensus over time in appearance-based classification, yet race is also thought of as an ""essential"" trait. However, racial essences can be mixed, with a person containing the hereditary potential of multiple races, so that race in Bahia does not define clear-cut groups or discrete ""living kinds."" If essentialism is the shared core of folk theories of race, there may be more variability and room for social construction in the categorization of mixed-race individuals.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book Making multiracials: State, family, and market in the redrawing of the color line by Kimberly McClain DaCosta (2007). Based on multiple methods, the book paints a multiracial mosaic from in-depth interviews with 62 participants in groups formed for intermarried couples, their families, and multiracial adults, in addition to fieldwork conducted at related events such as mixed-race conferences, college campuses, and public hearings on census classification. The book is divided into seven chapters on various realms including families, communities, and the market, woven together by connected threads on how multiracials have been constructed-socially, culturally, and politically. In the end, Making Multiracials provides a compelling and convincing analysis of not only multiracialism, but the larger racial politics. The strength of the work lies in DaCosta's multilayered critique of the ways in which multiracialism is constructed. By blending theory, empirical examination, and strong analysis, Making Multiracials offers a nuanced context for understanding the roles that individuals, communities, and policies play in perpetuating and potentially combating racial inequality.

We examined whether Whites and African Americans adopt 'teacher' versus 'learner' roles when discussing race-relevant versus race-irrelevant topics in mixed-race versus same-race groups. Furthermore, we tested whether concern about appearing prejudiced and prior knowledge of the topic predicted role adopted. Results confirmed that African Americans adopted a 'teacher' role whereas Whites adopted a 'learner' role during interracial discussions about race. Assuming a teacher role predicted greater willingness to engage in future interracial discussions about race; but Whites, who were concerned about appearing prejudiced when talking about race, were less likely to adopt a teacher role than African Americans.

Although the PHW contributed greatly toward improving public health conditions, not all of its activities were models of cooperative success. Many Japanese perceived some measures-terminated pensions for wounded Japanese veterans, lack of support for segregated orphanages for mixed-race children, and suppression of Japanese atomic bomb medical reports-as promoting US national interest at the expense of Japanese public health needs. Similarly, the PHW's upgrade of nursing education and separation of the professions of medicine and pharmacy were reversed because neither professionals nor the public saw these measures as urgent. Their reinstitution toward the end of the twentieth century suggests that the progressive measures were sound, but broke too sharply with Japanese tradition and were enforced prematurely.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This study examines disparities in co-occurring mental health and substance use problems by race/ethnicity to inform the development of culturally appropriate treatment approaches. Using pooled clinical data collected with the Global Assessment of Individual Needs, we identified racial/ethnic and other factors associated with co-occurring internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and the combination thereof in adolescents in federally funded treatment facilities. Results show that after controlling for demographic and socio environmental factors, African Americans, Hispanics, and mixed-race adolescents were more likely than Whites to have co-occurring internalizing problems. African Americans and Native Americans were less likely than Whites to have externalizing problems and to have combined internalizing and externalizing problems. Presence of co-occurring problems was also associated with victimization, homelessness, and family substance abuse. These results indicate that co-occurring mental health problems vary by race/ethnicity, and therefore, refined approaches are needed for culturally appropriate care of patients.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) Race is a socially constructed way of grouping people, which differs among societies and over time. It has no biological basis. In the United States, many individuals have experienced misrepresentation because of restrictive racial labels. Multiracial is an inclusive identification term that ""refers to people who are of two or more racial heritages"" and refers ""to people across all racial mixes"". The multiracial movement, which gained momentum in the late 1970's and early 1980's, has been proactively addressing the unique issues of the mixed race population in the United States. The multiracial movement is being pursued by people dedicated to the advancement of the rights and self-expression of multiracial individuals and families. Our chapter aims to advance the multiracial movement by bridging the language barrier that is present both within the mixed-race community and between multiracial and monoracial persons. We propose that this language barrier is the lack of a vernacular that is sufficiently reflective of the identities and existence of people of mixed heritage. The voice and authentic experiences of racially mixed people within the United States have been suppressed and silenced by a lack of inclusive terminology. Current racial conceptualizations emphasize an either/or approach that can unnecessarily dichotomize identity for people of racially mixed heritage. There is a need for people to openly consider the multiple possibilities of mixed race individuals' heritages. The language barrier in the United States can be overcome if society as a whole is willing to adopt a multiracial-affirmative language and mindset. In this chapter, we advocate suggestions for how all individuals-both multiracial and monoracial persons-can use various mixed race identity terminology, see the world through a multiracial-affirmative lens, and implement multiracial-affirmative actions.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Jobs, social group memberships, or living arrangements lead many people to interact every day with another person from a different racial background. Given that research has shown that interracial interactions are often stressful, it is important to know how these daily interactions unfold across time and what factors contribute to the success or failure of these interactions. Both members of same-race and mixed-race college roommate pairs completed daily questionnaires measuring their emotional experiences and their perceptions of their roommate. Results revealed that roommates in mixed-race dyads experienced less positive emotions and intimacy toward their roommates than did roommates in same-race dyads and that the experience of positive emotions declined over time for ethnic minority students with White roommates. Mediation analyses showed that the negative effects of roommate race were mediated by the level of intimacy-building behaviors performed by the roommate. Implications for future research and university policies are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, Racial union: Law, intimacy, and the white state in Alabama, 1865-1954 by Julie Novkov (2008). Novkov views bans on interracial intimacy not as a legacy of a bygone era but as a key resource in state-building. Limiting her scope to the development of a single state on a single issue provides a focused lens to track the life of the law and its use in constructing a regime of white supremacy. Novkov steps out of the periodization in one chapter to capture a pattern in white masculinity in the period 1914-1944. White men who bequeathed property to their children were faced with the consequences of anti-miscegenation laws when their bequests to their mixed-race children were called into question. By narrowing her scope to one state and one legal construct, Novkov produces a history of the opportunities and challenges involved in state-building.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, Race, ethnicity and nation: Perspectives from kinship and genetics by P. Wade (2007). Among the issues addressed in this volume are transnational adoption, ethnicity and assisted reproduction, mixed-race families, immigration, the transmission of ethnicity in post-Soviet Lithuania, and changing conceptions of Basque racial identity. This book is a useful and illuminating read for those with a particular interest in the ways in which new technologies and associated practices are changing ways of thinking about kinship in Europe. All the chapters in this volume ask questions about the supposedly 'given' nature of kinship. By interrogating the boundaries between nature and culture, the authors illustrate the varied ways in which the supposedly natural relations that are the basis of much racial and ethnic categorization are produced in local social, cultural, and historical worlds. However, despite its strengths, this volume has several weaknesses. A lack of explicitness in methodology may leave the reader wondering how some of the authors arrived at their conclusions. In addition, many of the studies rely heavily on media or print sources. The chapters that make use of both media sources and interviews or participant observation provide a stronger, more convincing and more varied body of evidence than those that rely more exclusively on media sources.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"People perceive and evaluate others according to social categories. Yet social perception is complicated by the fact that people have multiple social identities, and self-categorization with these identities shifts from one situation to another. Two experiments examined whether self-categorization with a novel mixed-race group would override automatic racial bias. Participants assigned to a mixed-race group had more positive automatic evaluations of Black ingroup than Black outgroup members. Comparing these evaluations to Black and White faces unaffiliated with either group indicated this preference was driven by ingroup bias rather than outgroup derogation. Moreover, both outgroup and unaffiliated faces elicited automatic racial bias (White > Black), suggesting that automatic evaluations are sensitive to both the current intergroup context (positive evaluations of novel ingroup members) and race (racial bias toward outgroup and unaffiliated faces). These experiments provide evidence that self-categorization can override automatic racial bias and that automatic evaluations shift between and within social contexts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The issue of race has long cast a shadow on the founding mythology of the United States, but today some scholars argue race is declining in significance, as evidenced by the rise of interracial unions and the fact that the offspring of such unions can now officially acknowledge their mixed-race backgrounds. However, the sizeable growth of the Asian and Latino populations in the United States through immigration complicates the issue. Seemingly neither black nor white, the new immigrants are generating increased diversity and raising questions about whether today's color line replicates the old Black-White demarcation. The research results introduced in this article suggest the contemporary color line in the United States more reflects a Black/non-Black division than a White/non-White one.

Efforts toward theory construction on multiracial identity development, however, have been largely disconnected from empirical data, mired in disciplinary debates, and bound by historically specific assumptions about race and racial group membership. This study provides a critical overview of multiracial identity development theories, examines the links between theory and research, explores the challenges to multiracial identity theory construction, and proposes considerations for future directions in theorizing racial identity development among the mixed-race population.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, Black Identity in the 20th Century: Expressions of the U.S. and U.K. African Diaspora by M. Christian (2002). This book is an outstanding collection of essays that brings together scholars from the United States and the United Kingdom to offer analysis on a wide range of topics from Pan-Africanism to mixed-race identity in the 20th century. The essays are linked through common themes of resistance and struggle against White racism, marginalization, and racial discrimination. The author defines Black as persons/groups who can claim African heritage throughout the world. Although he refuses to be labeled an essentialist, the author takes pains to argue that there is an ""essence"" to being of African descent in the 20th century. Therefore, the contributors openly discuss the commonality of experiences that Black people have had throughout the various social histories of the United States and the United Kingdom. This offering is a much-needed vehicle for African-centered voices to the discourse on Black identity in the 21st century.

These reactions have often been based on the oppressions of history, the injustices of the present, and the hopes for a radically different future. This article traces the common historical responses, both positive and negative, within Black communities to mixed race identities, thereby elucidating contemporary reactions to race mixture within Black communities. In so doing, it argues that an historical understanding of these reactions as well as a recognition of the positions mixed race individuals occupy can challenge assumptions about race, difference, identity, and community-fostering new ground on which individuals can stand for common causes within heterogeneous communities.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) After the completion of the first circumnavigation of the globe by Magellan in 1521, the cultural gaze of Europeans was widened through the notion of"" discoverie,"" and the interconnectedness of the new capitalist world-system saw the Portuguese become the first European presence in a global web linking Portugal with Africa, the Americas, and Asia. The largely male encounter with the ""other"" inevitably led to the proliferation of travel narratives that attempted to make sense of the place of interracial intimacy as part of the discourse of a new world system. The imperial canon in numerous global contexts provides us with ample evidence to suggest that the European male encounter with the sensual and exotic ""other"" was often translated as a sexual encounter with indigenous women in which the project of commercial conquest and the acquisition of female bodies were symbolically intertwined with each other. Ann Stoler has argued, the politics of mixed race and the social categorization of mixed-race children constituted a social and political space where the colonial state sought to enforce categories of rule. Ann Stoler points out, ""mixedness itself was a moving and strategic category,"" and different imperial projects produced a range of contested responses to mixedness across time, space, and location. This essay addresses this valuable point from two different angles in view of the fact that there has been surprisingly little attention to the moving category of whiteness in the context of early colonial India. In this essay, the author suggests that both gender and religion were important ""political rationalities"" that shaped the contours and meaning of whiteness in the discursive space of colonial India in different ways in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By focusing on the cultural dialogue between English and Portuguese colonialisms, the author charts how the role of Catholic Portuguese Eurasian women can illuminate these rationalities through the lens of intimate relationships that were deeply implicated in the politics of colonial knowledge.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This article analyzes race-targeted policy in Brazil as both a political stake and a powerful instrument in an unfolding classificatory struggle over the definition of racial boundaries. The Brazilian state traditionally embraced mixed-race classification, but is adopting racial quotas employing a black/white scheme. To explore potential consequences of that turn for beneficiary identification and boundary formation, the author analyzes attitudinal survey data on race-targeted policy and racial classification in multiple formats, including classification in comparison to photographs. The results show that almost half of the mixed-race sample, when constrained to dichotomous classification, opts for whiteness, a majority rejects mixed-race individuals for quotas, and the mention of quotas for blacks in a split-ballot experiment nearly doubles the percentage choosing that racial category. Theories of how states make race emphasize the use of official categories to legislate exclusion. In contrast, analysis of the Brazilian case illuminates how states may also make race through policies of official inclusion.

Although West Point has and continues to be a major development source of our nation's leaders, very little literature exists today that attempts to understand West Point's curriculum impact on the guiding leadership principles of its graduates. With its high entrance requirements, West Point's student body continues to be largely white male while moral and ethical leadership development has and continues to be its primary student development mission. In recognizing that today's volunteer Army is multiracial and that Army ""leadership must weld together soldiers of mixed race, ethnic background, and sex into effective collaborative units"" (Bass & Avolio, 2000, p. 2), the purpose of this study was to determine: What are the guiding leadership principles of West Point graduates? How has West Point's overall curriculum impacted the guiding leadership principles of its graduates? How do West Point graduates interpret and carry out the values instilled by West Point's curriculum? This study indicates that the three main guiding leadership principles of West Point graduates are: (1) leading by example, (2) leading from the front, and (3) respect and consideration of others. Participants of this study revealed that they continue to rely on and use these principles in their leadership positions ranging from leading soldiers in combat to leading Fortune 500 companies. They also shared that many of the values and guiding principles espoused by West Point were already in their possession when they entered the academy. These concepts were further brought into sharper focus at West Point by the ""hands-on"" leadership opportunities they were afforded as cadets. The most beneficial of these experiences were situations that occurred outside the formal academic curriculum. Successful leadership development situations placed them out of their comfort zone and included engaged mentoring. Participants of this study indicated that West Point's Drill Cadet Program should become a mainstream experience in lieu of Cadet Tactical Leadership Training (CTLT) because it enabled them to develop a deeper understanding and awareness of the real Army soldiers they would lead upon graduation. All participants also expressed that West Point's demanding formal academics centered on engineering taught and/or revealed the values of time management, self-discipline, resiliency, and the benefits associated in working with others.

Vol.69(6-A),2008, pp. 2324.",,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,,"At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the United States is experiencing the expansion of a self-identified biracial, multiracial, and mixed race citizenry. This work examines the dominant tropes operative in the study of mixed race narrative cultural production, specifically film, fiction, and life-writing, in order to historicize and contextualize contemporary cultural production. In particular, this dissertation examines contemporary narratives with regard to the ""tragic mulatto"" trope in US culture throughout the 19th and 20th century and articulates the ways in which the abundance of contemporary work on mixed race both sustains and resists old archetypes and narratives. To this end, a survey of life-writing, fiction, and speculative film and fiction of the past fifteen years is conducted to determine new narrative tropes governing mixed race identity, particularly those identities that deviate from the historical black/white binary of biracial identity. While some texts remain grounded in the idea of the mixed race person as deficient or problematic with regards to race and gender identity development, the dissertation identifies a general turn away from the ""tragic mulatto"" archetype, and a turn toward the mixed race identity as a holistic hybrid identity that is more than the sum of its parts. The study reveals that contemporary renderings of mixed race identity have become transnational, dynamic, unsettling, and synergistic. Further, the emergent tropes in mixed race narratives suggest hybridity as the inevitable future of humanity and some contemporary texts suggest that this hybridity is the mechanism through which humanity will progress toward racial equity and substantive democratic principles. These new narratives are explicated, analyzed, and critiqued with regard to their function in contemporary United States culture and politics.

The learning community model under investigation was based on theory and research highlighting the importance of academic and social integration for student retention and graduation. The study consisted of analyses at two levels. The first level used quantitative methods to examine the effect of learning communities by comparing academic outcomes between learning community and non-learning community African American male freshmen. To further examine the impact of learning communities, the second level of analyses examined the leaning community experiences of African American male freshmen, including the impact of learning community composition and focus (i.e., an all African American Male Learning Community-AAMI, and mixed race and sex learning communities-non-AAMI). Findings from the first part of the study show that African American male freshmen who participated in a learning community attempted and completed significantly more credits at the end of their second semester of college as compared to a matched sample of African American male freshmen who did not participate in a learning community. Return rates, second semester grade point averages, and first to second semester grade point average gains were similar among both groups. Qualitative data were gathered through entrance questionnaires, focus groups, journals, and semi-structured interviews. Findings from these data suggest that academic integration was achieved in both the AAMI learning community and the non-AAMI learning communities. However, student participants in the AAMI learning community identified recurring themes of positive social integration experiences; opportunities for self-expression and self-affirmation; positive faculty support; and positive friendship-bonds. Students in non-AAMI learning communities did not report these experiences. In addition, non-AAMI learning community participants expressed more racial incidents and racial microaggressions than the AAMI learning community group. Implications of the study's findings for research and practice to improve African American male college academic outcomes and retention are discussed.

At the California Institute of Integral Studies, this process was created to assist non-native people to reconnect with their own indigenous ancestral knowledge, rituals, and ways of being. The author was enrolled as a graduate student in the RIM Doctoral Program, which shook her to the core and initiated her journey towards wholeness. Through the uncovering of indigenous roots and ancestral histories, the process served as a healing mechanism to integrate all parts of the author's being, some of which had previously been blocked out and denied unconsciously. The question implicit in this work is: what makes mixed race women stumble and become immobilized in their quest to find their wholeness of being and solid identity? Written in the first person, this dissertation focuses on the author's journey by focusing on her identity as a female of mixed race ancestry. In relation to her ancestral heritage, it provides a map, a process of integration that may be followed by other women of mixed race ancestry. However, it may be of particular relevance and importance to those women of ancestral heritages similar to the author's, who are open to non-Western ways of connecting with, listening to, and learning from the guidance of their ancestors.

The purpose of this research was to discover whether and how students' racial designation preferences differed over time or across various written and verbal contexts in order to discover the personal and institutional characteristics and experiences associated with those differences. The results reveal the power behind taking a longitudinal approach to student characteristics that are typically treated as static, such as race. This research has implications for the ways in which race and ethnicity are conceptualized, quantified, and represented within the context of higher education. The results provide a detailed representation of multiracial college students, in terms of the specific racial composition of their backgrounds, other personal characteristics, college experiences, and an analysis of how their designation choices change over the span of college. Through logistic regression analyses, the college-level factors associated with changes in students' identification preferences centered around experiences and environments that exposed students to diverse racial and ethnic individuals and viewpoints. The qualitative data revealed the aspects of college that participants identified as being salient to identity or personal conceptualizations of race; these ranged from academic to extracurricular, included exposure to racially diverse peers and ideas, and highlighted the unique opportunity for self-reflection that college provides. The study provides empirical support for students' micro-level awareness of the macro-level identity politics described in Omi and Winant's (1994) Racial Formation Theory, which served as the theoretical framework for the study. The results also lend support for a more multidimensional, dynamic approach to racial identity that considers the factors that are most salient to this identification process. Overall, the research supports a disaggregated approach to counting multiracial students rather than relegating them to a single category, particularly for the purposes of institutional policies and practices because such aggregation over-generalizes and undercounts students of color.

The assessment of ADHD is best accomplished through a comprehensive assessment process that includes direct observation, behavioral rating scales, structured interviews involving the child, parents/home, and school, as well as, cognitive and intellectual assessment instruments. Cognitive and intellectual tests can measure working memory, inattention, and sequential reasoning which have been shown to be negatively impacted by ADHD (Barkley, 1997, Reddy & DeThomas, 2006). The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition (SB5;Roid, 2003a) is a popular and widely used cognitive assessment tool. To date, no studies have assessed the use of the SB5 with a school aged ADHD population. This study examined the usefulness of the SB5 in discriminating between school-aged children with ADHD and those in a matched control sample. The sample included a total of 188 children matched on age, gender, race and socioeconomic status (measured by parent's educational level). The children's mean age was 10.2 (SD=3.1) and ranged from 5 to 18 years. The racial breakdown of the sample was 70% Caucasian, 17% Black/African-American, 10% Latino, 2% mixed race and 1% other. The parents were primarily college educated (56%). The FSIQ, VIQ, NVIQ, ABIQ, four of the five factors, and seven of the ten subtests of the SB5 were significantly lower for the children with ADHD than for the controls. The discriminant function analyses revealed that the most effective model for the SB5 was using the 5 Factors or ten Subtests in a discriminant model, resulting in overall correct classification (OCC) of 71%. ROC curves were calculated from the discriminant functions and indicated area under the curve (AUC) values for the five Factor and ten Subtest discriminant models of .76 and .78 respectively. The results of this study were consistent with existing literature on ADHD and cognitive testing for children with ADHD.

The project compares English-language novels, short fiction, and essays authored by Filipina/os who wrote and published in the Philippines and the United States. I argue that the texts' transpacific femininities-complex productions of Filipinas-counter representations of women as idealized embodiments of the nation (or other reified models) that recur in Philippine cultural discourse from the 1890s to the 1950s. The Filipinas in these works travel, attend universities, speak multiple languages, and wear Western fashions; become politically involved through independence campaigns or guerrilla wars; and criticize the repressive influences of Catholicism, have unsanctioned relationships with white American men, or question their roles as wives and mothers. Through these varied configurations of Filipinas, I pinpoint transpacific femininities as posing an essential challenge to the future viability of the Philippines and Filipina/o identity. For authors such as Maximo Kalaw, Felicidad Ocampo, Juan Laya, Bienvenido N. Santos, and Yay Panlilio (Marking), controlling or recognizing the potential of the transpacific Filipina crucially reconstructs the racial, classed, sexualized, and gendered terms of emergent national identities and communities. I contend that a period previously seen by scholars as the realm of the male Filipino exile or immigrant is one that is also dominated by transnational women. The works intimately cross explorations of transpacific identities and feminism with redefinitions of the Philippine nation, Filipina/o communities in the United States, and the identities of their members. By comparing texts published in the Philippines and the United States, my project decentralizes the site from which literary scholarship has traditionally viewed Asian/America-the U.S. mainland-and questions the geographical restrictions surrounding our objects of critical study. Ultimately, I merge arenas previously conceived by literary critics as mutually exclusive categories: literary cultural nationalism, transnational feminism, and Asian/American literature of the pre-1965 period.

This system of categorization, endorsed by most black movements, conflicts with popular belief in a mixed-race moreno (brown) identity based not only on ancestry, but also on observable physical features. Through a combination of ethnographic and experimental methods, I examine the apparent clash of ideologies in Belmonte and show striking similarities in the implicit thinking processes underlying people's espousals of these contrasting ideologies. Residents demonstrated high levels of agreement in sorting diverse pictures into groups; they reasoned in similar ways about how family ancestry would affect classification; and they considered physical features to be critical rather than superficial for classification in certain contexts. I also show that the way people think about race may be changing, that young people may be thinking about categories in novel ways even if they are not adopting new ideologies wholesale. High school children who are learning about new racial categories may implicitly be attributing stronger causal power to negro blood, and they may be more likely to reject the possibility of manipulating physical features to change racial classification. Belmonte residents of all ages construct categories that not only generalize about, but also causally explain disparate types of information such as visual appearance, family history, and social/cultural identity within specific cultural, historical, and situational contexts. Investigating the changes in Belmonte schools and black movement organizations, I propose solutions to the problems of (1) the reification of racial identities in anthropological theory and the tendency to take US-based definitions of race as analytic categories for cross-cultural analysis, (2) the separation of race, ethnicity, nationality, and region as analytically distinct domains of categorization, (3) the treatment of essentialism as a unified cognitive process, and (4) the scholarship that attempts to uncover a single way to understand race in Brazil without taking into account differences of historical trajectory, local context, age cohorts, and individual experience.

Although a number of studies have explored these differences in countries such as Brazil, little research has been done on questions of race and color in Mexico, beyond studies of the Indigenous population. This dissertation begins to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on the role of race and color among Mexico's population. Using participant observation, semi-structured interviews and focus groups, findings from this study provide detailed insights regarding the real life implications of race and color in Veracruz, Mexico. Specifically, I discuss how Veracruzanos reconcile the national ideology of non-racism in Mexico with their everyday lived experiences with discrimination. In addition, I interrogate the meaning of blackness in the region, both in the sense of racial identification and in reference to the construction of the category ""black."" Not only is there extreme hesitancy to identify as ""black"" and a general dismissal of the role individuals of African descent played in Mexico's development, blackness is seen as something foreign to the nation. Furthermore, in this dissertation I discuss the role of color in the region and its relation to the national ideology promoting race mixture, discourses on racism and meanings of blackness. I found that the national ideology is not embraced at the ground level in a way in which the founders intended. Instead, there is a clear trend for individuals to adopt mestizaje [race mixture] as a strategy to whiten themselves within the mixed-race category. Regarding discourses on racism, I describe how Veracruzanos, while being extremely reluctant to talk about racial divisions, engage in a proxy discourse based on color to incorporate such distinctions into everyday conversation. Finally, in relation to blackness, a color-based discourse is used by Veracruzanos to distance themselves from the category ""black.""

The current study, which tested the relation of multiracial identity statuses to psychosocial functioning, was based on the Multiracial - Heritage Awareness and Personal Affiliation (M-HAPA) theory of multiracial identity, developed by Choi-Misailidis (2004). This identity model consists of four multiracial identity statuses: (a) marginal, or lack of affiliation with any racial group, (b) singular, or the affiliation with one racial group to the exclusion of others, (c) integrated-combinatory, or an identification that combines the racial heritages of both parents, and (d) integrated-universality, or a sense of connection with members of other racial groups. Specifically, the purpose of this study was to explore the degree to which the four multiracial identity statuses as defined in the M-HAPA theory differentially predicted self-reported self-esteem, depression, life satisfaction, and social functioning in a national sample of nonclinical multiracial adults. Results indicated that as a group, the four M-HAPA statuses significantly predicted substantial, unique proportions of variance in participants' reported self-esteem, depression, life satisfaction, and social functioning, over and above various demographic factors (i.e., age, annual income, education level, marital status, and current mental health treatment). However, only two of the four identity statuses, marginal and integrated-combinatory, were uniquely associated with the criterion variables. As predicted, the marginal status was associated with relatively poorer psychosocial functioning, whereas the integrated-combinatory was associated with relatively better psychosocial functioning. Moreover, as predicted, no unique relationship was found between singular and levels of depression. As a group, the multiracial identity statuses accounted for the greatest variance in social functioning (21%). All results are tempered by the mediocre fit of the data to the M-HAPA model, as indicated by a confirmatory factor analysis and by the small proportion of the sample endorsing ""some agreement"" with the marginal and singular identity statuses. The results are discussed with respect to theory, research, and practice. Suggestions for further study of this understudied population are provided.

Whereas previous research on intergroup perception found amygdala activity-typically interpreted as negativity-in response to stigmatized social groups, we found greater activity in the amygdala, fusiform gyri, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsal striatum when participants viewed novel in-group faces than when they viewed novel out-group faces. Moreover, activity in orbitofrontal cortex mediated the in-group bias in self-reported liking for the faces. These in-group biases in neural activity were not moderated by race or by whether participants explicitly attended to team membership or race, a finding suggesting that they may occur automatically. This study helps clarify the role of neural substrates involved in perceptual and affective in-group biases.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Historically, the principle of hypodescent specified that individuals with one Black and one White parent should be considered Black. Two experiments examined whether categorizations of racially ambiguous targets reflect this principle. Participants studied ambiguous target faces accompanied by profiles that either did or did not identify the targets as having multiracial backgrounds (biological, cultural, or both biological and cultural). Participants then completed a speeded dual-categorization task requiring Black/not Black and White/not White judgments (Experiments 1 and 2) and deliberate categorization tasks requiring participants to describe the races (Experiment 2) of target faces. When a target was known to have mixed-race ancestry, participants were more likely to rapidly categorize the target as Black (and not White); however, the same cues also increased deliberate categorizations of the targets as ""multiracial."" These findings suggest that hypodescent still characterizes the automatic racial categorizations of many perceivers, although more complex racial identities may be acknowledged upon more thoughtful reflection.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Based on evidence from a French-Wolof phrase book published in Senegal in 1864, this article makes the case that urban Wolof, a variety of the language characterized by significant lexical borrowing from French, is a much older variety than scholars have generally claimed. Historical evidence suggests that urban Wolof emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries in the coastal island city of Saint-Louis du Senegal, France's earliest African settlement and future capital of the colonial entity that would be known as French West Africa. The intimate nature of early contact between African and European populations and the later role played by the metis or mixed-race population of the island as linguistic brokers contributed to a unique, urban variety of Wolof that has important links to today's variety of urban Wolof spoken in Dakar and other cities throughout the country.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"We sought to determine the prevalence of HIV conspiracy beliefs in patients with HIV and how those beliefs correlate with access and adherence to HIV care and health outcomes. From March to December 2005, 113 patients at four public facilities in Houston, Texas, diagnosed with HIV for 3 years or less, participated in a cross-sectional survey. Conspiracy beliefs were assessed with five items that dealt with HIV origin, cure, and vaccine. Medical records were reviewed for CD4 cell counts, HAART use, and appointment dates. Statistical analyses (including analysis of variance [ANOVA], chi2 testing, and regression) determined the predictors of conspiracy beliefs and correlated them with outcomes. Sixty-three percent of the participants endorsed 1 or more conspiracy beliefs. African American patients more often held HIV conspiracy beliefs than white and other/mixed race patients (73%, 52%, 47%; p = 0.045). Persons holding 1 or more conspiracy beliefs had higher CD4 cell counts at diagnosis (254 cells/mm3 versus 92, p = 0.03); and similar rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use (73% versus 71%), 100% adherence to HAART by self-report (53% versus 45%,), mean adherence by pharmacy refill (83% versus 87%), and gaps in care greater than 120 days (49% versus 53%), compared to subjects who did not hold any conspiracy beliefs (all p > 0.40). Since recruitment focused on patients in care, patients with extreme conspiracy beliefs may be underrepresented. Despite this, more than 50% of the study population endorsed 1 or more conspiracy belief. However, these beliefs did not negatively impact access or adherence to HIV care. Efforts to improve adherence to HIV care may not need to focus on eliminating conspiracy beliefs.

Edited Book",Chapter,Textbook/Study Guide,"(from the chapter) In the United States, mixed-race people must either deny their multiracial identity by identifying with only a single race or create an identity that is not recognized or validated by the broader society. Consequently, the core issue facing mixed-race people is how to identify racially and manage the assortment of dynamics, dilemmas, and challenges associated with racial identification in a society that denies and devalues multiracial identity. This chapter examined several family dynamics that commonly undermine or compromise how mixed-race children explore, define, assert, and negotiate their racial identities. Strategies for intervention were presented, including how to support parents in teaching their children how to understand and manage encounters with racism.

And we hope that our story will encourage others to do as David Douglas suggests and move beyond the polarized definitions of race in which our society has become so negatively mired. We illustrate our family's life cycle to highlight common threads with other families while identifying key elements that are unique to our family and perhaps other multiracial families. By sharing our story in this context, we hope to contribute to the subsequent normalization of mixed families. We speak in our separate voices when describing our individual experiences and as ""we"" when we try to convey joint experiences or thinking.

Edited Book",,Textbook/Study Guide,"(from the jacket) This groundbreaking practitioner guide and widely adopted text illuminates how racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression constrain the lives of diverse clients-and family therapy itself Leading thinkers and therapists provide powerful tools for expanding the boundaries of the field and working toward truly inclusive clinical practice. More than a simple update, the second edition has been substantially revised and expanded. Numerous new topics are featured, and 20 chapters are entirely new. Highly readable and engaging, the volume integrates theoretical exposition with case vignettes and evocative autobiographical narratives. It reveals the experiences, challenges, wisdom, and struggles of people whose voices are not often heard in the mainstream literature, including racial minority, intercultural, poor, immigrant, and gay and lesbian families. Contributors discuss the impact of societal discrimination on family relationships, while at the same time exposing the biases that underlie prevailing conceptions of family health and pathology. Concrete suggestions are offered for tapping into clients' cultural resources and conducting culturally competent assessment, treatment, and clinical training. New perspectives and ideas are woven throughout the second edition. In particular, the section in which authors reflect on their own cultural and family legacies-a popular feature among practitioners and students alike-has been significantly expanded. Promoting a fuller understanding not only of cultural diversity but also of the diverse ways that practitioners can support clients' strengths, this book will open the reader to thinking and practicing differently. It is an invaluable text for graduate-level courses.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Between 1980 and 2000, residential segregation between non-Hispanic whites and blacks, as measured by the index of dissimilarity, declined by 8.7 percentage points. How this decline reflects stable racial integration at the neighborhood level remains to be seen. Using the Neighborhood Change Database, which provides 1980, 1990, and 2000 census-tract level data in 2000 boundaries, the descriptive analyses conducted here reveal three findings. First, the declines found in white-black segregation are due to increases in multiethnic neighborhoods rather than mixed white-and-black neighborhoods. Second, the decline in segregation appears not to be due to the fact that multiethnic neighborhoods are forming and remaining stable over time. Instead it is due to the increase in the number of these neighborhoods at one point in time. Finally, when focusing explicitly on the stability of mixed-race neighborhoods, such neighborhoods are less stable when examined over two decades as compared to one decade.

Quintana and Clark McKown (see record 2008-00226-000). The title of their book is apt because the chapters in this book deal with two overlapping topics: (a) children's recognition and self-identification of race and (b) the formation of racial attitudes and the influence of racial bias on children's development and adjustment. Although most of the chapters in this book focus on these topics with respect to children in the United States, researchers' work from Australia, Canada, England, Israel, and the Netherlands is also included. Likewise most of the emphasis is on African Americans, although several chapters address how these topics apply to Latinos, Asian Americans, and those of mixed race. The first half of the book describes and attempts to explain the changes in children's thinking about race, racism, and racial attitudes. The second half of the book examines the outcomes of race and racism in such areas as mental health, academic achievement, and occupational aspirations. This is a good source book for those who want to read the latest thinking and research on race, racism, and children. Thus it will primarily appeal to researchers and graduate students.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, The Global Bell Curve: Race, IQ and Inequality Worldwide by R. Lynn (2008). The theme of the book is an examination of whether the same type of racial hierarchy in IQ and socio-economic status that Herrnstein and Murray documented in the US is present in other parts of the world. The author's new book provides fascinating historical vignettes to describe all the migrations and mixing of peoples. It also provides clear tables of data, which allow the reader to check the facts for themselves. The author argues that these theories are to some degree plausible for some countries, but are often ad hoc and do not explain the world wide consistency of the differences. The conclusion that IQ differences are the crucial determinant of racial socio-economic hierarchies raises the question of what causes the IQ inequalities. In principle, they could be wholly environmentally determined. However, the author argues that their consistency across time and circumstance points to genetic factors. He reviews other data in support including hybridization studies and finds that ""mixed-race"" populations fall between parental populations.

Using a longitudinal data set, we examine the educational expectations of black (African), colored (mixed race), and white (European ancestry) parents and children in Cape Town, South Africa. We find that parents and children have high educational expectations regardless of race, but black parents and children have higher educational expectations than coloreds and whites once socioeconomic and other factors are controlled. We also find that parents' and children's expectations tend to agree more and are more closely correlated among coloreds and whites than blacks. We test two explanations for the educational expectations of parents and children, finding more support for the status attainment perspective among coloreds and whites than blacks and support for the family social capital perspective among blacks and coloreds only.

Social class and social status are continuously explored throughout the book. The book is organized as to provide a logical succession of concepts derived from the previous set. I will confess that much of my fascination with the book may center around my own life experiences growing up and playing ball in a predominantly Catholic, mixed-race, inner-city neighborhood in Chicago. The book was an introspection for me, and that may be one noteworthy reason for why I enjoyed reading it.

Research questions emerged following a review of the literature identifying the ways in which views of self, family, peers and society impact youth and their racial identification. Eight in-depth interviews employing the Long Interview Method were conducted, transcribed and coded to determine themes. Family influences emerged as playing a significant role in biracial identity formation. Three major themes were identified: (1) level of parental awareness and understanding of race issues; (2) impact of family structure; and (3) communication and willingness to talk about race issues. Implications for researchers and social work practitioners working with this population are discussed.

The first prediction is that people of Mixed-Race average between the two parental populations. The second prediction is that the pattern of group means remains consistent over time and place. Data collated on South African university students given the Raven's Standard and Advanced Progressive Matrices confirm the predictions. Combining the results for both versions of the test showed the rank order of group IQ means is East Asians, Whites, South Asians, Coloreds, and Blacks (IQs = 116, 113, 106, 103, and 98, respectively; Ns = 23, 398, 212, 36, and 887).

In our research, we consider how young adults with parents of different racial backgrounds come to rewrite their racial identity, becoming biracial, multiracial, or mixed race. We study the personal narratives of biracial youth to understand how they talk about arriving at these new self-identifications. The personal narrative is an attempt to make sense of the self through time (Cohler, 1998) by organizing experience into an understandable story of the past, present, and future (Ricoeur, 1984). Through the workings of plot, the personal narrative configures the me into a story that conveys a sense of identity (McAdams, 1996).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"In 2003, teachers at the municipal high school in Belmonte, Brazil, began presenting students with a radically different ideology about racial categorization: an essentialized ideology that defines anyone not ""purely"" branco (white) as negro (black). This system of categorization conflicts with popular belief in a mixed-race moreno identity based not only on ancestry but also on observable physical features. Through a combination of ethnographic and experimental methods, I examine this apparent clash of ideologies in Belmonte with respect to academic theories on the cognition of race and ethnicity. I show how children and adults integrate certain aspects of essentialism but not others in their constructions of identity and in the way they reason about hypothetical scenarios. These nuanced solutions to the challenges posed by explicit conflicts over supposedly natural categories lead to my own questioning of race in anthropological theory.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"Reviews the book, Weaving a Family: Untangling Race and Adoption by Barbara Katz Rothman (2005). This is a personal book, more auto-ethnography than memoir. The author grounds her theory in the practice of mothering, race, adoption, and sociology. The author uses mothering (whether performed by women or men), not parenting, as the term for the practices and work of caring for children. Her discussion integrates the complexities of genetic science and genetic ideologies. The child-as-pet theme reflects the traditional relationship of a mother to her small child. The mother indulges her children, but also indulges herself in the joys of nurturing. This is an excellent book for anyone considering transracial adoption or who is a member of a mixed-race family. Those interested in issues of race will benefit from what Weaving a Family teaches us about the tensions between our personal experiences and the social contexts in which they are shaped and interpreted.

Within- and across-case data analytic strategies were used to identify commonalities and variations in how Black men and White women in couple relationships formed their family identities over time. Coming together was the core theme described by the Black-White couples as they negotiated the process of forming a family identity. Four major tasks in the construction of interracial family identity emerged: (a) understanding and resolving family of origin chaos and turmoil, (b) transcending Black-White racial history, (c) articulating the interracial family's racial standpoint, and (d) explaining race to biracial children across the developmental stages. The findings guide family nurses in promoting family identity formation as a component of family health within the nurse-family partnership with Black-White mixed-race families.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Youths growing up in low-income inner-city neighborhoods are at substantial risk for initiating substance use, violent behavior, and sexual intercourse at early ages; these risk behaviors continue at comparatively high rates through adolescence. Hopelessness has been implicated as a risk factor for these behaviors. In this paper, we consider how race influences this process. African Americans form a demographic minority within the United States, but they are often the majority within inner-city neighborhoods. For Caucasians, the opposite typically holds. Mixed-race populations form a minority within both contexts. Using longitudinal data, we examine the relationship between race and risk behaviors in several impoverished inner-city neighborhoods where African Americans form the distinct majority and Caucasians and people of mixed racial heritage form a small minority. We also consider how race moderates the relationship between hopelessness and risk behavior. Our findings show that compared to Caucasian or mixed-race adolescents, African American adolescents are less likely to engage in risk behaviors, and that hopelessness has a less important impact on their behaviors.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"A strategy to modify racial inequality in task groups was tested. Based on social identity literature: If members of a group are encouraged to think of other group members as individuals instead of representatives of a larger group, cross-cutting categorization may decrease the effects of race. Thirty groups of one Black woman and two white women, were randomly assigned to either a condition in which group members knew only that some people did better than others on the task (baseline condition), or a condition in which individualization of group members was emphasized (cross-cutting condition). The task was exactly the same in both conditions; only the description of it varied. Relative to the baseline condition, the cross-cutting condition does not significantly decrease the inequality between Black and white group members. Implications of these results for future research on group racial dynamics are considered.

Vol.68(5-A),2007, pp. 2172.",,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,,"With increasing levels of racial integration the number of mixed-race people in the US will continue to grow (Root, 1992). Mixed-race individuals defy conventional monocultural and monoracial paradigms of understanding identity, and it is imperative that social workers examine the many factors that contribute to the cultural identity of the multiracial person. Through the collection of narrative stories, this qualitative study explored some of the numerous factors that shape a multiracial individual's cultural identity. Purposive sampling methods were employed to recruit a non-clinical sample of 10 multiracial individuals who reside in the Western New York area. Participants were encouraged to share their individual experiences and tell their own unique stories as related to their cultural identity through a narrative interview process (Stuhlmiller, 2001). Results from transcript analysis verify that the cultural identity of multiracial persons is highly complex and significantly influenced by: (1) personal experiences of racism and discrimination; (2) social interactions and relationships with peers and family; and (3) the racial climate of the environment (i.e., schools and neighborhoods). In addition, this study also identified several themes which provide us with a better understanding of what it is like to be a multiracial person. Finally, this study confirmed that certain models of multiracial identity development (those which are more fluid, strength-based and ecological) proved to be more sensitive and therefore more inclined to explicate some of the more complex and highly influential contextual factors that impact a multiracial person's cultural identity development. The findings from this study can help strengthen the therapeutic relationship with multiracial clients throughout the assessment and treatment phases of clinical therapy.

I examine how these women navigate their hybridity, what we can learn from their stories in our efforts to communicate across lines of racial difference, and what experiences the participants share that cross racial and ethnic lines. Data sources include multiple individual and group interviews with predominately middle-class, educated women living in San Francisco/Oakland, Albuquerque, and Boston. I coded the interview transcripts for themes and patterns and situated my analyses in relation to discourses of postcolonial hybridity, multiraciality, and social justice. In relation to navigating hybridity, the women's experiences reveal an interplay between personal agency, claimed through fluid identities, and limitations to social mobility and acceptance created by social, cultural, and institutional structures. When asked or compelled to choose, all participants chose to align themselves with people of color. I identify several factors that contribute to their ability to communicate across lines of racial difference including physical ambiguity, learning about multiple world views early in life, keen observation, and active listening. Several shared experiences emerged that crossed racial lines. The women in my study largely rejected their white identities, experienced their identities in fluid ways despite this rejection, claimed the right to self-identify racially/ethnically, and sought community with other mixed race people. One of the most significant findings is the degree to which many of the participants' stories were dedicated to discussions of cultural whiteness, which they viewed as inextricably linked to racism and white supremacy. This work adds to the small but growing field of mixed race studies and provides information on improving education for social justice. These narratives serve as embodied experiences of hybridity, challenging the disembodied postcolonial hybridity theories prevalent in the literature that disregard the actual lived experiences of ""hybrid""/mixed race people. The stories and analysis also reveal ways in which racism and white privilege are enacted on social and institutional levels, and raise questions about theories of diversity built on racial binaries.

The study sample is comprised of adolescents who are currently incarcerated for various violent offenses, ranging from persistent delinquency to sexual assault (n = 110). A model is proposed that posits that disabilities and cognitive processing are integral to the relation between maltreatment of children and internalizing and externalizing behavior problem. The primary hypothesis of the study tests this mediation model. The relations between cognitive processing, executive function and maltreatment are also examined. The study was conducted during two sessions at a juvenile facility in the State of Michigan using both survey measures and cognitive tasks. The sample was between the ages of 13 and 20 and self-defined as 36% mixed race, 31 Caucasian and 28% African American. Approximately 70% were diagnosed with a disability. Subjects completed both a survey and a cognitive battery. The survey included self-reports of maltreatment, history of violence, self-regulation and mental health. The cognitive battery included a number of aspects of cognition including frontal lobe function, interference processing, response inhibition, task switching, specific learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities. Educational records were obtained. Significant Pearson's correlations were found between seven out of eight subscales of the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and maltreatment history. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the role of cognition and disabilities in the association between maltreatment and internalizing and externalizing behavior. Partial mediation was found between maltreatment and internalizing and externalizing mental health. Relations were found between history of interpersonal violence (IPV) and parent maltreatment and verbal and nonverbal ability and cognition. Self-regulation was associated with internalizing and externalizing behavior. Multiple regressions showed that family violence was associated with cognitive processing and disabilities. Ward Method Squared Euclidian Distance method cluster analysis was used to examine typologies of academic achievement and maltreatment in the population. Six distinct typologies were found. In this population subjects with average maltreatment histories but with low academic achievement were most likely to have internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. Educational, clinical and research implications are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background: Increasing levels of youth obesity constitute a threat to the nation's health, and identification of the influences during childhood that lead to youth obesity is urgently needed. Physical activity is one such influence that is potentially modifiable. Purpose: This study examined the influence of children's social images of other children who engage in physical activity on the development of their own physical activity over 3 years and related growth in physical activity to levels of obesity 2 years later. Methods: Participants (N = 846, 50% female) were members of the Oregon Youth Substance Use Project, a longitudinal study of a community sample. The racial/ethnic composition of the sample was 86% Caucasian; 7% Hispanic; 1% Black; and approximately 2% each of Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Alaskan Native, and other or mixed race/ethnicity. The mean age at the first assessment was 9.5 years. A model examining the effect of early social images on the growth of physical activity (athleticism modeled as a curve of factors) predicting obesity was evaluated using latent growth modeling. Results: More favorable social images predicted the initial levels (i.e., intercept) but not the change over time (i.e., slope) of children's athleticism, and both the intercept and the slope of athleticism predicted obesity. Conclusions: Children's social images of exercise in early childhood influence their subsequent activity levels, and hence obesity, and should be targeted in obesity prevention interventions.

Methods: Data from the 2000 Census of Population, 5% Public Use Microdata Sample, are used to evaluate a multivariate logistic regression model focusing on living with and caring for grandchildren. Particular emphasis is placed on characteristics that may reflect culturally-based ideas about grandparents' responsibility for the care of their grandchildren. Results: Indicators related to Native-American identity--specifically, reporting race as AIAN only rather than mixed race, reporting tribal membership, and living in a nonmetropolitan area of an ""Indian"" state--increase the likelihood of being responsible for a grandchild among Native-American singles and couples aged 45 and over. Conclusions: Cultural and resource characteristics combine to produce high levels of grandparent care giving within the AIAN population. Inasmuch as those with lower educational and economic resources are especially likely to have responsibility for a grandchild, special attention should be directed toward ensuring adequate support for these caregivers.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This qualitative analysis of interviews with women of Thai and non-Thai parentage throws into question the current celebration of Eur/asianness and multiraciality. The study describes multiracialisation as an ambivalent and differential process of categorisation which mobilises essentialist ideas of 'stock' and 'breeding'. A far cry from historical notions of 'mixed-race degeneracy', interviewees emerged from this process the 'best of both worlds'. However, beside the 'good mix' there ran the spectre of the 'bad mix', and some had more access to celebratory identities than others. Celebratory notions of Eur/asian femininity were further qualified by the competing discourse of the 'Thai prostitute'. The precariousness with which interviewees could access normative ideals of desirability was especially visible in narratives of masculinity, non-white parentage, gender variance and childhood. The article ends by advocating, in the place of a power-evasive celebration, challenges to the multiple overlapping power relations which underlie all acts of evaluation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This paper explores the concept of the categorization of social groups by looking at the issue of ascribed categories of identity for children and young people of mixed parentage. Our exploration of the knowledge-base in this area reveals that children and young people have clearly expressed views about their racial identity and that these views are broadly consistent across research studies. In essence, children and young people's expressed views are that they are not mixed-race, black or white, but are in fact brown. The emerging sociology of childhood and the government's current child participation agenda emphasize the centrality of children and young peoples' perspectives on the provision of services that seek to support them. Through this perception, which places children and young people's own understandings of their racial identity at the forefront of the analysis, we added fresh understandings to the existing data concerning ascribed categories of identity for children and young people of mixed parentage.

This article focuses on black beauty as performative through looking at how the discourse of dark skin equals black beauty is destabilized in the talk of 'mixed race' black women. A dark skin shade and natural afro hair become ambiguous signifiers as the women's talk leads to a mobility of black beauty. Their talk is thus an interception in which there can never be a definitive reading of black beauty while also pointing to the binaries of the black anti-racist aesthetics on which they draw. Thus, while women are rooted in racialized and racializing notions of beauty they expand the boundaries of the beautiful black woman's body. Black beauty as an undecidable resists binaries without ever constituting a third term and arises through the disidentification and shame of cultural melancholia.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) In this chapter, the author examines the role of illness and the illnesses experienced in the daily lives of European, African, indigenous, and mixed-race peoples in colonial society in New Spain. Though no concrete numbers exist for children's mortality rates in New Spain, child sickness and death most likely formed an integral part of family and community life in Latin America throughout the colonial period. This chapter analyzes family and community responses to sick children through miraculous healing accounts, where children on the brink of death became healed through what those involved described as divine intervention. Such accounts contain detailed descriptions of children's illnesses, along with family and community healing strategies taken over the course of the sickness.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) This chapter discusses multiracial college students, defined as students whose biological parents are of two or more different racial backgrounds or heritages (Root, 1992). The repeal of laws in the United States that opposed mixed-race coupling or marriages, brought about by the Loving et ux. v. Virginia (1967) Supreme Court decision, has resulted in a dramatic increase in interracial unions. Subsequently, there has also been a dramatic increase in the births of persons of mixed-race heritage. For the first time in its history, the 2000 Census provided persons of mixed-race heritages and backgrounds with the opportunity to describe how they identify racially by selecting more than one racial category (Root & Kelley, 2003). According to data from the 2000 Census, 6.8 million people were identified as being of more than one racial category, or multiracial (Jones & Smith, 2001). The multiracial population is young. Jones and Smith (2003) indicated that approximately 42% of the population is under 18 years of age and close to 70% is under 35 years of age. At the time of the 2000 Census, only 5.4% of the multiracial population was between the ages of 18 and 20; however, a dramatic increase is expected in the near future. Although all children do not aspire to attend college, these figures suggest that the number of multiracial individuals who will be attending college could also show a dramatic increase (Paladino, 2004).

Emerson, with Rodney M. Woo (see record 2006-07915-000). According to the authors, those most likely to attend segregated churches are Blacks in rural churches, with lower-than-average educational levels (p. 162). Who attends racially diverse churches? The authors state that ""people of mixed-race congregations are, on average, considerably different from other Americans"" (p. 97), ""people who seem to flow across racial categories and divisions"" (p. 6). So much so, in fact, that Emerson invents a new term for them: ""Sixth Americans"" (p. 99) who do not fit socially into one of Emerson's five racial categories of Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American. Emerson is very clear that it is multiracial, not multiethnic, groups he is interested in. The book concentrates on Protestant churches, which is not surprising, given their marked differences in size and polity from Catholic churches. However, Catholic congregations pop in and out of the picture irregularly. Exactly where the Mormons, the fourth largest denominational group in the United States, fit in is unclear; aside from a passing reference to research on Black Mormons (p. 122) they do not appear. A graph concerning the relation between ""level of market share"" and ""level of segregation"" (p. 42) includes only the categories of Catholic, mainline Protestants, conservative Protestants, and non-Christians. The topic of multiracial congregations is certainly one worthy of research. A search of the Sommervogel Archive, a bibliography of over 60,000 in the social scientific study of religion (Donahue, 1999), produced only 10 relevant references when looking for the words racial, multiracial, or multi-racial in the title of dissertations, journal articles, and contributions to edited volumes. Emerson's own research combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to examining these congregations.

Edited Book",,,"(from the cover) This book is a groundbreaking anthology on the role of communication in the construction and performance of sexualities in interpersonal contexts and in public discourses. Editors Karen E. Lovaas and Mercilee M. Jenkins bring together an interdisciplinary collection that include excerpts from foundational works, recent journal articles, and original pieces written specifically for this text. This collection (1) assists students in understanding the intersections of sexuality with other identity constructions; (2) introduces the concepts and implications of queer theory; (3) challenges students to move beyond stereotypical, dichotomous views of homosexual and heterosexual identities and communication styles; and, (4) facilitates students' awareness of and ability to recognize heteronormativity. An introductory chapter provides a thorough review of literature to date on communication and sexualities and acquaints the reader with five of the major theoretical frameworks in this scholarship. In the four sections that follow, there is a logical flow from the foundational materials, to the examinations of sexuality in one's everyday vocabulary, interactions, and relationships, to wider social discourses, to interventions, praxis, and future visions. In addition, discussion questions accompany each reading to spark personal reflection and application.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of drinking, binge drinking (4 or more drinks), and alcohol abuse and dependence and to identify predictors of heavier drinking among women of child-bearing age (18-44 years). Methods: Subjects are part of a national multistage random sample from the 2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Results: Binge drinking, abuse, and dependence are higher in younger (<30 years) pregnant and nonpregnant women. Among pregnant women, binge drinking is highest among Whites; alcohol abuse and dependence rates are relatively low and similar in all racial/ethnic groups. Among nonpregnant women, Whites and mixed race women have the highest rates of binge drinking. Alcohol abuse and dependence are highest among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, followed by Native American/Alaska Native women. Women who are White, younger (21-29 years), single, or cohabiting and with a higher income (>$40,000) are at a higher risk for heavier drinking. Conclusions: Drinking and heavier drinking remain at high levels among women of child-bearing age. Prevention efforts must be comprehensive and should target pregnant women who are drinking and those who could become pregnant and are drinking at high-risk levels.

The normal developmental tasks of the later teenage years often appear overwhelmingly daunting to adopted adolescents, who must deal with an inner world peopled both by birth and adoptive families. Painful feelings of early loss are revived and intensified confusion and dissonance can predominate in the face of the necessity for separation. It is suggested that late adolescence is a particularly fruitful time for work on the fundamentals of who one is.

Cultural hybrid phenomenology was explored, and its connection to related concepts including third culture kids, global nomads, transculturals, cosmopolitans, and people of ""mixed race"" was examined. The challenge this population poses for traditional identity constructs such as ""nationality,"" ""ethnicity,"" and ""race"" was emphasized. Drawing from the life-stories and reflections of four prominent cultural hybrid writers as well as from relevant interdisciplinary research findings, five common themes of cultural hybrid experience emerged: cultural marginality, hidden diversity, fluidity of identity, multidimensional worldview, and non-traditional ways of belonging. Existing conceptualizations of cultural hybridity were presented, and creative marginality, a concept informed by an integration of these conceptualizations with notions of the creative self in the psychoanalytic theories of Winnicott, Klein and Bollas, is introduced. Within the stance of creative marginality, it is suggested that the cultural hybrid's sense of belonging is not to any one cultural group or entity, but to a creative, open, and flexible ""way of being in the in-between"" reminiscent of Winnicott's concept of play . The presence of a facilitating environment that refrains from a coercive, ""either/or"" worldview, and is able to see, be curious about, and reflect back all of who the cultural hybrid is and wants to be is proposed to be of critical significance to the ability to develop and sustain creative marginality. Implications of a comprehensive understanding of the cultural hybrid phenomenon for the field of psychology, including clinical practice, ""diversity"" training, and future research, are presented. The study concludes with a discussion of the wider significance of cultural hybridity.

Keeping with the format traditionally used in the American Psychological Association (APA) videotape series, the video is essentially divided into three sections. The didactic portions of the video are conducted through dialogue between Root and her host, Jon Carlson. Root begins by explaining the necessity for a clinical framework for clients with mixed-race identities, and she explains the conceptual framework she developed to meet the unique needs of this client group. Root then carries out a practice session with a client, which is followed by commentary on various portions of the session that provide context for important considerations when working with clients from this population.

Methods: A longitudinal cohort of newly homeless youth from Los Angeles County (n = 261; ages 12-20 years) were followed for 24 months. Youth were interviewed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and asked about their background, housing situation, emotional distress (using the Brief-Symptom Inventory), substance use, sexual risk behaviors, and their STD testing rates. We modeled our longitudinal data using logistic random effects models. Results: Characteristics of homeless youth that were associated with STD testing in our multivariate model included time in study (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.6), age at baseline (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4), being African-American (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.3), being from a mixed race/ethnic group (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-5.8), self-identifying as a gay/bisexual male (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.9), self-identifying as a heterosexual female (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.7), using amphetamines (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6), and history of having gotten someone/becoming pregnant (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.9). Youth who lived in an apartment were less likely to have received an STD test than youth who lived in other types of housing (OR .4, 95% CI .2-.9). Sexual risk behaviors such as inconsistent condom use (OR 1.0, 95% CI .6-1.4) and number of sexual partners over past 3 months (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.1) were not predictive of STD testing over time. Conclusions: A need exists for interventions to target young newly homeless youth who engage in high-risk sexual behaviors to increase their STD testing rates and thereby decrease their risk for HIV infection.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Background: Little is known about the patterning of neighborhood characteristics, beyond the basic urban, rural, suburban trichotomy, and its impact on physical activity (PA) and overweight. Methods: Nationally representative data (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 1994-1995, n =20,745) were collected. Weight, height, PA, and sedentary behavior were self-reported. Using diverse measures of the participants' residential neighborhoods (e.g., socioeconomic status, crime, road type, street connectivity, PA recreation facilities), cluster analyses identified homogeneous groups of adolescents sharing neighborhood characteristics. Poisson regression predicted relative risk (RR) of being physically active (five or more bouts/week of moderate to vigorous PA) and overweight (body mass index equal or greater than the 95th percentile, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics growth curves). Results: Six robust neighborhood patterns were identified: (1) rural working class; (2) exurban; (3) newer suburban; (4) upper-middle class, older suburban; (5) mixed-race urban; and (6) low-socioeconomic-status (SES) inner-city areas. Compared to adolescents living in newer suburbs, those in rural working-class (adjusted RR[ARR]=1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.13-1.69), exurban (ARR=1.30, CI=1.04-1.64), and mixed-race urban (ARR=1.31, CI=1.05-1.64) neighborhoods were more likely to be overweight, independent of individual SES, age, and race/ethnicity. Adolescents living in older suburban areas were more likely to be physically active than residents of newer suburbs (ARR=1.11, CI=1.04-1.18). Those living in low-SES inner-city neighborhoods were more likely to be active, though not significantly so, compared to mixed-race urban residents (ARR=1.09, CI=1.00-1.18). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate disadvantageous associations between specific rural and urban environments and behavior, illustrating important effects of the neighborhood on health and the inherent complexity of assessing residential landscapes across the United States. Simple classical urban-suburban-rural measures mask these important complexities.

Authored Book",,,"(from the jacket) It is sometimes said that the most segregated time of the week in the United States is Sunday morning. Even as workplaces and public institutions such as the military have become racially integrated, racial separation in Christian religious congregations is the norm. And yet some congregations remain stubbornly, racially mixed. People of the Dream is the most complete study of this phenomenon ever undertaken. Author Michael Emerson explores such questions as: how do racially mixed congregations come together? How are they sustained? Who attends them, how did they get there, and what are their experiences? Engagingly written, the book enters the worlds of these congregations through national surveys and in-depth studies of those attending racially mixed churches. Data for the book was collected over seven years by the author and his research team. It includes more than 2,500 telephone interviews, hundreds of written surveys, and extensive visits to mixed-race congregations throughout the United States. People of the Dream argues that multiracial congregations are bridge organizations that gather and facilitate cross-racial friendships, disproportionately housing people who have substantially more racially diverse social networks than do other Americans. The book concludes that multiracial congregations and the people in them may be harbingers of racial change to come in the United States.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The effects of defendant race, victim race, and juror gender on sentencing and information processing were examined within the context of a murder trial. A sample consisting of 96, jury eligible White Australians read one of four versions of a real trial transcript, in which the race of a male defendant and female victim were varied. The participants imposed the severest sentences on the Indigenous (Black) defendant. Jurors were most lenient with White defendants who killed a White victim. Female jurors were more punitive than the males toward the Indigenous defendant. Jurors processed evidence systematically in same-race trials, but used both systematic and heuristic processing in mixed-race trials. In these instances, female jurors employed significantly more emotive responses, especially when the victim was Black. The effects of subtle racism and the black processing effect when the victim was non-White are considered.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Letter,,"This letter to the editor discusses self-reported race and genetic admixture. The authors of this letter argue that the use of self-reported race in health research is debatable. They cite several other authors who have discussed the limitations in research analysis, inappropriate classifications of groups, and the use of suboptimal model for genetic cluster analysis. Despite advances in genetic analysis, clinicians and epidemiologists still disagree on the usefulness of race in clinical reporting. Sinha et al present data from an admixture analysis study they did on a sample population. The specifics of the study are explained. Although the need for cautious interpretation of racial data is indisputable, genetic analyses show that self-reported race is informative for the classification of genetic clusters. Although self-reported blacks in the United States are largely of mixed race, genetic admixture analyses show clear differences between self-reported blacks and whites, indicating that self-reported race provides a means for identifying distinct groups.

Results show that EAT scores were significantly higher for Asians and Muslims and for mixed-race Ss than for White or African Caribbean Ss. Adjusted odds ratios for having a very high EAT score were 2.4 in Asians and Muslims and 2.9 in mixed-race Ss, compared to White Ss. Having only one parent employed was also independently associated with a very high EAT score, compared with having both parents employed. Similar associations were found for a moderately high EAT score and for a combination of low self-esteem and high EAT score. Low self-esteem and depressed mood were independently associated with a high EAT score. Overall, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, self-esteem, and depression, but not gender, were independently associated with eating attitudes. It is stated that effects of cultural and socioeconomic stresses on eating disorders may be mediated through depressed mood and low self-esteem.

The DATOS was a naturalistic, prospective cohort study that collected data from 1991-1993 in 96 programs in 11 cities in the US. Data were analyzed to determine the effects of anxiety on the TMT scores A and B, and also derived indices created by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing parts A and B of the TMT in this large treatment sample of cocaine abusers. The variables of sex, age, ethnicity, and education were included in analyses to control for demographic effects.

A mixed-race sample of 259 Ss (aged 18 yrs and over) was drawn from electronic files of data from the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS). The DATOS was a naturalistic, prospective cohort study that collected data from 1991 to 1993 in 96 programs in 11 cities in the US. Data were analyzed to determine the effects of demographic variables on derived indices created by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing Parts A and B of the TMT in this large treatment sample of marijuana abusers. The variables of age, ethnicity, and education were statistically significant for the total (A+B), and interaction (AxB/100) derived indices of the TMT. The difference score (B-A) was significant only for ethnicity and the ratio score (B/A) was not significant for any demographic variable.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The Trail Making Test (TMT) is often used for screening cognitive impairments in substance abusers. A possible limitation of the TMT in clinical settings is that substance abusers may malinger and give poor effort. In this study, previously validated cutting scores for malingering were applied to a sample of 7,689 substance abusers (aged 18-44+ yrs) in drug abuse treatment programs. A mixed race sample was drawn from electronic files of data from the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study. Data were analyzed to determine the number of substance abusers that fell beyond the preset malingering cutting scores on the TMT. Results indicate that the TMT variables of seconds to complete Part A and Part B, and the ratio score of Part B divided by Part A (B/A), ranged from no subjects beyond the preset cutting score for Part B to 2.28% for Part A to 9.74% for the ratio score. Most substance abusers fell within preset cutting score ranges, a finding that suggests that their scores are valid. Another interpretation of the data, however, is that the cutoff scores were not particularly sensitive to biased responding. Further research is indicated.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) This chapter focuses on the problematization of hybridity in psychology and the human sciences. Academic problematization is the process by which groups or individuals are made into a problem. Historically women, various ""races,"" gay men and lesbians, mentally ill persons, and other groups have been transformed into problems in the human sciences. Analyses of problematization seek to reconstruct when, why, and how a particular problematization took place, but the focus of this chapter will be on the ""how""--that is, the techniques of problematization. The chapter will not answer exactly when hybridity became a problem in the course of Western history or how the discourses on hybridity as a biological, psychological, cultural, and political problem shifted over time. Instead, I am more interested in the conceptual and empiricist techniques that were construed, used, and repeated to make hybridity a problem. I hope to provide some understanding by tracing a few of these techniques from the Enlightenment to the present.

Edited Book",,,"(from the publicity materials) This is the first book to bring together recent scholarship on the history of psychology and race. Throughout the history of the field, psychological discourse has been shaped by social concerns, and its discourse on race is no exception. Psychologists have both promoted and fought against racism, and a nuanced historical account requires analysis of both dimensions. The contributors seek to understand the relationship between the changes in the field and broader social change by mapping the changing discourse for ""defining difference"" through race. Topics covered include essentialism and the history of the concept of race, ideas of race in the work of nineteenth-century and twentieth-century psychologists, psychological discourse on topics such as ""mixed-race"" people, political uses of racial research, changes in textbook presentations of race and intelligence, and international perspectives on psychology and race. Contributors also examine the prominence and persistence of American research on racial differences in intelligence as well as the work of Kenneth Clark and Horace Mann Bond in combating racism in science and society. This important volume increases readers' understanding of the link between racial studies and social attitudes in our time.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Averaged face composites, which represent the central tendency of a familiar population of faces, are attractive. If this prototypicality contributes to their appeal, then averaged composites should be more attractive when their component faces come from a familiar, own-race population than when they come from a less familiar, other-race population. We compared the attractiveness of own-race composites, other-race composites, and mixed-race composites (where the component faces were from both races). In experiment 1, Caucasian participants rated own-race composites as more attractive than other-race composites, but only for male faces. However, mixed-race (Caucasian/Japanese) composites were significantly more attractive than own-race composites, particularly for the opposite sex. In experiment 2, Caucasian and Japanese participants living in Australia and Japan, respectively, selected the most attractive face from a continuum with exaggerated Caucasian characteristics at one end and exaggerated Japanese characteristics at the other, with intervening images including a Caucasian averaged composite, a mixed-race averaged composite, and a Japanese averaged composite. The most attractive face was, again, a mixed-race composite, for both Caucasian and Japanese participants. In experiment 3, Caucasian participants rated individual Eurasian faces as significantly more attractive than either Caucasian or Asian faces. Similar results were obtained with composites. Eurasian faces and composites were also rated as healthier than Caucasian or Asian faces and composites, respectively. These results suggest that signs of health may be more important than prototypicality in making average faces attractive.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"While studies of racial residential preferences generally converge on the pattern that blacks prefer neighborhoods with a substantial proportion of African Americans, but whites are uncomfortable with no more than 20% black, the forces underlying these preferences receive comparatively less empirical attention. This paper uses perceptions of community undesirability as a measure of racial residential preferences to address this question. Data come from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, which asked large samples of whites and African Americans in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles to rate the desirability of 5-7 local communities. In addition to the closed-ended ratings, this paper draws on a systematic analysis of open-ended survey data asking respondents to explain why they find communities undesirable. Overall, blacks rate most communities as more desirable than whites, and African Americans find desirable many of the communities in which they are the numerical minority. Whites rate mixed race communities as undesirable, in part because of a desire to avoid black neighbors, but also because of what may be an over-inflated perception of crime in those communities. Analyses of African American community ratings highlight the importance of racial climate in shaping perceptions of communities and argue against the assertion that racial composition alone is the key factor in black preferences.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"In this article, I explore issues of authenticity, legal discourse, and local requirements of belonging by considering the recent surge of indigenous recognitions in northeastern Brazil. I investigate how race and ethnicity are implicated in the recognition process in Brazil on the basis of an analysis of a successful struggle for indigenous identity and access to land by a group of mixed-race, visibly, African-descended rural workers. I propose that the debate over mestizaje (ethnoracial and cultural mixing) in the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America can be reconfigured and clarified by broadening it to include such Brazilian experiences. I argue that the interaction between two processes--law making and indigenous identity formation--is crucial to understanding how the notion of ""mixed heritage"" is both reinforced and disentangled. As such, this article is an illustration of the role of legal discourse in the constitution of indigenous identities and it introduces northeastern Brazil into the global discussion of law, indigenous rights, and claims to citizenship.

Nonverbal communication patterns were coded and compared between the same-race and mixed-race groups. Results indicated that Black and White males were significantly different in their display of adaptors in the same-race groups. In part two, 40 Black and 35 White males completed the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Anorexia nervosa (AN), once thought to be a problem of wealthier, Western countries has now been documented in survey studies and case reports across geographic and economic groups; however, few epidemiological studies including interview have been done on these populations. We report on a comprehensive study on Curacao, a Caribbean island in economic transition, where the majority of the population is of predominantly black African origin. As part of an epidemiological study on the island of Curacao indigenous cases of AN were identified. Participants were interviewed and asked to complete standardized measures of eating behaviors and cultural attitudes. In addition, matched controls completed the same measures and were seen in a focus group to assess their knowledge of eating disorders and perceived current and future challenges to young Curacao women. Six of the nine indigenous cases of AN were successfully traced; all were of mixed race. No cases of anorexia were found among the majority black population. The women with AN were from the high-education and high-income sectors of the society and the majority had spent time overseas. The women with a history of anorexia reported higher levels of perfectionism and anxiety than the matched controls. All of the women reported challenges to maintaining an active professional and personal life and viewed themselves as different from the norm. Women who presented with AN evidenced vulnerability to a triple threat to identity formation: (1) they were of mixed race, aspiring to fit into the mobile elite (and mostly white) subgroup while distancing themselves from the black majority; (2) they had the means for education and travel that left them caught between modern and traditional constructs of femininity; and (3) they had lived overseas, and therefore struggled upon reentry with the frustrations of what was possible within the island culture. The race, class and overseas exposures of the women with anorexia were anything but typical on the island. Cases of anorexia in other developing countries may similarly be limited to specific subgroups, which require specialized treatment and planning efforts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Presents a clinical case report of approaching homosexuality in a 15-year-old mixed-race boy (""JM"") with anxiety and depression. He reported that his anxiety had been growing progressively worse since enrolling in a nearby vocational high school. He endorsed multiple depressive symptoms, including sadness and hopelessness, loss of interest, poor concentration, decreased energy, and increased sleep and appetite, with a 30-pound weight gain over several months. He had experienced occasional passive suicidal ideation, however, he denied any history of self-injurious behavior. The clinicians discuss the complications that may arise in an initial encounter with an adolescent dealing with issues of sexual identity with the reference of JM's case. The exploration of adolescents' sexuality and of positive and negative feelings about their sexual orientation should take place in a therapeutic relationship in which the therapist can remain neutral. Premature closure of the therapist's thinking about an adolescent's sexual orientation may be harmful. It should also be noted how important it is for the therapist to help the gay adolescent find positive role models. While gender identity and sexual orientation are sensitive issues, especially for an adolescent, clinicians must inquire about them in the same caring, nonjudgmental manner as any other aspect of the patient's life.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This paper looks at some of the problems concerning access of Black people to NHS Psychotherapy Departments. It examines some of the clinical issues that can arise in offering treatment to Black patients, including racism. It argues that in addressing these issues improvements could be made to services, so that Black people have a better and more equal chance (as compared to their White counterparts) of specialist psychotherapeutic help. The term 'Black' is being used in a broad context to signify different from white and to include African-Caribbean, Asian and mixed race people. These issues are inevitably emotionally charged and difficult to write about without stirring up uncomfortable feelings in the reader. As Bion (1962) understood, thinking is an emotional experience and, in thinking about race and inequalities in psychotherapy services, minus K can come into force--it can feel easier not to know. A clinical example is used to illustrate awareness of racism as an internal reality and that working with these issues helped to prevent the premature departure of a Black patient from therapy.

Within the last two decades, researchers have found that the majority of mixed-race individuals are psychologically healthy, experience similar life events as other people of color, and encounter additional discrimination and stresses due to their mixed-race status. The experiences of mixed-race women differ from mixed-race men along several dimensions: belonging and acceptance, physical appearance, cultural stereotypes, ethnic identity, power and guilt, and dating and marriage. It is important for mental health practitioners to understand how these experiences affect a mixed-race woman's life.

Edited Book",,,"(from the introduction) The papers in this volume represent different levels of insight into the experience of being a biracial woman. Some authors present experiences that are unique to biracial women, while others focus on areas of experience that are common among both biracial women and men. Some are very personal/intimate expressions of the complexity of finding a biracial identity without a supportive community. Each provides a building block to the construction of theory and practice in work with biracial women. We thought it was important to include diverse perspectives on a very complex set of issues related to biracial women. We invite readers to engage in both internal and interactive dialogues about the issues raised in these papers, taking no conclusion at face value, but examining all with a critical and integrative eye. In the following overview, we will point out areas of contrast and agreement in perspective among some of the authors and we encourage the reader to do the same. We hope that by doing so, new questions will emerge that can be researched and that will contribute to our greater understanding of biracial women and the ways that gender affects their experiences.

The focus of this investigation is on whether, and to what extent, this assimilation can be observed in interviewees' discourse and, moreover, whether the speakers' self-concepts entail their incorporation of ""criminal"" as an aspect of Black identity. Using social construction, post-colonial and cultural transmission theories to inform this analysis, interviews are inspected to determine whether and to what extent stereotypical views of Black persons are constitutive of the subjects' views of themselves. Findings suggest not only that the persons under study here recognize such stereotypes, but also that they adopt and embrace them.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The focus of this literature review is on family identity formation within a social cultural context for families, couples, and women who are in committed Black-White interracial relationships that include biracial children. This review and synthesis of interdisciplinary literature was limited to U.S. research studies completed between 1990 and 2002. The American racial lens represented the environmental context that this article seeks to capture. Health care providers lack knowledge of this complex mixed-race family identity formation and its implications for healthy interracial families. Family nurses who can assess and intervene in a culturally competent manner will be essential to promoting health and eliminating health disparities for these interracial families of color.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Objective: To evaluate psychometric properties and response patterns of the Caregiver Assessment of Function and Upset (CAFU), a 15-item multidimensional measure of dependence in dementia patients and caregiver reaction. Method: 640 families were administered the CAFU (53% White, 43% African American, and 4% mixed race and ethnicity). We created a random split of the sample and conducted exploratory factor analyses on Sample 1 and confirmatory factor analyses on Sample 2. Convergent and discriminant validity were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Results: A two-factor structure for functional items was derived, and excellent factorial validity was obtained. Convergent and discriminant validity were obtained for function and upset measures. Differential response patterns for dependence and caregiver upset were found for caregiver race, relationship, and care recipient gender but not for caregiver gender. Discussion: The CAFU is easily administered, reliable, and valid for evaluating appraisals of dependencies and upsetting care areas.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 6.8 million people, or 2.4% of the national population, identified themselves by two or more races (i.e., biracial or multiracial; Jones & Smith, 2001). Nearly 1.8 million of these individuals reported being Black or African American in combination with another racial or ethnic group. Reported population figures regarding biracial African Americans, however, may be underestimations of the actual size of this population (Brown, 1995; Root, 1996). In particular, the degree to which parents of interracial children address their children's racial group orientation and how people of mixed race heritage identify with either or both racial groups may influence population estimates (Winn & Priest, 1993). In this chapter, we provide some background information pertaining to the historical and current experiences of biracial and multiracial African Americans. We also discuss considerations in the self-identification process for biracial and multiracial African Americans, and we present several prominent identity development models for biracial and multiracial people. In addition, we present issues that mental health counselors might wish to consider when working with biracial and multiracial African Americans.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Anglo-Indian women have been described as 'mixed-race' and 'hybrid'. This paper explores the identity of 26 Anglo-Indian women in Western Australia. The process of immigration to and settlement in Australia provides a major focus. Two components of identity that emerged were perceptions about skin colour and Indian heritage. 22 women who participated in this study emigrated from India between 1947 and 1996. Four other women were Australian-born. This qualitative study involved in-depth, semi-structured interviews with the participants who expressed varying levels of identification with Anglo-Indian identity. Realisations about prejudice and discrimination came to the fore during the interview process. This paper picks up on these realisations, investigates the social environments within which they developed and their implications for the identities of Anglo-Indian women.

Vol.65(11-A),2005, pp. 4346.",,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,,"An estimated 1.5 million women are abused by intimate partners annually. There is significant empirical evidence that remaining in abusive relationships has long-term negative physical and emotional effects on abused women and their children. Although women are able to leave abusive relationships, an estimated that 50% of these women return to their partners; and between 1/4 and 3/4 of abused women are unable to leave permanently. This research used qualitative and quantitative methods and a longitudinal design to test the efficacy of the theory of planned behavior in exploring the elements of the complex decision process of abused women with regard to staying or leaving. A volunteer sample of 69 abused women recruited from communities in upstate New York completed initial questionnaires and follow-up instruments 6 weeks later. A subset of 25 women participated in a qualitative interview component to provide context for the quantitative data. Findings confirmed that the stay/leave decision is a well-considered cognitive process for most abused women and validated the efficacy of the theory of planned behavior decision schema (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) in predicting stay/leave behavioral intentions and behaviors in the 6 week timeframe. A woman's perception of her ability to implement her intention made the most significant contribution to the decision. Data analyses failed to determine specific belief structures underpinning the three decision model components. However, other data analyses pointed to the importance of relationship quality, safety, and children's well-being, as well as the availability of environmental and social supports as factors influencing the decision. Additional data analyses suggested that a woman's contribution to the family income and issues related to ethnicity, particularly being of mixed race are decision factors meriting further exploration. Findings validated the decision as a complex, repetitive cognitive process in which abused women actively engage over the course of their relationships once they identify their relationships as abusive. Quantitative and qualitative evidence pointed to significant influence of professional and peer support in domestic violence programs in enabling women to leave and the importance of follow-up services to help women remain out of abusive relationships.

The variation in these parental designations of a variety of mixed-race children is described. Parental racial designations in the three most common majority-minority interracial couplings - White/Hispanic, Black/White and Asian/White - are predicted using multinomial logistic regression models. The results may indicate a movement by the parents of these multiracial children away from minority status through racial labeling and towards ""multiracial"" and ""White"" - movements that are predicated upon gender, class and context. Critical discussions of the implications of these results as well as directions for future research are offered.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This article, which utilizes personal experience as well as other perspectives and theories on race and mixed race, suggests that multiracial identity is a manifestation of recent date that differs from traditional conceptions and descriptions of mixed race that conform to the dichotomous and hierarchical logic of the binary racial system. As delineated in this article, the emergence of multiracial identity is properly understood in the context of the post-civil rights era and has been coextensive with multiculturalism, the proliferation of information technologies, and with the emergence of the multiracial political movement in the 1990s. Further, this article suggests that multiracial identity is also in part a by-product of multicultural American universities of the 1980s and 1990s. That is, multiracial identity has to a certain extent taken shape in reaction to the rigid ethnoracial boundaries and discourses that are imposed on mixed race students in the multicultural academy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This paper focuses on the educational experiences of a group of African Caribbean and mixed 'race' young people from the perspectives of their parents. The discussion is set within a national context where children of African Caribbean origin are one of the lowest achieving minority ethnic groups in the UK and are disproportionately one of the highest ethnic groups of children excluded from school. The parents recount a pattern of cumulative negative experiences which for many of the children results in academic underachievement and becoming demotivated to learn, by a system that they feel has rejected them, or imposed exclusion. The story is hardly new but it provides important further evidence that schools need to tackle head-on factors such as low teacher expectations and negative stereotyping of young black people and their contribution to black underachievement.

Following a brief review of some research, the author points out several areas of concern for both researchers and applied psychologists. Themes/concepts of culture conflict, acculturation and dual socialization, formation of personal and social identities, self-image and coping strategies; all need further exploration to work out their associations with psychosomatic illnesses. Also noted is an unexplored area of research, namely the psychological concerns and perceptions of girls (and boys) of dual cultural heritage or mixed race, as they could be bridge-builders between the host society and new citizens/immigrants. It is concluded that the importance of cultural awareness and understanding when counseling young people of Asian ancestry, or other minority groups, cannot be overstated.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) First and foremost, I am a happily obsessed mother of two--not atypical among older and intellectual types. I am also single by choice, German by birth, part of a mixed-race family through life's interesting turns (my two adopted sons are African American), and, based on my university position, a resident alien (I could go on and on about being a quirky alien, but that's best left for another essay). And I'd like to stress one significant element in this puzzle right from the start: Without the flexibility of an academic schedule, it would have been nearly impossible for me to both continue a rewarding professional and international life (living months on end in Germany) and spend lots of formative baby time (plus now preschool time) with my sons. So I am very grateful to academia. Nonetheless, there are still countless ways to help the typical university environment grow into a more family-friendly one. And this is precisely what inspired me to contribute to this volume, because over my 20 years in academia I have observed far too many incidents of ""antifamily"" structures and acts. It is not enough to have a ""family leave"" policy at any given academic institution, although it is a necessary first step. For any reader contemplating a parental leave in the future, I hope to provide a model or two that go beyond the individual and anecdotal. My experiences with the ""powers that be"" were unique, frustrating, funny, and--in the end--supportive, which I hope will make this an interesting narrative. I mainly hope to show elements any new academic-parent-to-be could use to plan for a smoother transition from a more traditionally male academic role to a more inclusive one.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"In many respects, issues surrounding 'mixed-race' identities rupture and dislocate much current thinking within post-race and new ethnicities paradigms. This article seeks to critically engage with what is arguably a marginalized and diverse 'community'. An evaluation of theories emanating from the UK and USA seeks to challenge hybrid degenerative theories, and more recent attempts at explaining how such identities are negotiated in complex social arenas. What emerges is that some theories are underpinned by static and linear behavioural patterns, which appear oversimplified. Key questions are raised in order to further explore whether 'mixed-race' identities are genuinely marginalized and remain ambiguous in a range of physical, social, emotional and ideological contexts. Reflecting upon such issues seeks to prompt questions as to whether there can be a more sophisticated and sensitive understanding of the unique experiences (both positive and negative) of 'mixed-race' individuals. By doing so, it is hoped that such a topic becomes more central to considerations of how prejudice and discrimination operate across and within a wide variety of settings.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Given the very large proportion of Hawaiians who are multiracial, our research examines Native Hawaiian identification in mixed-race Hawaiian families. We use the 1990 US Census, which affords a unique look at racial identification because multiracial people were required to choose one race over another. The results show support for our argument that place plays a central role in Pacific identity processes, illustrated in this case among Hawaiians. We find that strong ties to Hawaii - the spiritual and geographic home of the Hawaiian population - are vital to the intergenerational transmission of Hawaiian identification in both continental and island multiracial families. We compare our results for multiracial Native Hawaiians to prior studies of American Indians and Asian Americans to identify any general patterns in correlates of racial identification choices. In each group, we find that familial and geographic relationships to the cultural and ancestral lands are strongly linked to racial identification.

It also examined the sample members' relative levels of interest in child-specific advertisements that featured youngsters of specific ages, ethnicities and possessing various forms of disability (physical, psychological or behavioural). Interviews were conducted with individuals of the type targeted by an inner-London local government social services department in venues currently displaying the department's child-specific advertisements. The respondents were generally supportive of child-specific advertising, although older people and individuals of African or African-Caribbean heritage tended to be less enthusiastic about the practice than the rest of the sample. It emerged that behavioural problems were regarded as a more unattractive impairment than either a physical disability or a psychological difficulty. Single people, the less well educated, females, white and mixed-race respondents, and persons with highly altruistic dispositions exhibited significantly different preference structures vis-a-vis alternative combinations of attributes (age, ethnicity and form of impairment) associated with children requiring adoption. The findings should assist managers of local government adoption units to draft child-specific advertisements in manners that maximise the probability of their securing substantial numbers of serious enquiries from particular target audiences.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(create) In this article, Leary notes the value of traditional psychoanalytic modes of understanding race and its dynamics through the use of projective mechanisms as a way of understanding racism and stereotyping. But from the outset she argues that race (and she likens this to work on gender) is always personal and political, social and intrapsychic, the province of psychoanalysis and of social theory. Within this essay, turning a psychoanalytic lens on the field itself, she notes that race, arguably the most pressing social problem of the past 200 years, is often a silenced presence in clinical dyads with mixed race and in the writing of the field at large. As analysts, we must appreciate immediately the meanings potentiated in the silences Leary notices. Her clinical vignette shows the careful, difficult work of making voice where silence prevails. The vignette also illuminates the power of voicing hidden fantasies and meaning for many areas of psychic functioning. Finally, notice in her Afterword that Leary is thinking about writing. Any essay is both a progress report of the writer's thinking and another turn in a conversation that becomes more and more complex and interesting. It is certainly a very relational way to be thinking about writing. And this is a way of thinking also grounded in the particular kind of American pragmatism. Meaning and validity are adjudicated in a process of respectful and engaged conversation, addressed to the past surely but more crucially to the present and to future interlocutors.

Methods: Data come from a probability sample of 39,250 adults 18 years of age and older interviewed by the U.S. National Household Survey on Drug Abuse in 2000. Interviews averaging 1 h in length were conducted in respondents' homes by trained interviewers. The survey response rate was 74%. Results: Self-reported rates of DUI were highest among White men (22%), Native American/Native Alaskan men (20.8%) and men of Mixed race (22.5%). Twelve-month arrest rates for DUI were highest among men of Mixed race (5%) and Native American/Native Alaskan men (3.2%). Drinkers who DUI are more likely to be men (regardless of ethnicity), not married, consume more alcohol, and be alcohol dependent than drinkers who do not engage in alcohol-impaired driving. However, important ethnic specific predictors are also identified across the different ethnic groups.

Authored Book",,,"(from the cover) New York's urban neighborhoods are full of young would-be emcees who aspire to ""keep it real"" and restaurants like Sylvia's famous soul food eatery that offer a taste of ""authentic"" black culture. In these and other venues, authenticity is considered the best way to distinguish the real from the phony, the genuine from the fake. But in Real Black, John L. Jackson Jr. proposes a new model for thinking about these issues--racial sincerity. Jackson argues that authenticity caricatures identity as something imposed on people, imprisoning them within stereotypes: an African American high school student who excels in the classroom, for instance, might be dismissed as ""acting white."" On the other hand, sincerity, as Jackson defines it, imagines authenticity as an incomplete measuring stick, an analytical model that attempts to deny people agency in their search for identity. Drawing on more than ten years of ethnographic research in and around New York City, Jackson offers a kaleidoscope of subjects and stories that directly and indirectly address how race is negotiated in today's world--including tales of book-vending numerologists, urban conspiracy theorists, corrupt police officers, mixed-race neo-Nazis, and gospel choirs forbidden to catch the Holy Ghost. Jackson records and retells their interconnected sagas, all the while attempting to reconcile these stories with his own crisis of identity and authority as an anthropologist terrified by fieldwork. Finding ethnographic significance where mere mortals see only bricks and mortar, his invented alter ego Anthroman takes to the streets, showing how race is defined and debated, imposed and confounded every single day.

Edited Book",,,"(from the introduction) This four-volume set, The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination, takes a fresh look at that issue that is embedded in today's global environment. Images, attitudes and perceptions that sustain prejudice and discrimination are more covert, but no less pernicious. What people say, believe, and do all reflect underlying bias. We do not claim here to address every existing form of prejudice or discrimination, nor do we cite every possible group targeted today. What we offer are insights into a range from the most to least recognized, or openly discussed, forms of this injustice. Each chapter offers new perspectives on standing issues, with practical information about how to cope with prejudice and discrimination. The ""toolbox"" at the end of each chapter suggests steps to be taken at different levels to combat prejudice and discrimination and to achieve change. At the individual level, self-reflection needs to occur by both the victims and perpetrators of discrimination. Practitioners, educators, and all who deliver services potentially impart a bias perpetuating prejudice and discrimination. At the systems level, communities and policymakers must join together and have the will to combat discrimination. Volume 1, Racism in America, looks at stereotypes, racial bias, and race relations. Volume 2, Ethnicity and Multiracial Identity, looks at discrimination toward differences due to immigration, language, culture, and mixed race. Volume 3, Bias Based on Gender and Sexual Orientation, looks at gender bias, women's issues, homophobia, and oppression of gay/lesbian lifestyles. Volume 4, Disability, Religion, Physique, and Other Traits, strives to examine less-spotlighted bias against other forms of difference, and begins the difficult dialogue that must take place if we are to eradicate prejudice and discrimination.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This is a lively and sensitive account of a session with a latency-aged boy beginning to engage in a dialogue with his therapist. As such it illustrates what must have been an internal change, a change that allowed Ben to feel safe enough to have moments of talking to the therapist as a nine-year-old boy as opposed to as a superhero. It is helpful to know at the outset that a first sibling is soon due, and to have a sense of the material preceding the session given. The introduction conveys a clear sense of Ben as a boy relying on omnipotent defences to protect him from feeling frightened, helpless, powerless, and perhaps also terrifyingly small in the face of others experienced as mercilessly powerful. The session begins in the waiting room. Ben is hiding. Understandably, the therapist does not want to engage in play in the waiting room, but Ben is disappointed to be found. Soon Ben puts the therapist on the spot in regard to the date of his birthday. At this point in the session, however, Ben withdraws when the therapist explicitly takes up his anxiety about the new baby messing up his birthday. We also learn why we were given the detail that Ben is a boy of mixed race. The baby must have a different father from Ben, as the new sibling will be white.

In the weeks before this session, the therapy time has been filled with much manic activity. Ben has been leaping around the room with great athletic agility from chair to table to sofa while at the same time recounting to me in much detail and with a great deal of animation the exploits of his favourite characters from films such as Spiderman, Dragonball-Z and the James Bond films. Attempts by me to help him feel less anxious and to think about what is behind all this activity have usually been met with verbal abuse or an angry leaving of the room. He has been particularly hostile to any links I have tried to make between his worries and the impending arrival of a first sibling. However, we have been able to establish together that watching television and playing computer games are his 'addiction' (his words), and that he feels that he needs to act like a warrior and be on his mettle most of the time as life can be so frightening.

Vol.65(5-B),2004, pp. 2667.",,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,,"This thesis describes a longitudinal analysis of parent-adolescent relationship quality in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents. Using individual growth modeling and data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort (NLSY97) I explored the developmental course of parent-adolescent relationship quality, guided by these questions: (1) How does parent-adolescent relationship quality change between ages 12 to 18 years? (2) Does the developmental course of parent-adolescent relationship quality vary with respect to adolescent gender and race-ethnicity? (3) Are differences between adolescents in the level and rate of change in parent-adolescent relationship quality related to family processes, such as engagement in family activities and parental monitoring? When modeled only as a function of age, I found parent-adolescent relationship quality declines between ages 12 and 16, leveling off over the next two years for father-adolescent relationships, and improving slightly for mother-adolescent relationships. Across all ages, adolescents viewed their relationships with their mothers in more positive terms than with their fathers, but average assessments of relationship quality was fairly positive for both parents. When controlling for parent education and puberty status, I found the developmental course of mother-adolescent relationship quality did not vary with respect to adolescent gender and race-ethnicity, but father-adolescent relationship quality did. The cumulative effects of gender and race-ethnicity result in Black/Mixed Race daughters reporting the least positive and Latino and White sons reporting the most positive relationships with their fathers. Overall, I found that the level of parent-adolescent relationship quality is positively related to family processes and that this association manifests in complex ways. Parental monitoring moderates the association between parent-adolescent relationship quality and family activities, gender, race-ethnicity, and puberty status. At high levels of monitoring, the positive association between family activities and the negative associations between gender, race-ethnicity, puberty, and level of parent-adolescent relationship quality are less pronounced than at low levels of monitoring. Building on research linking close, supportive parent-adolescent relationships to several positive psychosocial outcomes, these results provide information useful to practitioners interested in strengthening families through education and intervention programs designed to foster the healthy development of supportive relationships between parents and adolescents.

Using Bordin's (1983) Supervisory Working Alliance Theory as a theoretical framework, this study explored the relationship between supervisors' multicultural competencies (awareness, knowledge, skills, and relationships) and the supervisors and supervisees' perceptions of the supervisory working alliance. Three research hypotheses were developed and tested in this study using a sample of 79 mixed race supervision dyads consisting of White supervisors and trainees of color. Results from multiple linear regression analyses indicated that supervisors' multicultural relationships accounted for all of the variance in supervisees' working alliance, but in a negative direction. There was also a significant relationship found between supervisors and supervisees' perceptions of the supervisory working alliance, although a small amount of the variance was explained. The results indicate that mixed race supervision dyads are vulnerable to misperceptions. It is important for supervisors to explore trainees' perceptions in an effort to minimize or resolve misperceptions. Supervisors' multicultural competence in counseling relationships does not seem to generalize to their competence in multicultural supervision relationships, in fact, the opposite appears to be true. Further implications of the results are discussed. Finally, limitations and recommendations for research are explored, emphasizing that the relationship in multicultural supervision may be more important than other multicultural variables for trainees of color.

Vol.64(11-B),2004, pp. 5781.",,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,,"The question of whether and how racial difference has an impact on mixed-race psychotherapy dyads has been discussed in psychoanalytic literature for over fifty years. At first, authors addressed this question primarily using the model of the White clinician and the Black patient. Race was generally equated with racism and the focus was on how oppression had a negative affect on the oppressed person's ability to attain a healthy ego. Current psychoanalytic literature often looks more at how race is handled within the clinician and patient's relationship. Hermeneutic ideas based on the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer promote a form of post-structuralism that seeks to balance objectivism and relativism and explore the quality of dialogue that exists between people. There is a growing body of literature on how race impacts experiences within psychoanalytic psychotherapy, but no studies have used in-depth interviews with either therapists or patients and incorporated a hermeneutic framework. This research gave people with mixed-race therapy experience the opportunity to discuss their thoughts about how race was part of these therapeutic interactions. This study used qualitative, exploratory methods in order to gather as much data about the subjective experiences of each participant. Hermeneutic and psychoanalytic perspectives emphasized the meanings of these experiences within this particular time and place in history and how race is something to be negotiated and explored, not transcended. Eight clinicians and 6 patients were interviewed for this study. The clinicians were of varying race (2 African-American, 2 Asian-American and 4 Caucasian), gender (1 male, 7 female), age (29-38), and worked in different kinds of clinical settings (private practice, agency/school setting) using different theoretical orientations. The patients were of varying race (2 African-American, 1 African-European, 1 Asian-American, 1 Caucasian and 1 Latino), gender (2 male and 4 female), age (25-39) and had been in treatment in different kinds of clinical settings (private practice, hospital or clinic). It is hoped that this research provided valuable preliminary data about experiences within mixed-race psychodynamic psychotherapy dyads, and suggested ideas for future studies that focus on similar topics.

Vol.64(7-B),2004, pp. 3556.",,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,,"The Multiracial-Heritage Awareness and Personal Affiliation (M-HAPA) Theory was proposed to account for mixed race identity. M-HAPA Theory suggests that mixed race identity could be conceptualized by three identity types: Marginal Identity Status, in which the individual does not affiliate with any of the racial groups in their heritage; Singular Identity Status, in which an individual affiliates solely with one racial group in their heritage; and Integrated Identity Status, in which the mixed race individual integrates many racial groups into their identity. A self-report measure (M-HAPAs), based on the M-HAPA Theory, was devised and administered to a diverse group of 364 multiracial individuals. Participants were recruited through three major universities in Hawaii. Psychometric properties of the measure were evaluated; the new instrument demonstrated good internal consistency reliability. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that though both 3- and 4-factor models were interpretable, the extraction of the 4-factor model was indicated. Further examination of the results of the exploratory factor analysis revealed that Integrated Identity Status was composed of two sub-types: the Combinatory Factor, in which the mixed race individual integrates their affiliations with all of the racial groups in their heritage into their identity; and the Universality Factor, in which the individual identifies with the commonalities among all racial groups. Construct validity was evaluated by comparing the participants' responses on the M-HAPAs to measures of ethnic identity, ego identity, self-esteem and social desirability. The findings were, in general, consistent with hypotheses drawn from the preponderance of literature that suggested relationships between these variables. The results of the current study lend support to the validity of the proposed Multiracial-Heritage Awareness and Personal Affiliation Theory.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The author uses the term ""mixed race"" mindfully, aware that the term is contested by some, while others warn against its reference to the unscientific non-sense of ""race"". Therefore, for the purposes of this article only, she defines ""mixed race"" people as the offspring of one white and one non-white parent. Concentrating on the visual, this article intends to use the figure of the mixed ""race"" subject to investigate the particular scopic regime of whiteness. The author considers some of the things that the dominant scopic regime accords visibility to, and some of those it does not. Clearly, what ends up being seen and the various interpretations then afforded depend largely on cultural registers, power relations, and epistemologies that continually shift. This article intends to foreground a tricky kind of whiteness that is notable for its almost complete invisibility--the whiteness of the mixed ""race"" subject. By way of a focus on the ocular, the author suggests that the subject with an identifiably mixed ""race"" phenotype poses some quite specific threats to some of whiteness's most cherished understandings of itself. Potentially, the mixed ""race"" subject put the category of whiteness into question (if not crisis). In order to tease out some of these problems, the author uses examples from a recent body of her own visual art work (Morrison, 2002). Carlton Johnson: My 'Life', centers around the experiences of a late-teenage boy of mixed ""race"" living in an all-white region of Britain in the late 1970s. Through the ""mixed"" media of comic strip, video, ""historical"" reconstruction and diary entries, Carlton attempts to tell his story and negotiate his conflicting feelings about the importance others seem to place on his skin. The author also uses some other examples of visual art that raises questions about mixed ""race"" identity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"In 4 studies, the authors examined the impact of categorization on the recollection of ethnically ambiguous faces. Participants were presented with faces lying at various locations on mixed-race continua (i.e., Caucasian-North African and Caucasian-Asian faces were used as source images in a morphing program). In all studies, the prevalence of exclusive ethnic features in a face distorted participants' recollections of the face toward faces more typical of the category. Specifically, the recollection of 30% North African (or 30% Asian) faces shifted toward Caucasian source faces, whereas the recollection of 70% North African (or 70% Asian) faces shifted toward North African (Asian) source faces. Memory distortions did not emerge for extremely ambiguous (50%) faces and proved larger on mixed-race than same-race continua (Studies 3 and 4). Memory distortions also emerged with high levels of confidence. The authors elaborate on the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

Edited Book",Chapter,Handbook/Manual,"(from the chapter) In this paper, we present evidence that supports the hypothesis that to be socially successful, people must have good self-regulation. Fifteen lines of research, including resistance to influence attempts, self-presentation, regulatory focus and interpersonal inspiration, accommodative responses, resisting the temptation of attractive alternates, self-serving biases in close relationships, conforming to group pressures, mixed race interactions, and stereotyping outgroup members, confirm the hypothesis. This review concludes that social functioning hinges on a host of self-control strategies: when people regulate their emotions, control the contents of their thoughts, override initial impulses, and redirect their behavior, they improve their chances at social inclusion. When people fail at self-regulation, they are likely to be ousted from groups and relationships.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The aim was to investigate ethnic differences in lifetime self-harm and attempted suicide in women prisoners, and to examine relationships between self-harm, suicide and substance use on dependence. Subjects included 301 women in ten prisons from different parts of England. Half of the women in the sample reported at least one act of self-harm in their life and 46% reported making a suicide attempt at some time. Lifetime self-harm was associated with a history of harmful drinking and with being a victim of violence, including physical assault, sexual assault and violence from family and friends. Lifetime suicide attempts were associated with reported violence from family or friends. Current high suicide risk was most common among women on remand. Drug dependence and reported violence from family or friends were both more common amongst white women than black/mixed race women. Self-harm and attempted suicide were generally more common among white women, but black/mixed race women dependent on drugs had the highest proportion of women reporting self-harm. There was tentative support for a three-way association between ethnicity, dependence and self-harm; this raises the possibility that drug dependence may be a predictor of self-harm in the black female prison population.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"White slavery narratives--stories about white women forced into prostitution--played an important role in the construction of racial distinctions in the early twentieth century. New York City politicians launched a well-publicized anti-vice crusade in 1910 that led to the imprisonment of a mixed-race woman named Belle Moore. In this article, I analyse this event to show the importance of sexuality and gender for creating racial boundaries. Testimony in People vs. Belle Moore designated certain intimacies as violating the color line, thereby clarifying what it meant to be 'White' or 'Colored'. I argue that theories of racial formation must include a more careful consideration of gender and sexuality because the ongoing maintenance of racial categories depends upon cultural narratives about sexual deviance and purity.

Data from the Department of Defense 1995 Sexual Harassment Survey were used to conduct logistic regression analyses. The sample for this study consisted of 310 female respondents who indicated experiencing sexual coercion and 248 female respondents who indicated experiencing sexual assault. It was hypothesized that military victims of sexual coercion and assault would be less likely to report to authorities if the perpetrator held higher rank than the victim. It was also hypothesized that military victims of sexual coercion and assault would be more likely to report if they considered the situation to be sexual harassment. Neither of these factors had a statistically significant influence on reporting behavior. The following factors significantly influenced the probability of reporting by sexual coercion victims: race/ethnicity of African American and a situation of sexual coercion lasting from one to six months lowered the probability of reporting; multiple perpetrators of mixed race/ethnicity (some the same as the victim, some different) and the victim feeling ""very"" or ""extremely"" disturbed or threatened by the situation increased the probability of reporting. The following factors significantly influenced the probability of a sexual assault victim reporting: race/ethnicity of African American or Hispanic/other, a situation with one perpetrator compared to situations with multiple perpetrators, and situations lasting one to six months lowered the probability of reporting; being a member of the Army, Navy, or Coast Guard, age in twenties or thirties, and situations in which the victim felt ""very"" or ""extremely"" threatened increased the probability of reporting. Future research that distinguishes between forms of sexual harassment is needed in order to identify and understand barriers to reporting.

In Study 1, participants viewed a brief animated film depicting a group converging on an individual. In Study 2 the film depicted an individual leaving a group. The racial composition of the interactions varied. Results from these two studies suggest that participants believe that whites have a fear and dislike of blacks, that blacks are more individualistic than whites, that multiracials have more fluid racial boundaries for classifying mixed-raced individuals than whites and blacks, and that mixed-race people are better adjusted than whites and blacks think they are. In study 3 respondents viewed a film depicting an individual leaving its partner for a different individual. Results of Study 3 suggest that blacks and multiracials are more capable of dealing with rejection situations than whites, perhaps because whites are not used to attributing negative events to external causes (e.g., racial discrimination). Together, the three studies explored people's culturally shared beliefs concerning racial group membership and race relations.

The history of race mixing in the United States is addressed in Wehrly (1996) and Wehrly, Kenney, and Kenney (1999) and will not be repeated here. After a section on definitions of terms pertinent to the interracial population, this chapter will concentrate on societal and professional issues related to work with the mixed-race population and on counseling strategies to assist mixed-race individuals and families in breaking barriers that may be inhibiting the attainment of their full human potential.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,,"In this provocative book Mary Weismantel explores experiences, practices and social structures of race and sex in the Andes through stories generated around two contradictory characters, cultural icons that thrive on tensions between fantasy and reality. Images of mixed race cholas arouse in white men both desire and disgust for women who difference makes them exciting and whose racial and sexual subordination makes them available. Stories of horrifying white bogeymen called pishtacos frighten poor Indians and women, and evoke their own vulnerability to the predations of the powerful. Weismantel argues that the cultural icons of the sensual brown woman called chola and the aggressively penetrating white man known as pishtaco are not innocent fantasies, for they arouse the violent passions of societies fractured by race and sex, and divided by vast economic inequalities. In a book that is not about gays or lesbians per se, Weismantel helps to queer Andean studies by questioning heteronormative assumptions that often frame discussions of rape, body and identity.

Data are derived from self-reports of race, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), which provides a large representative national sample of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. Respondents could report more than 1 race. Results. Mixed-race adolescents showed higher risk when compared with single-race adolescents on general health questions, school experience, smoking and drinking, and other risk variables. Conclusions. Adolescents who self-identify as more than 1 race are at higher health and behavior risks. The findings are compatible with interpreting the elevated risk of mixed race as associated with stress.

This article provides an overview of CRT and illuminates the dilemmas for white researchers wishing to incorporate CRT into their work. The author argues that while CRT may not be fully open to white researchers, their strategic use of CRT can help legitimize its use in fighting racism in educational settings. Building on her participation in CRT discussions in a mixed-race setting, the author suggests that white researchers must work to center race in their personal lives and work, engage in the strategic and sensitive use of CRT, and join in the effort to legitimize research that utilizes alternative methods such as CRT.

Anonymous questionnaires were administered to 81,247 9th and 12th grade public school students. Variables of interest included smoking frequency, weight concerns, and smoking for weight loss or control. With the exception of black females, female smokers of different racial/ethnic groups were as likely as white girls to smoke for weight loss or control. Compared to white male smokers, American Indian and Asian American male smokers were more likely to smoke for weight loss or control, and black, Hispanic, and mixed race male smokers were equally likely to smoke for weight loss or control. Heavy smokers, smokers who perceived themselves as overweight or were weight-concerned were significantly more likely to report smoking as a weight control method. Smoking for weight control is prevalent across many race/ethinic groups and both genders among adolescents.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"In this article I examine how a so-called ""bush"" college designated under Apartheid for the education of Coloured (mixed-race) students contributed to the radicalization of South Africa's Western Cape region. The creation of the University of the Western Cape (UWC) was part of an Apartheid divide and rule strategy to inhibit the development of political alliances between mixed-race and indigenous African peoples. However, in 1982, UWC rejected the use of Apartheid classifications for selecting entrants, thereby establishing the country's first non-racial, open admissions policy. UWC paid a price for its principled efforts, as the Apartheid regime slashed state subsidies and engaged the institution in a protracted legal and ideological struggle over the right to determine its own educational policies. Viewing UWC's transformation as microcosm of the country's negotiated settlement to end Apartheid, the article concludes with a critical discussion of Coloured identity and the limits of democratic reform in post-Apartheid South Africa.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Estimates of around 1.7-2.4% of the population in the USA, 2% in Canada, and 0.6% in Britain now self-identify as mixed race. Inter-ethnic unions comprise around 2.7% of all unions in the USA and 1.3% in Britain and are increasing. The impact of these changes on the ethnic/racial diversity of Britain and North America and the demand from persons of mixed race to describe their 'full' identity requires a response from government and Census agencies that classify the population by race/ethnicity. Research show that the self-understandings of persons of mixed race may incorporate a range of identities, some biracial and others a single group like 'black', although the options available in the USA may still be limited by the legacy of the hypodescent policy. The solutions offered by classifications in the 2000/2001 round of censuses include a subdivided 'mixed' category in England and Wales and provision to select one or more categories in the USA. This marks an end to the official conceptualisation of 'pure' races that has been so pervasive in the past and, for the first time, offers mixed race identity to those of mixed heritage.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This paper tells the story of 4 sixth-grade students, of mixed race and social class, who worked together in a small group and experimented with colored solutions of different densities. In spite of common interests, they often failed to achieve intersubjective communication about the colored solutions or about the process of planning and making a poster to report their findings. The authors explain this using the concepts of polysemy, privileging, and holding the floor. In particular, Carla (an African American girl) was unable to hold the floor within the group, so her opportunities for science learning were diminished. The four students were not overtly prejudiced in their speech or actions. Yet the expectations they brought with them led them to reconstruct among themselves some of the most troubling inequities of our society as a whole. This story is about important connections. In particular it is about how the actions of children are connected to the histories of their families, and how the privileging of ideas is connected to that of people, and how the practice of science is connected to that of discrimination. Science education reformers may underestimate the difficulty of separating conceptual conflict about ideas from interpersonal conflict about privilege and status.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This paper examines the ways 'mixed race' women in Canada contemplate their relationship to national identity. Through qualitative, open-ended interviews with 24 women identified as 'mixed race' (aged 20-55 yrs), the research demonstrates how some women of 'mixed race' contest ideas of the nation as constituted through the policy of multiculturalism in Canada. To challenge the tropes of the national narrative, some women of 'mixed race' develop nuanced models of cultural citizenship, illustrating that national identities are formed and transformed in relation to representation. Refusing to be positioned outside the nation, they effectively produce their own meanings of identity by working through their own personally identified 'mixed race' bodies to the national body politic, where some of them see their own bodies as intrinsically 'multicultural'. The paper ends by addressing the paradoxes of multiculturalism, emphasising through narratives that the policy produces hierarchical spaces against which some 'mixed race' women imaginatively negotiate, contest and challenge perceptions of their racialised and gendered selves.

Mixed African-Americans described greater consistency in ascribed racial identity and a consistency between ascribed racial identity and racial identification to others.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Examined whether facial averageness and symmetry are attractive in non-Western cultures. Increasing the averageness of individual faces, by warping those faces towards an averaged composite of the same race and sex, increased the attractiveness of both Chinese (Exp 1) and Japanese (Exp 2) faces, for Chinese and Japanese participants, respectively. Decreasing averageness by moving the faces away from an average shape decreased attractiveness. The authors also manipulated the symmetry of Japanese faces by blending each original face with its mirror image to create perfectly symmetric versions. Japanese raters preferred the perfectly symmetric versions to the original faces (Exp 2). These findings show that preferences for facial averageness and symmetry are not restricted to Western cultures, consistent with the view that they are biologically based. Interestingly, it made little difference whether averageness was manipulated by using own-race or other-race averaged composites and there was no preference for own-race averaged composites over other-race or mixed-race composites (Exp 1). We discuss the implications of these results for understanding what makes average faces attractive.

These educational centers included special schools for physically disabled children with normal or borderline IQs, training centers for children with IQ 30-50, and special care centers for profoundly retarded children. The results show that 75% of Black, 40% of mixed race, and 10% of White children had no regular contact with a doctor through their special educational centers. Staff at the centers identified this as a major encumbrance; many times their advice was not followed or no response was received from the referral center. It is concluded that without a coordinated comprehensive system of review for disabled children, it is likely that many problems, including behavioral and psychiatric disorders, are not being adequately dealt with.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"This study provides a demographic portrait of multiracial households, using children as the units of analysis. The authors conceptualize three dimensions for understanding multiracialness: (1) the racial composition of a household overall, (2) where in the household a racial difference exists relative to the household head, and (3) where in the household a racial difference exists relative to each child. Using microdata from the 1980 U.S. census, the authors explore the first two of these dimensions and test two propositions about the links between racial diversity and other nonracial attributes of children's household environments. The finding is made, among other things, that the largest proportion of children live in Asian-white households, and that about 60% live in households headed by mixed-race couples. Support for the notion that attributes of multiracial households fall between those of their same-race counterparts was mixed. Nonetheless, there appears to be a link between location of diversity and some nonracial characteristics of the household.

Faces were either transformed or untransformed in pose between initial study and recognition test. No significant effects on cross-race eyewitness identification were found for either race or either S or target, nor were there any full cross-over interactions. Europeans found transformed faces generally more difficult to identify than Africans. Both races performed well on nontransformed cross-racial faces, but Europeans were significantly poorer on transformed Black faces, indicating an ""other-race"" effect.

Reciprocal projective identification between internal and external white part-objects and internal and external black part-objects locates desirable aspects of the self in white objects and undesirable aspects in black objects.

Social movement scholars have called for more attention to dynamics of gender and race in social movement organizations, especially to the challenges of maintaining internal solidarity. Based on field observations in a pro-feminist, progressive, mixed-gender, mixed-race social movement organization, this article examines organizational decision-making processes and interpersonal and group dynamics. From February 1990 to May 1992, the author attended meetings; conducted 40 in-depth interviews with board members, staff and donors; and innumerable informal conversations; and reviewed documents back to 1974. The data was reviewed for themes and patterns. Gendered and racialized patterns of subordination are both very much in evidence and, at the same time, actively challenged in this organization. The author argues that pro-feminist and progressive organizational practices and efforts to create solidarity across gender and race can exist through competing and contradictory dynamics and ongoing struggles. Complex and inconsistent dynamics around these social barriers are likely to occur in organizations more generally and need to be a subject for more research.

When the instrument was factor analyzed, the structure of the five-factor model was well reproduced for the entire sample as well as the White and Black subgroups. Parallel analysis indicated the appropriateness of the five-factor solution. Whereas the structure of personality was highly similar across race, there were statistically significant differences in mean scores of some domains and facets by race. The greatest difference was in Openness to Experience, particularly in the Openness to Feelings facet, with the White subgroup scoring relatively high, the Black subgroup scoring relatively low, and the Indian subgroup scoring in an intermediate range. The authors speculate that these differences are primarily the result of social, economic, and cultural differences between the races rather than the direct product of race itself.

Edited Book",Chapter,Handbook/Manual,"(from the chapter) I never wanted to be White growing up. It is a good thing because I was not. But now, I am almost White in some people's eyes. How this happened tells not only a piece of some of my life story but, in hindsight, has allowed some of my critical thinking around racial and ethnic identity formation. My transformation of color has not been my own doing but a reflection of a larger racial project in this country. Reflections on my racial transformation, raised by one parent not familiar with the racial system of the United States and the other having internalized the system so well, figured critically into how I have been able to think about identity formation. I had to for survival's sake--both in the world and to make sense out of the subtleties of human interaction. When I came to the United States with my mother as a small child, we were not White. My mother is a Filipina, not Filipina American, as she always reminds me even after 40-plus years. Whereas my father is a White American, he sustained some subtle and not so subtle demotions in status as a result of marrying a non-White person. In this chapter I share some of my personal and professional experiences as a mixed-race person.

District Six in Cape Town is used as an example for an apartheid interpretation and environmental mediation program. This district may be the best known example of the destruction of a mixed race community through Group Areas legislation in South Africa.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the chapter) This final chapter discusses psychotherapy in light of oppression due to gender, race and class. It reads in part: The important point for me as a psychotherapist is that this racist history has influenced how I see myself, the interest I take in my work, and what kind of work I do. It is no accident that most of my professional life has been spent working with mixed-race groups, exploring issues to do with black/white identity, and working with oppressed groups, because that is part of me. In contrast I must admit that another part of me was white supremacist-I was putting down black people and Asians as all Anglo Indians did, because they did not want to identify with the oppressed Asians. But although growing up in that kind of a family has taught me a lot, gut feeling just hasn't been enough. I have also had to look at how I could make use of existing theories and methods and work that has been done in the past. I am not going to be an apologist for psychotherapy. I would actually be harder than most on European, white psychotherapy because I have seen its tremendous failings and it has not given me enough-although I am a clinical psychologist with psychotherapy training-because its practice and its professional institutions are both severely limited and dominated by white Eurocentric thought.

Black girls had significantly higher mean body mass index (BMI) values than either White or mixed race girls. Controlling for differences in BMI, White girls scored significantly higher on the BSQ than did mixed race or Black girls, whereas no ethnic differences were found for EAT scores. A comparable percentage of Black, mixed race and White girls had scores indicative of eating disorder pathology on the EAT, while a higher percentage of White, compared to mixed race and Black, girls had abnormal scores on the BSQ. The ideal body size desired by White girls was significantly smaller than that of the mixed race or Black samples. Dissatisfaction with present body size was significantly higher in White, compared to Black or mixed race girls.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"The aim of this study was to contribute to knowledge of the construct validity of the Griffiths Scales of Mental Development (Griffiths Scales) through an examination of the underlying dimensions tapped by the six subscales, using Common Factor Analysis. A sample of 430 South African children (aged 54-83 mo), from four ethnic groups (i.e. White, Mixed Race, Asian and Black) participated. The correlation coefficients obtained for the South African groups were compared to those Griffiths obtained in her work with the British standardization sample of the Griffiths Scales. The pattern of correlation for South African and British subjects was found to be similar. This suggests that the Scales are measuring a construct which is consistent across cultures and through time. A factor analysis was performed with the data for each South African ethnic group separately and the factor solutions were compared to determine whether the Griffiths Scales measure similar or different constructs for the groups. The results indicate that the Griffiths Scales tend to measure one factor, and including only common variables, the factor appears to be similar cross-culturally.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Using a life course perspective, this paper traces cigarette use over ages 13-17 yrs among a mixed-race sample of economically disadvantaged urban students. Compared to African American teens, cigarette use by white teens was much more prevalent. Still, experimentation with cigarettes (aged 13-14 yrs) was a powerful predictor of cigarette use at ages 15 and 17 for youth of both races, with those who were least engaged in school more likely to experiment at early ages. Employment during the school year predicted more use of cigarettes mainly by white males, with cigarette use by white females not related to employment. The number of African Americans in this sample who used cigarettes was so few that to analyze cigarette use in relation to employment is not possible. White male students were more disengaged from school, and more likely to be performing adult-type work than other students. This paper suggests they use cigarettes as a means to signal their acceleration of the adult transition.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted among 2612 randomly selected Ss (aged 15-25) from 13 cities in venues identified with large samples of ethnic minority YMSM. The 13 sites were divided into 4 ethnic strata, within which only YMSM of 1 of the following ethnic backgrounds were recruited: African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and mixed ethnicity. Results show that 22% of Ss reported that their last sexual contact with their main sexual partner, someone other than a main sexual partner, or both involved unprotected anal intercourse. Ss from Asian/Pacific Islander sites, mixed sites, and Hispanic sites were more likely than Ss from African American sites to report unprotected anal intercourse. Within the mixed sites, Hispanic Ss, followed by Asian/Pacific Islander and White Ss, were more likely than African American Ss to report unprotected anal intercourse. It is concluded that interventions are needed that are responsive to the racial/ethnic differences in HIV risk behaviors of YMSM throughout urban American cities.

Girls reported lower self-perceptions than boys on the dimensions of Athletic Competence and Physical Appearance, but higher self-perceptions for Behavioral Conduct. No gender differences were found for Global Self-Esteem or perceptions of Scholastic Competence or Social Acceptance. Black children had higher perceptions of Physical Appearance than White children but reported similar scores on the other five dimensions. No interaction effects for gender and race were identified for any of the dimensions of self-perception. Peer acceptance was positively correlated with perceived Social Acceptance and Global Self-Esteem. There were no significant main effects of gender or race for any of the correlations between peer acceptance and dimensions of self-perception. A significant interaction effect was identified for the relationship between peer acceptance and perceptions of Physical Appearance: the relationship between peer acceptance and perceived physical appearance was significantly stronger for Black boys than for each of the other three groups. The evaluation of the Self-Perception Profile for Children indicated that its psychometric properties are acceptable for Black and White children of both genders. These results suggest that for children in America, gender and race do not generally have a significant clinical impact on specific dimensions of self-perception or on the relationships between self-perceptions and peer acceptance. In addition, the gender effects found here for a mixed-race group are generally in agreement with prior research, which was conducted using mostly White samples. This finding suggests that self-perceptions and the relationships between self-perceptions and peer acceptance are not race-specific. Although some gender and race differences were statistically significant, the effect sizes were small in all cases. Therefore, the few identified differences should be kept in perspective, and attention should be focused on the overwhelming similarities among these groups of children. This project was supported by a 12-month Dissertation Research Grant in Child and Adolescent Developmental Psychopathology from the National Institute of Mental Health.

Attitudes toward battered wives, as related to the race of the victim and the racial mix of the couple, were examined in the present study. It was predicted that participants (a) would view the black victim differently than the white victim, and (b) would view the victim in an interracial couple differently than the victim in a same race couple. In addition, it was predicted that (c) participants who had been victims of domestic violence would have more positive attitudes toward the victim, and (d) participants would have more negative attitudes toward victims of their own race. Two hundred and ninety-four participants read domestic violence scenarios and viewed obscured photographs in which the race of the victim and the racial mix of the couple were varied. After reading the scenario, each participant completed the Adjective Check List describing traits of the victim. Participants also completed the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale to provide information regarding domestic violence experience. The majority of participants had never been victims or perpetrators of domestic violence at any point in their lives. There were significant associations between lifetime and current domestic violence experience and participant race and education. The data failed to provide support for the hypotheses. Men saw victims significantly more negatively than women, and participants saw victims of their own race less negatively than victims of the other race. Results are discussed in relationship to previous studies examining attitudes toward victims, experience with domestic violence, and racial issues. Implications and recommendations for future research are presented.

The sample consisted of 769 children (aged 15 yrs or under) offered outpatient appointments. Ethnic background influenced referrer type. Over-referrals against expectations were: White children more by GPs than expected, Black and South Asian children by specialist doctors, Black children by education services and Mixed Race children by social services. There was neither a significant difference in ethnic background between attendees and non-attendees nor were gender, age or problem types related to ethnic group. Clinicians should be aware that referral routes may appropriately, or inappropriately, be different for different ethnic groups. Differences found may be due to genuine variations in morbidity, thus leading to presentation to different referrers.

Younger children from divorced homes experienced a lower quality of mother-child relationship than older children. The quality of relationships are lower for studies conducted more recently when compared with those conducted in earlier decades. Larger samples and studies utilizing attitude measures yielded stronger evidence for a lower quality of interpersonal relationship.

Topics discussed include the concept of identity, choice of ethnic identity, identity and social interaction, self-identification. A study surveying 72 high school students (mean age 15 yrs) to investigate how biracial children develop their racial identification and the communication that affects that process. The results indicate that from 3 courses of assimilation, the majority of the participants ascribe to the cultural pluralism model.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Examined the conversational styles employed by students attending a desegregated middle school while discussing race. Students discussed issues related to race in focus groups initially comprised solely of White, Black, or nondominant individuals. Subsequently, subjects (Ss) then convened in mixed-race groups, with conversation styles examined. Results show that Ss employed 2 distinct types of conversational styles. In the 1st type, which may be labeled ""bridging talk"", Ss used multiple strategies to build unity across differences. In the 2nd type, ""conflict talk,"" Ss discursively created borders and conflict. Findings suggest promises and challenges for each type of discussion. A 3rd form for consideration, ""democratic conversation,"" would invite perspectives while acknowledging the privileging and silencing that accompany them. It is concluded that educators should hold conversations that explicitly address the power dynamics inherent in such conversations and teach the conceptual tools and language to identify these dynamics. Although these conversations across racial lines are sometimes threatening and difficult, they are a critical component of democratic education.

The social effects of violence on our adolescents have profound implications on their development, now and as they mature into adulthood. The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of exposure to violence in an inner city community on aspects of adolescent identity development during this critical phase. The collection of data was pursued to answer specific questions: (a) what are adolescents' experiences with exposure to violence in their community as revealed in their self narratives, (b) what interpretations and meanings do adolescents ascribe to their exposure to violence in the community, (c) how does exposure to violence affect adolescents' self image, view of a just and benevolent world, value of human life, ideology of right and wrong, and thoughts of their future? The conceptual orientation for this study was psychobiography, or life history. Personal narratives are significant resources for understanding individual persons. The ascribed meanings for life experiences influence how persons organize their self identity. The methodology for this study was a qualitative exploratory design that used a non-probability sample. Young adults between the ages of 18 and 21 were recruited from inner city community programs. Data were collected from a demographic sheet and written transcripts of audio-taped stories. The chronological arrangement of events of exposure on an Age Line helped participants organize their stories. Data were analyzed according to the methodologies of narrative and constant comparative analysis. Thirteen participants, 11 Blacks, 1 Hispanic, 1 Mixed race, completed the study by telling their personal stories describing their exposure to community violence. The numbers of exposures to community violence ranged from 2 to 6 per person. The young persons in this study used coping strategies of distrust, detachment, distraction, and minimization. A major theme was one of oppression. Further research is needed to expand the knowledge of the impact of violence on adolescent identity development.

Authored Book",,,"(from the publicity materials) Investigates how mixed race people cope in a world that has shoehorned them into a racial category that denies half of their physiological and psychological existence. The author presents relevant demographic, research, and sociocultural data as well as a series of personal vignettes based on interviews with 119 American-born black/white interracial young adults (mean age of 21.4 yrs) from all walks of life. The author interweaves research findings with these interviews in order to highlight certain psychosocial phenomenon and experiences. The history of interracial marriages in the US is examined, and the scientific and social theories that underlie the racial bigotry suffered by mixed people are discussed. Questions of racial identity, conflict, and self-esteem are addressed and treated as issues of mental health, and the struggle for acceptance in a black and white world and the racist abuses that many interracial people have suffered are discussed as well.

Ss completed the 1998 Minnesota Student Survey, a 121-item, questionnaire that inquires about multiple health-related content domains, including gambling behavior. The majority of students had gambled at least once during the past year, however, most students did not report gambling frequently, nor did they report problems associated with their gambling. Boys reported gambling more often than girls, and older students gambled more often than younger students. A larger percentage of Mexican/Latin American, African American, American Indian, and mixed race students gambled at weekly and daily rates than Asian American and Caucasian students. Variables associated with gambling frequency included antisocial behavior, gender (being a male), alcohol and tobacco use, age, feeling bad about the amount of money they bet, a desire to stop gambling, and increased sexual activity. Gambling appears to be related to other risk-taking behaviors and may be a part of the adolescent experimentation with adult behaviors.

However, as a group, they have not been well studied. Previous research has tended to focus on identity in children, adolescents and young adults. This dissertation is based on a study of a sector of the mixed race population that has been less visible; those who were middle aged and elderly at the time the research was done in the late 1990's. The primary method of data collection was through focused life histories of 20 people of mixed race whose ages ranged from 45 to 94. The participants were either of African American/White or Asian American/White background. The study examines factors influencing identity and identification, and how the meaning of being of mixed race is influenced by aging, different historical circumstances, and the race of the non-white parent. A synthesis of elements of racial formation, cultural studies, symbolic interactionist, and life course theories provided the theoretical framework for interpreting the findings of the study. Racial identity did not emerge as a singular, distinct entity in this study. The meaning of being of mixed race is influenced by other aspects of social location such as age, gender, class and nation. Using grounded theory techniques, five dimensions of racial identity emerged: cultural identity, ascribed racial identity, racial identification to others, racial self-identification, and situational racialization of feeling. The age cohort of the participant (older or younger than 65) and the race of the nonwhite parent (Black or Asian American) were associated with different patterns of identity dimensions. These patterns are attributed to the influence of historical circumstances on identity. The dissertation provides an overview of significant events in African American and Asian American history and how they intersect with critical points in the life courses of the two age cohorts. This work demonstrates that racial identity for mixed race people cannot be understood outside of social and historical context.

Data consisted of individual interviews with twenty-four participants aged 18-23 (eight per institution), their written responses to two prompts, a focus group at each institution, and observations of campus climate. The research questions were: (1) What factors in the college environment are most salient to multiracial students in their racial identity development? (2) How do multiracial college students understand their racial identity options in college? There were two main findings in this study: how various factors outside and inside the college environment impacted students' identity development and how the campus environment mediated the options available for students to identify racially. Five patterns of racial self-identification among the students emerged. Multiracial students' experience was shaped by their ability to fit into existing groups within the community of students of color, to create a separate group of mixed race students, or both. The three main factors influencing students' ability to fit in were the size and location of the community of students of color in relation to the general campus milieu and the forces of peer culture that facilitated or inhibited movement among and between the public spaces students constructed on campus. This study links the fields of college student development theory and emerging theories about multiraciality through the introduction of an ecology model for understanding multiracial identity development in college students. This study also raises concerns about the use of racial categories in higher education and in the United States as a whole. Finally, this study suggests a number of areas for further research in college student development, multiracial identity development, and race-based policy in higher education.

The author has been involved in the treatment of 9 black female South Africans with eating disorders and notes the absence of any unique features designating the sufferers as black. These observations suggest that, within the urban setting, there is a homogenization of eating-related psychopathology across racial groups. In a sample of 213 adolescent female South African private school students, the author found that 20.7% of white Ss and 37.5% of black Ss were classified as having abnormal eating attitudes based on their responses to the Eating Attitudes Test. 18.6% of black and white adolescent government school students (N = 1,353) also showed abnormal eating attitudes. The author suggests that it is clear that, within the broader South African community, eating attitudes exist that place a significant proportion of adolescents and young adults of all racial groups at risk for the development of eating disorders.

To be specific, this study assesses the effects of proportional representation on the behavior of 90 Asian group members who were assigned to one of three types of groups: all-Asian groups, Asian-Caucasian balanced groups, and Caucasian-dominated groups. Groups were assigned the task of discussing and generating a solution for a managerial case scenario. The discussions were videotaped and viewed by independent judges who evaluated patterns of intragroup behavior including levels of participation and leadership behavior among group members. The findings suggest that proportional representation can act as a significant source of influence on behavior of group members. We conclude this article with a discussion of the implications of these findings from both a practical and theoretical perspective.

Pregnant at 16 she dropped out of school, went on welfare, entered a therapy support group for abuse victims, and is currently attempting to finish high school. She volunteered to take a battery of tests for the author and took the Draw-A-Person Questionnaire (S. A. Karp, 1990, 1999), Karp Objective Word Association Test (Karp, 1996) and the Apperceptive Personality Test: Brief Adult (Karp et al, 1993). Findings are compared and contrasted across tests.

The date used are drawn from a larger study that examines the racial and gendered identity constructions of 27 mixed-race women living in the US. The women in this study reject dominant patterns of stigma by reassigning stigma to their European ancestry. Given this reversal, women articulate and embrace non-white identities.

It introduces 5 new case studies to supplement the 5 presented in the earlier edition and includes a chapter on family therapy that adds insights into counseling and/or therapy for mixed-race couples. A new chapter has also been added on how the multicultural model can be useful in meeting guidelines introduced through managed care. The principal objectives of the model are to help people who feel different and alienated accept and understand their uniqueness. The model also seeks to enhance cultural values and to develop flexibility in cognitive styles. Although its primary focus is on ethnic/racial minorities, the model is appropriate for members of any group that differs from the societal ideal. The ultimate goal of this model is the development of a multicultural orientation to life. The techniques and strategies reflect an eclecticism, ranging from the intensive study of the client's life history and the use of insight, to the employment of cognitive behavioral as well as humanistic and cross-cultural approaches. Multicultural therapy, however, is unique in its theoretical concepts and goals for change.

While both same- and mixed-gender interaction was more likely to be mixed- rather than same-race, mixed-gender interaction was much more likely to include more than one race than all girls' or all boys' interactions.

This research expands on previous studies by combining the aforementioned variables, which have previously been analyzed only separately in the literature, and relating them to parenting attitudes. This study also examines whether a new construct proposed by this author--""cooperative parenting"" (or instrumental, emotional, and financial support)--is related to ethnic group and stress levels for adolescent mothers. It was predicted that there would be a significant positive relationship between socioeconomic status, maturity, knowledge of child development, and authoritative parenting, as well as a significant negative relationship between these variables and authoritarian parenting. Further, a significant negative relationship was predicted between stress, authoritative parenting, and cooperative parenting. It was also predicted that Latina adolescent mothers would use cooperative parenting more than Caucasian adolescent mothers. Participants came from low socioeconomic backgrounds and lived in rural communities in northern California. They were recruited through two statewide intervention programs run by the Department of Social Services and Department of Public Health. A total of 81 mothers participated in the study. The participation rate was 34%. The sample included 30 Latina; 28 Caucasian; 5 African-American; and 18 ""Other"" (Asian, Native American, or mixed race) adolescent mothers. A principal components analysis was undertaken on scores on the predictor variables (stress, knowledge of child development, maturity, ethnic group, and socioeconomic status), in order to create composite scores. Two factors, mother's ""Well Functioning"", (yielding high maturity and low stress) and mother's ""Knowledge of Child Development"" emerged from this analysis. These two factors were then regressed on the criterion (authoritarian parenting). Findings suggested that high stress, together with low maturity and low knowledge of child development, was related to more authoritarian parenting. There was no significant relationship between authoritarian parenting and socioeconomic status for this sample. The hypothesis that cooperative parenting and stress would be inversely related was partly supported. Of the three domains of cooperative parenting, financial support was associated with higher stress for this sample. Conversely, more instrumental support was related to lower stress, whereas emotional support did not appear to significantly relate to stress levels for this sample. Independent t-tests between groups revealed that Latina mothers were characterized by more instrumental and emotional support relative to their Caucasian peers. General limitations of the study were reviewed and clinical implications of the results discussed.

The subject of the re/search is the authors ""self"" through her dual roots and shifting cultural locations of identities in multiple contexts. The deeply felt re/search question throughout the paper is: How do we negotiate the enduring and changing, universal and local, common and different, cultural and spiritual dimensions of our existence, which interface, sometimes colliding, in us as individuals and in our social systems? The author examines how the approaches toward human differences in the United States have been influenced by the epistemologies of the Western philosophical traditions, which tend to privilege rationality and individual ego. She proposes a way of approaching our differences through embodied epistemologies, increased self-and-other awareness, and appreciation of our web-like interconnections. The first chapter, Journeys and Landscapes, deals with the beginning of the purposeful search for self. Her journeys are characterized by a longing for the elusive home and the many hindrances that make the journey home treacherous. The second chapter, Birthing, explores the cultural, historical, and psychological context of her birth on her Japanese mother's side. Delivering, the third chapter, documents how finding and meeting for the first time in her life her European American birth-father jarred the construction and the development of her sense of self and identities. The final chapters, Essays, are the author's attempts to make meaning by theorizing and integrating her life experiences with extensive reading in feminist writing, postmodern thought, cultural studies, cross-cultural and transpersonal psychology. The writing is intensely personal and autobiographical, yet the author's commitment to honesty, self-reflection, and scholarship also make the work politically and socially transformative.

Edited Book",Chapter,,"(from the introduction) This chapter examines how prejudice is communicated in the media. The author focuses his discussion on representations of race and seeks an analytic frame that avoids recreating the system it attempts to critique. He seeks to articulate a lens for explicating media that neither embraces racialization and racial divisions nor accepts a priori racial definitions that maintain existing hierarchies. After reviewing the predominant trends in research on media representations of race (good-bad representations, discrimination, pedagogy about race, audience reception, images and stereotypes, and uses and gratifications), he describes recent trends that examine Whiteness, diaspora, exhilic experiences, and ""otherness."" From these trends, he builds his discussion based on the assumption that media representations are sites of political contestation involving disparities of power. He is concerned about how media images participate in the construction of political realities in addition to reflecting social practice. He uses a text, Doubles, which problematizes binary, essentializing racial purity by focusing on bi- and mixed-race people to challenge images of racial purity and unpack the practice of substituting ""American"" for ""White.""

The SS-B was administered to a low SES, mixed-race (19% Anglo, 37% African American, and 40% Hispanic) sample of 105 adolescents who were attending pregnancy prevention programs.

While one of the chapters focuses on religious and spiritual issues regarding same-sex marriage, most of the focus is on civil marriage because of the benefits bestowed on it by local, state, and federal governments. The book also examines the political and legal issues involved in seeking same-sex marriage. Various chapters explore how and why gay people form relationships, how gay relationships differ from ""straight"" relationships, and what the impact may be with legally sanctioned same-sex marriage on a variety of emotional, psychological, legal, and child rearing issues.
(from the jacket) The contributors probe the harmful psychological effects that denying marital status has on same-sex couples, as well as on society as a whole. They also argue that same-sex marriage is not a moral issue, but a civil rights issue involving equal treatment and non-discrimination.

American Mixed Race: The Culture of Microdiversity (see record 1995-97907-000), edited by Naomi Zack, probes this problem of the color line from the perspective of racial diversity within individuals. The book argues that discussions of diversity (i.e., racial difference, multiculturalism) tend to focus on rigidly defined racial categories that impose group membership for individuals who differ from others in those groups and who may not belong to, or identify with, any particular group. The important contributions of American Mixed Race are twofold. First, the book is multidisciplinary. Contributors represent a number of specialties within the social sciences and humanities. The five sections of the book are autobiography, art, social science, public policy, and identity theory. Second, the book demonstrates the breadth of the microdiversity concept. Although racial distinctions will remain salient within the broader social culture well into the 21st century, the real challenge is recognizing and appreciating the commonalities within human experiences.

Data collection included (1) a semi-structured interview to determine subjects' own sense of racial/ethnic identity, (2) a measure of parental closeness, and (3) a series of twelve anecdotal hypothetical situations as a stimulus to revealing subjects' affective, cognitive and behavioral responses in contexts in which the subjects mixed-heritage might be expected to evoke conflict. A qualitative analysis, incorporating socio-cultural, psychodynamic, and historical perspectives, was utilized to investigate (1) racial and cultural stereotyping, (2) a hierarchy of color and racial categorization, (3) racial tolerance, (4) Black and Jewish relations, (5) biracial (Black and Jewish) identity, as mediated by parental and familial closeness. Factors that influenced racial/identity development in the subjects' lives were identified. Five of the six hypotheses were supported: (1) Phenotype is related to interpersonal perception. The biracial adult phenotypically perceived as African-American is more likely to identify as such, whereas the biracial adult phenotypically perceived as White is more likely to identify as either White or ""mixed."" (2) Closeness to the African-American parent is not necessary for children of mixed-race/Jewish heritage to identity with African-American heritage. (3) Closeness to the Jewish parent is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for children of mixed-race/Jewish heritage to identity with Jewish heritage. (4) For those who are close to their Jewish parent, the degree of closeness affects the degree to which they identify as Jews. (5) The extent to which respondents experience themselves as integral parts of their extended families will increase the extent to which they identify with that half of their cultural heritage. The sixth hypothesis, which stated that to the degree that respondents express negative stereotypes of one part of their heritage they will also minimize their identification with that part of their heritage was not supported due chiefly to the lack of negative stereotyping by most of the respondents.

Specifically, this study focused on the effects that different styles of conflict management have on discrimination between two individuals experiencing a mixed-race dispute. One-hundred-twenty male subjects were paired with a same- or different-race confederate who displayed an avoidant, contentious, or cooperative conflict management style. It was hypothesized that subjects would perceive group boundaries, report negative stereotypes, prejudice attitudes, ingroup bias, negative internal attributions, and perceived dissimilarity, and demonstrate negative nonverbal affect and arousal during conflicts with a different-race partner using a contentious conflict style. These same responses, at a lesser intensity, were expected to be invoked by avoidant conflict styles and minimized by cooperative conflict ones. Results indicated that subjects exhibit the discrimination responses significantly more frequently when interacting with a different-race than same-race confederate displaying a contentious or avoidant conflict style. Conversely, cooperative conflict management minimized the discrimination responses. The findings of this investigation have strong implications for research conducted in both areas of interpersonal conflict and intergroup relations, as well as consequences for real-world, mixed-race disputes.

Eighty fourth- through seventh-grade children, from three elementary and one middle school, participated in the study. A structured interview procedure, the Interpersonal Negotiation Strategies Interview, was used to assess children's social-cognition. The Social Self-Regulation questionnaire, used to assess motivation, was a self-report measure of the extent to which children perceived their social behaviors as autonomous. To measure social competence, the participants in the study were rated by their classroom teacher on the Interpersonal Negotiation Strategies Rating Scale. Children's sociometric status and discipline referrals were also used as measures of social competence. Contrary to the hypotheses, social cognition did not predict ratings on social competence measures. However, there were differences in children's interpersonal styles that predicted teachers' ratings of their social competence. Children with self-transforming or assertive interpersonal styles were more likely to be rated favorably by their teachers than were children with other-transforming or submissive and collaborative interpersonal styles. The impact of motivation on social competence measures was significant. In the sample of African-American, White, Latino, and Mixed-Race children, externally motivated boys were less likely to be selected as popular. African-American males, who were more intrinsically motivated than either Other-Race males and females, were more likely to be rated unfavorably by their teachers. They were also the only children to receive discipline referrals. Yet, within this group of African-American males, the older intrinsically motivated boys received fewer discipline referrals than their younger intrinsically motivated counterparts. There was a significant relationship between social cognition and motivation: Intrinsic motivational orientation was asso (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).","social cognition & motivation, social competence & behavior, African-American & Latino & White & Mixed-Race 4th-7th graders","*Motivation

SES was low. Group allocation was based on a specially devised Language Preference Questionnaire (LPQ) examining different contexts of language use (e.g., during numerical analysis). Standardized tests of non-verbal intelligence, vocabulary, basic reading, reading comprehension and the LPQ were given. Results indicate that controlling for non-verbal intelligence, there was a marked difference in receptive oral vocabulary and a weaker difference in reading ability between the 2 groups. The LPQ show that bilingual children who reported thinking in their parental language had poorer English vocabulary development than bilingual children who preferred to think in English. These findings are discussed in terms of either an effect of frequency of exposure to language or in terms of differences in phonological development between the 2 groups.

Is there a ""color line"" in psychotherapy? Certainly there are stereotypes developed and preserved by psychological theorists and therapists that serve as expressions of established expectations and assumptions. These have, it is argued in this book (see record 1994-98466-000), prevented adequate treatment and service delivery to women who do not fit their image of a model client. The color line, a term drawn from recent U.S. history, was an actual demarcation drawn down hallways and waiting rooms to keep ""colored people"" (as Blacks and others were designated) separate from Whites as part of enforced segregation. This compendium of conceptual analyses, case examples, and suggestions for therapy invites those who would address the therapeutic needs of women to consider change. The goal of this book, which is well conceived and carefully organized, is to alert therapists to the changing realities of the U.S. demographics and prepare them to deliver services to an increasingly diverse population. This book makes a respectable effort at covering the topics of importance for women of the major ethnic groups now in the United States. As it stands, they include chapters on at least six ethnic groups (African Americans, American Indians, Asians, Latinas, women from the Caribbean, and women from India) and five special populations (professionals, lesbians, women of mixed race, refugees, and women who are battered). If there is any major omission, it is the surprising lack of any detailed discussion of the therapist-client relationship.

Jamaican families are unique in that they are frequently ""transnational;"" mothers often migrate several years before their children can join them, so that the family physically extends across national boundaries. Participants were 99 mothers (or other female caregivers) from Jamaica, ranging in age from 25 to 62 years, and their children (N = 120; 60 girls and 60 boys), aged 7 to 12. All were Black or of mixed race. Three groups of children were studied (N = 40 each): Group 1 (born in the U.S.); Group 2 (migrated with mothers); and Group 3 (migrated with separation from mothers). Mothers differed significantly in level of education, with Group 1 mothers more highly educated, while children differed significantly in current age, age at migration, and length of time in the United States. Child problems were measured by the Jamaican Youth Checklist (Lambert, Knight, Taylor & Newell, 1993), a modification of the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1978). Child self-esteem was measured by the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (Coopersmith, 1981), verbal intelligence by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised (Dunn & Dunn, 1981) and life stress by the Life Events Scale - Children (Coddington, 1972). Mothers' psychological adjustment was measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1975). Both used the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales-II to describe family functioning (Olson, Portner, & Lavee, 1985). In comparison with U.S. and Jamaican norms, the children studied had significantly higher levels of internalizing problems. For externalizing problems, these children scored higher than did children in Jamaica, but significantly lower than U.S. children. However, there were no significant differences among the three groups in this study on any outcome measures, such as stress level, self-esteem, verbal fluency, or child problems.

This study investigated the effect of prenatal cocaine exposure on vocal, visual, tactile and mutual gaze interactions of neonates (ages 2-28 days) and their mothers. Two groups (exposed versus non exposed) of 30 infant-mother dyads were used. Prior to data analysis, the groups were examined for demographic differences. The neonates and their mothers were videotaped in their homes by the principal investigator. The Neonatal Perception Inventory (NPI) was completed by the mothers to examine this aspect of the two groups. Findings and conclusions. A convenience sample consisted of 17 female and 13 male neonates in the cocaine exposed group with a mean age of 20.5 days, and 12 females and 18 males in the non cocaine exposed group with a mean age of 18.5 days. There was a higher incidence of caucasians in the cocaine group mothers (70%), compared to 23% African American and 7% of mixed race. The non cocaine group, consisted of 40% of caucasian, 33% of African American and 27% of mixed race. The age range for both groups of women was between 16-40 years. There were no significant statistical differences in the vocal, visual, tactile, and mutual gaze interactive behaviors between the two groups, nor were significant statistical differences found for gender, or gender and group interaction. Both groups of mothers viewed their neonates positively, as measured by the NPI. Implications for a qualitative investigation of cocaine exposed dyad seems warranted, since differences were noted anecdotally.

Scores on 8 QOL concepts were assessed. Black female controls scored significantly lower on all scales except physical function. HIV-infected Ss of Mixed race (both genders) reported poorer physical function; no other scale was affected by race. HIV Ss scored significantly lower on all scales; the majority of the decline in function occurred early in disease by WHO stages 1 and 2.

A backward multiple-regression procedure was used to predict raw Wiggins scale scores from parent descriptions as measured by the Personality Inventory for Children clinical scales. Predictors supported the validity of the Organic Symptoms, Social Maladjustment, Family Problems, Authority Conflict, and Hypomania scales, and to some extent, Poor Morale, Depression, Poor Health, and Phobias.

Foucault's (1978) view that the secret of the 19th century was the secret of sex, and suggests that, in 19th-century American culture, where African-American identity and equality were among the most controversial issues, the secrets of identity were also secrets of race. Because scientific and literary representations of pathological and/or secret essential identities are sites of intersection in the discourses of homosexual and mixed-race identity, they should be investigated as intersections, rather than read as codifications of sexual difference. A survey of the discourses of scientific racism, genetics, and eugenics suggests that F. E. Harper's (1892 [1987]) representation of the mulatto leader can be read as an act of resistance to the representation of the mulatto as a degenerate, hybrid species.

Edited Book",,,"(from the introduction) The purpose of this volume is to provide a collection of research and review papers that shed light on practical and empirical child developmental issues in the context of outdoor play environments. Although there has been a long history of studying children in many different settings (e.g., the home, the classroom), the playground is just beginning to be viewed as an important context for development that warrants further investigation. . . . Such environments allow researchers and practitioners the opportunity to explore child behavior and development as it naturally evolves in the context of minimal adult supervision. This volume should be of particular interest to both researchers and practitioners who work with preschool and school-age children.

Ss completed questionnaires, including the Crown-Crisp Experiential Index, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventories, and a measure of identity. Outcomes for both groups of adoptees in terms of adjustment and identity were generally excellent, although 10% of both groups had poor adjustment. There was no evidence from this or other studies that intercultural identity leads to unfavorable adjustment. Ss seemed well prepared by transracial adoption to participate effectively in a multicultural, multiracial society.

Results counter the interpretation that those who identify as ""other"" are of mixed race (mestizo) or misunderstand the question. Rather, the ""other"" response, it is argued, reflects a widespread view among Latinos that race is not so much a biological as a cultural, social, and/or political concept.

Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of information regarding how racially mixed people identify and view themselves and how they relate to one another. ""Racially Mixed People in America"" steadily bridges this gap, and offers a comprehensive look at the social and psychological adjustment of multiracial people, models for identity development, contemporary immigration and marriage patterns, and methodological issues involved in conducting research with mixed-race people, all in the context of America's multiracial past and present. Including contributions by ethnohistorians, psychologists, and sociologists, this powerful volume will provide the reader a tool for examining ideologies surrounding race, race relations, and the role of social science in the deconstruction of race. ""Racially Mixed People in America"" is essential reading for researchers and practitioners in cross-cultural studies, psychology, family studies, sociology, and social work.

The following abstract of the original article appeared in PA, Vol 77:29209.) Adoption is now seen as a form of child care, one of a spectrum of resources for children in need. Adopted children generally show a good outcome but are overrepresented in clinical populations. This trend is likely to continue as older children with histories of severe deprivation, neglect, abuse, and institutionalization are placed. Attitudes toward the adoption of mixed-race and older children are also changing: Black and mixed-race children are becoming easier to place. Developmental studies have thrown new light on revealing to children that they were adopted. Adoption disruption increases with age and other factors at placement, requiring further research into its origins and management.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Contends that the study of racial identity of mixed-race children in the UK raises a number of theoretical issues about the racial categorization system of Britain-in particular, the validity of the assumption that British racial thought is strictly dichotomous (perceived in terms of 2 mutually exclusive categories). In sociological literature of the UK and US, mixed-race people have often been described as occupying a marginal or in-between position from which they can only escape by adopting full membership in 1 group or the other. However, some sociologists suggest that it is possible for mixed-race people to steer a successful course between the 2 groups or to alter their racial self-image according to circumstance; ethnic identity is considered to be more fluid and dynamic than is frequently depicted. It is suggested that the dichotomous Black or White model of racial identity stems from analysis of the US racial structure, but investigation of racial identity in the UK requires a more flexible view of the racial categorization system.

Questionnaires and interviews with both children and parents revealed 3 ways that families dealt with racial identity issues. 18 of the families rarely discussed racial issues or associated with Blacks, and the children perceived themselves as different from other Blacks in terms of attitudes and culture. These children also held strong feelings of ""differentness"" and negative attitudes toward other Blacks. A 2nd group of 6 families acknowledged the child's racial identity and the need to provide Black role models for the child. These families lived in integrated neighborhoods, and the children expressed an interest in contact with other Blacks and often discussed racial identity issues with parents and peers. A 3rd group, in which parents generally had adopted several Black children, were characterized as interracial, and children were taught to emphasize their Black heritage. These families also provided a psychological support network for the adopted children. Findings suggest that transracial adoptions require special efforts on the part of parents and children and postplacement work on the part of the adoption agency.

Initial group encounters were intellectual and somewhat educational as Ss shared their life experiences. Armoring was used by Black and other Ss of color to promote self-caring during direct encounters with racist experiences. Co-leaders of the group were a Black clinician (the author) paired with a graduate student who had or was experiencing a mixed race relationship. Most Ss moved to the host environment of the spouse upon marriage. Group activity focused on establishing a definite identity for children and reinforcing it with models to support pridefulness. Group concerns about childrearing practices were racial: White Ss were criticized for being too permissive with children, and Black Ss were criticized by spouses for being too strict and by their families for being too permissive. Ss needed support and clarification around the question of what is developmental and what is cultural. Ss were trained to take leadership roles and continued meeting in their homes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,,"Studied the effects of race on observer judgments of nonverbal communications (NVC) with the use of 2 sets of stimulus slides, showing (a) White or Black males individually and (b) same race (White) or mixed race (Black male, White female) interacting couples. For both sets of stimuli, 2 levels of nonverbal behavior were programmed, a ""neutral"" stance and a ""positive,"" or in the case of couples, an ""intimate"" stance. The stimuli were presented to a 60-student sample and judgments were recorded on a set of 6 bipolar scales. Multivariate ANOVAs indicated that while NVC effects were highly significant for both sets of stimuli, race effects were only significant on evaluative scales, and this effect could be wholly attributed to an interaction of race and NVC cues. Thus, for individual stimulus persons, the effects of positive NVC are relatively attenuated for Black models, and for couples the effects of nonverbal intimacy are more accentuated for mixed-race couples.

The present study extended this work by comparing 2- and 4-person homogeneous and racially mixed groups of 31/2-5 yr. old children. Results indicate that the frequencies of initiations and negative responses were lower in 4-person racially mixed groups than in 4-person homogeneous groups. Also, the ratio of responses in general to initiations was lower in mixed groups than in homogeneous groups. Thus, racial awareness was found to inhibit social behavior.

The scores of the racial groups and the total population in general were superior in 1938 to what they were in 1924, but the rank order of the racial groups changed only slightly over the interval; the high-scoring groups made more improvement than the low-scoring groups. More improvement was made in the non-verbal test than in the English tests. 1924 group non-verbal scores predicted 1938 group printed English comprehension scores better than 1938 group non-verbal scores. No downward trend in non-verbal scores with increasing age was shown for low as compared with high scoring groups. There was a high correspondence between school achievement rank and rank order in test scores.

(4) There seems to be no reliable indication in early life of the later development of the disease. (5) Behavior difficulties appeared in two-thirds of the choreics. (6) With regard to mental disease, the greater number of the hospitalized cases were classified with the psychosis undifferentiated. (7) The average length of life after the development of the disease was found to be 16.1 years. (8) Exhaustion was the most frequent cause of death. (9) Seventeen cases of Sydenham's chorea were found to have occurred in otherwise non-choreic relatives; Sydenham's chorea also occurred in three individuals who afterward developed Huntington's chorea. (10) Other neuropathic conditions found in the families of choreics appear to be incidental. (11) The families were largely of mixed race and rural environment predominated. (12) Only 31 per cent of the choreics became public charges. (13) Potential choreics evidently do not abstain from marriage. Prevention will best be gained through education of the public to the dangers of transmission, in the hope that the affected stock will avoid marriage, or employ voluntary sterilization.
