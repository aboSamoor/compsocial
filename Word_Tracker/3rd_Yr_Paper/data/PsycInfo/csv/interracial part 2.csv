Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Explores how race is understood within an explicitly class-based movement, the Knights of Labor. It is argued that the movement presents an empirical puzzle: it simultaneously pursued racial openness and racial closure, and it justified both in the name of class interest. The article examines movement-level narratives of race and class to show how underlying conceptions of class become implicated in the construction of interests regarding race. Communications drawn from the movement's official journal provide comprehensive data for identifying and interpreting the movement narratives of race and class. There were 3 separate Knights of Labor narratives. They were Interracial Organizing and Black Workers; Competition, Democratic Citizenship and New Immigrants; and Slavery and the Social Position of Free Labor. Although each connected race and class in a different way, all were driven by the movement's understanding of class and to ""civic virtue"" as a particularly important resource.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Draws on feminist and post-colonial theory to situate an account of a 6-mo therapy between a Black, Asian woman therapist and a woman patient of mixed Pakistani-White parentage. While referred for depression and a pattern of abusive relationships, therapy progressed when the patient revealed that she felt like a 'black sheep'. The authors draw on this analysis to further the debates between psychotherapeutics and social theory, challenging each in 3 ways. First, in relation to the literature on culture, class, gender and sexuality in psychotherapy, the authors indicate how these enter into the therapeutic relation in distinct and intersecting ways, which, second, challenge the separation between inner and outer worlds frequently maintained within psychotherapy circles. Third, in terms of the correlative challenge psychotherapeutic perspectives pose for social theorists and activists, the authors highlight how the therapist's constructive and explicit use of her power and socio-cultural position was central to the progress of this client's therapy. Finally, the authors reflect on the broader questions around the theorizing of culture and gender within psychotherapy, including the available positions and representations of Black therapists as well as Black patients.

This study used a qualitative approach to explore ways in which Chinese husband White wife couples bridged their ethnic differences and how their individual ethnic identities were influenced by their marriage. Individual interviews were conducted with both partners of four couples. The husbands were foreign-born Chinese and immigrated to the U.S. between the ages of 17 and 27. The wives were U.S.-born and of European descent. Interview data were transcribed verbatim, categorized based on topic and compared and contrasted for the husbands and wives separately. Each topic was analyzed to identify common themes and findings, which were presented as results. Negative reactions toward the decision to get married came only from the wives' families. All couples seemed to have experienced either blatant or covert forms of racism. The husbands reported their ethnic identities were not influenced by their marriage, and three of the four husbands identified strongly with being Chinese. The wives reported increased ethnic awareness and appreciation. Ethnic differences that seemed to affect the marital relationships were: differences between the couples' role expectations of husband, wife and extended families, the husbands' emphasis on their children's education, and differences in parenting styles. Differences in communication styles were also identified, but did not seem to be solely related to ethnicity. The author concluded that despite strong identification with being Chinese, the husbands' ethnic identities changed partly due to being in an interracial marriage and partly due to acculturation. Their identities seemed to be unaffected by racial discrimination or the seemingly prejudicial objections by their wives' families to their marriages. Regarding ethnic issues, the wives seemed to do most of the accommodating within the marriages. Their willingness to do so perhaps indicated a reported diffuse identification as an American, or perhaps was gender related. Cultural influences seemed predominant in the husbands' emphasis on their children's education, exerting parental authority, hierarchical marital roles, and expectations of in-law involvement.

Forty African American children, ages 8 through 14, were recruited from after-school and summer programs in Louisville, Kentucky. A female African American examiner interviewed twenty of the children, while a same-age female Caucasian examiner interviewed the other half of the children. The children's interracial attitudes were assessed with an adapted version of the Preschool Racial Attitudes Measure-II (PRAM II; Williams, Best, Boswell, Mattson, & Graves, 1975) and the Racial Identity Questionnaire (RIQ; Crabtree, Wagner, & Leach, 1998). Within-group racial attitudes were measured with the Porter Skin Tone Connotation Scale (Porter, 1985), and global self-worth was assessed by the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Harter, 1985). No relationship was found between children's in-group or out-group racial attitudes and their global self-worth. Furthermore, there was no significant impact of the race of the examiner on children's responses to measures of racial attitudes. There was a trend, however, toward children interviewed by the African American examiner expressing more counterstereotyped attitudes, defined as positive attitudes toward African Americans and negative attitudes toward Caucasians, than those interviewed by the Caucasian examiner. A subset of children had their responses to the RIQ qualitatively analyzed, and several children reported a belief that teachers exhibit racial bias in the classroom as a function of both the students' and teachers' race. Furthermore, a pattern emerged in which children who expressed stereotyped attitudes on the PRAM II exhibited a preference for future spouses and children with Caucasian features (e.g., lighter hair, skin, and/or eye color), while those who expressed more nonstereotyped attitudes on the PRAM II reported a wish to have future spouses and children with African American features. The implications of these findings for psychological practice are discussed, including the importance of children's resilience in the face of racism and the fact that no significant race of examiner effect on children's openness was found in this study.

In addition, items that addressed components of the theory of White Racial Identity (Helms, 1990) that were not measured in the existing instrument were developed. These new scales developed from the WRIAS and new items were compared to measures of racism in social psychology to assess convergent and discriminant validity. They were also used to predict a criterion variable, the Reactions to Interracial Situations at Work Questionnaire (Block, Roberson & Neuger, 1995). Their ability to predict the criterion was compared to the predictive ability of the Modern Racism Scale (McConahay, 1986). The WRIAS was developed to measure five statuses of white racial identity: contact, disintegration, reintegration, pseudo independent, and autonomy. There have been numerous studies on the psychometric problems of the scale, with a one factor, two factor, three factor, and five factor model suggested. The current findings support a five factor model. However, the scale structure differs from the scales developed by Helms (1990). The five factors that emerged through this research were discomfort with and avoidance of blacks, curiosity about blacks, bitterness toward blacks, surface understanding of blacks, and unawareness of racial issues. Forty-seven items were developed to address dimensions postulated in the theory of white racial identity that are not included in the WRIAS. Six experimental scales were developed from a factor analysis of these items: discomfort with being white, pride in being white, belief in white superiority, belief in white responsibility for eliminating racism, awareness of white benefits, and impartial to race. The findings indicate that a multidimensional conceptualization of white racial attitudes fits the data best. The scales developed from the new items complement the scales developed from the WRIAS items, providing information on whites' attitudes toward race that more completely reflects Helms' theory. In addition, the racial attitude scales developed here provided a better prediction of the criterion variable than the Modern Racism Scale alone.

The primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether children exhibit an ORB, and to identify the relationship of the ORB to experience with other races in an eyewitness paradigm. There were forty Black and forty White participants at each of 4 combined grade levels (i.e., grades 1-2, 5-6, 9-10, and undergraduates), with the exception of 1-2-graders. There were only 33 Black and 40 White children in this group. Participants saw a brief videotape of a Black or White man committing a theft, then answered a series of questions and attempted to identify him from a 6-person target-present or target-absent lineup. There were no age effects for target-present lineups, as was expected, and age interacted with race of participant in unexpected ways in target-absent lineups. Surprisingly, only minimal evidence of an ORB was found. Since the ORB was small amongst adults, a group that had previously shown the effect, no definitive conclusions about the existence of the ORB in children can be drawn. Analyses of objective questions indicated that the youngest children were less accurate than were older children and adults. Concerning confidence, a significant three-way interaction between race of target, race of participant, and lineup type indicated that Black participants were significantly more confident in own-race identifications in target-present than in target-absent conditions, and White participants were marginally more confident in other-race identifications in target-absent than in target-present conditions. There was a small positive correlation between identification accuracy and confidence. Other-race identification accuracy was not related to the extent of other-race experience for children or adults. Finally, other-race identification accuracy was strongly related to other-race attitude scores for Black undergraduates, and other-race attitudes were strongly related amount of interracial contact for White undergraduates. Explanations for the findings and directions for future research were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"own-race bias, eyewitness memory, children","*Memory

The goals of this study included: (a) identifying the similarities and differences between groups and couples dating interracially and intraracially; (b) investigating whether specific love styles, conflict tactics, relationship length, family, friendship, and general public influence/approval, and ethnic identity significantly predicted relationship satisfaction; and (c) examining whether couple status (i.e., interracial or intraracial) moderated the relationship between family, friendship, and general public influence/approval and relationship satisfaction. Participants included 35 interracial and 58 intraracial heterosexual dating couples. The majority of the intraracially dating couples were White and the majority of the interracially dating couples were Asian/White pairings. Analyses included a repeated measures MANOVA, several paired post-hoc t-tests and a series of multiple regressions. The results of the present analyses indicated that there were no significant differences between couples dating interracially and intraracially on relationship satisfaction, love styles, conflict tactics, relationship length, ethnic identity, family, friendship, or general public influence/approval. Results also indicated that there were significant sex differences within each dyad. Furthermore, relationship satisfaction for the overall sample was predicted by greater family influence/approval, less friendship influence/approval, less psychological aggression towards one's partner, more passion and less game-playing love. Relationship satisfaction for the men in the sample was predicted by less friendship influence/approval, less game-playing and more passionate love styles. Relationship satisfaction for women in the sample was predicted by more passion and less psychological aggression towards their partner. None of the moderating relationships were supported. This study provides new information within the realm of interracial and intraracial dating and also expands the knowledge base in the area of dating relationships by exploring important dyadic differences which take into account sex and couple status.

The literature provides support for the theory that biracial identity is multiply determined depending on such factors as family, family history, community environment, geographical location, and historical time period. Findings suggest that racial identity is fluid over time and, often, situation; and it may not always be the most salient identity at any given time. Multiracial individuals appear to function as well socially and psychologically as monoracial individuals under similar conditions. Empirical research on this topic is limited and weakened by the use of small sample sizes, by the use of clinical populations as normative, and, in some cases, do not account for racism as a negative social influence.

The participants were interviewed using an interview protocol created for the purpose of describing their experiences of identity construction in their doctoral programs. The interview covered the following domains: (1) background and family information, (2) experiences in classes, (3) the peer community, (4) mentorship relationships, and (5) clinical placements. The study was conducted from a phenomenological perspective and its data analyzed according to a method of thematic analysis adapted from Georgi (1985). Results were presented on three levels: situated summaries for each participant of her graduate experiences, general themes frequently endorsed by at least two participants throughout the interview, and themes depicting participants' experiences in each of the interview domains of classes, peer community, mentorship, and clinical experience. Findings indicate that all of the participants expressed feelings of racial difference in their graduate programs. Participants described this sense of difference in both negative and positive terms: often they felt like outsiders in groups of monoracial people of color and like multiracial representatives in classes; they also felt that they could negotiate their way in multiple racial groups and form connections with others who felt marginalized. Participants prioritized their ethnic minority identities over their White identities: they focused on exploring and identifying with their ethnic minority backgrounds whereas they associated their White backgrounds with the privileges of the dominant culture. The study also found that although participants had multicultural courses, the large majority of participants did not have any courses which included material on multiracial peoples. Most courses presented the races as separate entities, causing participants to feel ""invisible"" or pressured to choose one race in their multiracial background with which to identify. Participants presented several recommendations for graduate programs, one being that courses include the psychologies of multiracial groups when discussing people of color.

The sample consisted of African American, Asian American, and Caucasian participants. The behaviors and cardiovascular reactivity (blood pressure and heart rate) of 123 dyads (126 females, 120 males) were assessed as they participated in same-sex interracial interactions. Participants also completed questionnaires that assessed their feelings during the interactions as well as their experiences with perceived racism. The results revealed that African Americans have the most experience with racism. Correlational analysis showed that perceptions of racism were significantly related to various symptoms of psychological distress, including depression and paranoia. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that among minority participants, perceived racism was significantly and positively related to a composite measure of resting systolic blood pressure. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed significant race effects, particularly in those dyads involving African Americans and Caucasians. Among the various dyads, Whites with Black partners felt the least comfortable during the interactions and had more reactive blood pressures than their Black partners. The results of analyses involving Asian American-Caucasian dyads and Caucasian-Caucasian dyads were less clear and suggest further study is needed. The analyses also revealed significant gender erects. Women were more behaviorally engaged and more comfortable than the men during the interactions. However, men had more reactive cardiovascular measures during the interactions and felt less friendly than did the women. The findings highlight the potentially significant role of perceived racism in the cardiovascular health of ethnic minority members.

Participant observation, group and individual interviews with parents and teens, and archives from the local, regional and national level of the organization reveal participants' lived experiences. In their own words, local mothers, fathers, and teens describe the integration and isolation that characterize their experiences as Black families in predominantly White suburban communities. Specifically, during their daily lives they are integrated with their White neighbors as extreme minorities (less than 1%) at school and in their neighborhood. However, geographic location and a lack of daily interactions with a larger Black community create a sense of isolation from their Black counterparts. Regional survey results reveal suburban teens' low levels of connectedness to their neighborhood, high levels of comfort around their White counterparts, and a great desire for more daily experiences with Blacks. Teens and parents articulate strategies for negotiating this marginalized existence. Moreover, African American adolescence is characterized by ethnic identity and same-race friendship development. As a result of residing in predominantly White suburban communities the ability to cultivate these friendships is limited. Although local teens report having strong relationships with their White friends, their parents report a ""birthday party effect,"" or change in the quality of these relationships overtime, but particularly at the onset of dating. Teen regional survey data and individual interviews describe Black friendships as more intimate and less conflictual than their White friendships. Same-race friendships are associated with adolescent physical self-concept, whereas cross-race friendships were not. Additionally, teens and parents discuss the need for same-race dating experiences, and the barriers to interracial dating, which include gender, religion, and race. Participating families join Jack and Jill of America, Incorporated to facilitate the development of same-race peer relationships for their youth. Data suggest that Jack and Jill has a history of elitism that sometimes overshadows its broader purpose and goals. Nevertheless, current and former members relate that by providing a socializing context for African American youth with similar daily and cultural experiences, Jack and Jill of America, Incorporated addresses the developmental dilemmas created by the intersection of the Black suburban experience and adolescents' need for same-race relationships.

This phenomenon, termed the ""own-race bias,"" has been demonstrated across a large number of studies and a variety of ethnic groups; however, the social-cognitive mechanisms governing the effect are poorly understood (Meissner & Brigham, 2001). The current investigation posits a perceptual learning framework from which to evaluate the underlying processes. In the first experiment, an encoding manipulation is undertaken in which participants are asked to sort faces of their own- and other-race into related groupings, and subsequently to recognize previously viewed faces and recreate the structure generated at encoding. In the second experiment, participants' eye-movements are recorded as they study and attempt to recognize own- and other-race faces. Results across experiments find support for two tenets of the perceptual learning framework, namely (a) characteristics of a skilled representational system, including greater complexity, number of taxonomic features, and reliability of retrieval, and (b) greater cognitive efficiency in the processes operating at encoding and recognition of own-race faces. In addition, prior interracial contact was found to mediate both of these factors. Differential recruitment of taxonomic features, the third tenet of the perceptual learning framework, found minimal support in the current investigation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study extends extant research on interracial violence research by using county-level data, drawn from South Carolina's National Incident-Based Reporting System, race-specific voting data, and demographic data to investigate the relationship between racial threat and interracial and intraracial violent crimes. White-on-black, black-on-white, white-on-white, and black-on-black crime rates are the 4 dependent variables analyzed in the study. Political threat is measured as the ratio of black-to-white voting in the South Carolina general elections. Economic threat, another independent variable, is measured as the ratio of black-to-white unemployment. Results from a pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis time-series analysis show that 1 dimension of racial threat, economic competition, has a modest substantive effect on interracial crimes involving white perpetrators and black victims--as economic competition increases between whites and blacks, whites commit more violent crimes against blacks. Political threat has no statistically discernable effect on the white-on-black crime rate. Further, neither measure of racial threat--economic competition nor political threat--is associated with the black-on-white, the white-on-white, or the black-on-black crime rate.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) A wedding serves as the beginning marker of a marriage; if a couple is to manage cultural differences throughout their relationship, they must first pass the hurdle of designing a wedding ceremony that accommodates those differences. This book documents the weddings of 112 couples from across the US, studied over a 10-yr period. The author focuses on intercultural weddings--interracial, interethnic, interfaith, international, and interclass--looking at how the couples cope with cultural differences in their lives. The case studies explore how couples display different identities simultaneously. The concepts of community, ritual, identity, and meaning are given extensive consideration. Because material cultural plays a particularly important role in weddings, food, clothing, and objects are given special attention. This book is a distinctive study of those who have accepted cultural differences into their daily lives and how they have managed to do so successfully.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Compared verbal IQ, number of sexual partners, and birth weight among African-American, White-American, and Black/White mixed race US adolescents. 4,271 African-American, 10,315 White-American, and 116 Black/White mixed race US adolescents (mean age 16 yrs) completed questionnaires and tests concerning verbal IQ, number of sexual partners, birth weight, parental education, and family income. Results show that African-American subjects(Ss) reported lower birth weight, lower verbal IQ, and higher number of sexual partners than did White Ss. For each characteristic, the mean of mixed-race Ss fell between the means of the 2 other populations. Birth weights were heavier as social class increased. In African-American Ss, the number of sexual partners was not associated with social class; those associations were weak in White Ss.

It is suggested that ideas from postmodern narrative therapy such as adopting a collaborative, curious stance, generating alternative understanding, encouraging a both/and stance, and searching for liberating tradition within each culture may be helpful with therapists working with intercultural couples.

Blacks are disaggregated into three ethnic groups: Black Caribbeans, Residual Blacks and, in the US, African Americans. The first group receives the most theoretical attention. Both raw percentages and parameters that control for several covariates--such as age, education and city of residence--are examined. The results indicate that, with or without controls and irrespective of ethnicity, blacks in Britain are significantly more likely to have a native born white partner than their US counterparts. These findings accord with assimilation theory, but the article's conclusion suggests that, in both countries, the assimilation of people of African descent operates differently from the assimilation of whites.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"There has been a significant amount of research that has indicated divergent patterns of leisure participation among African Americans and European Americans; however, there has been a paucity of research that addresses the leisure patterns of interracial couples and families. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the leisure patterns of interracial couples and families, specifically African American and European American couples. A qualitative design was employed to gather in-depth interview data from 6 couples (Ss aged 21-44 yrs). The findings indicated that the interracial couples felt socially isolated in various aspects of daily life, including work, family, and leisure. The primary cause of their social isolation was due to race and racism. The couples experienced low levels of comfort when participating in leisure within public spaces. There was not a distinct pattern of leisure activity among the couples; however, there was a distinct process the couples went through in selecting activities prior to participation in order to avoid negative social reactions.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper examines the ways 'mixed race' women in Canada contemplate their relationship to national identity. Through qualitative, open-ended interviews with 24 women identified as 'mixed race' (aged 20-55 yrs), the research demonstrates how some women of 'mixed race' contest ideas of the nation as constituted through the policy of multiculturalism in Canada. To challenge the tropes of the national narrative, some women of 'mixed race' develop nuanced models of cultural citizenship, illustrating that national identities are formed and transformed in relation to representation. Refusing to be positioned outside the nation, they effectively produce their own meanings of identity by working through their own personally identified 'mixed race' bodies to the national body politic, where some of them see their own bodies as intrinsically 'multicultural'. The paper ends by addressing the paradoxes of multiculturalism, emphasising through narratives that the policy produces hierarchical spaces against which some 'mixed race' women imaginatively negotiate, contest and challenge perceptions of their racialised and gendered selves.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In response to the need for increased understanding of the identity process of transracial adoptees, the Cultural-Racial Identity Model (A. L. Baden & R. J. Steward, 1995) was developed and tested. The model results in 16 proposed identities based on the degrees to which individuals (1) have knowledge of, awareness of, competence within, and comfort with their own racial group's culture, their parents' racial group's culture, and multiple cultures, and (2) are comfortable with their racial group membership and with those belonging to their own racial group, their parents' racial group, and multiple racial groups. Four dimensions of the model were determined: the Adoptee Culture Dimension, the Parental Culture Dimension, the Adoptee Race Dimension, and the Parental Race Dimension. The Cultural-Racial Identity of 51 19-36 yr old transracial adoptees completed a modified version of the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM; J. S. Phinney, 1992). Psychological adjustment was assessed by the Brief Symptom Inventory. Findings show that the MEIM successfully yielded variation in the potential Cultural-Racial Identities that the Ss reported. Findings did not support differences in psychological adjustment among transracial adoptees having different Cultural-Racial Identities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Health problems of the urban poor have been attributed to psychosocial effects of environmental stress. Testing such models requires an ability to measure neighborhood characteristics that make life stressful. The City Stress Inventory (CSI) uses self-report to assess perceived neighborhood disorder and exposure to violence. Data from an interracial sample of urban adolescents show the CSI to be internally consistent, stable, and correlated with census indices of social disadvantage. Validity for stress research is indicated by correlations with trait depression, anger, hostility, self-esteem, and mood changes during a debate with an unfamiliar peer. The CSI can be completed by persons with an 8th-grade education.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper presents recent work examining the meaning and impact of individual variations in the way bicultural individuals organize their two cultural identities, a construct the authors call Bicultural Identity Integration (BII). While biculturals high on BII describe their two cultural identities as 'compatible' (fluid and complementary), biculturals low on BII experience them as largely 'oppositional' (i.e., conflicting and disparate). The authors first report experimental evidence for how variations in BII moderate biculturals' socio-cognitive behavior, specifically, the way in which bicultural individuals process cultural knowledge and use it to interpret social behavior. The authors then report structural equation modeling findings that elucidate some important personality, contextual, and performance predictors of BII. Finally, the authors conclude with a brief discussion of how the study of bicultural identities provides an ideal ground for the integration of cultural and personality psychology.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the significance of ancestry on racial identity and its influence on healthcare. 20 individuals of mixed African-American-White and Asian-American-White ancestries (aged 45-94 yrs) completed interviews concerning self-identity. Results show that racial identity included the 5 dimensions of cultural identity, ascribed racial identity, racial identification to others, racial self-identification, and situational racialization of feeling. Mixed African-Americans described greater consistency in ascribed racial identity and a consistency between ascribed racial identity and racial identification to others. Mixed Asian-American subjects appeared to be less restricted by racial definitions. Findings suggest that the assessment of health care needs should not be based on narrow definitions of race.

The study attempts to describe not only the proportions of racial portrayals, but also the settings, activities, interactions, and products advertised in commercials in which White children and AHANA (African American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American) children were portrayed together compared to when White children were alone. There appear to be positive portrayals in many areas, including the presence of racial diversity and the portrayal of White and AHANA children interacting and communicating together in positive, constructive ways. However, while commercials featuring only White children were plentiful, commercials featuring only AHANA children were rare.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Patterns of racial classification in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health are examined. The survey's large sample size and multiple indicators of race permit generalizable claims about patterns and processes of social construction in the racial categorization of adolescents. In examining racial fluidity, the authors (1) contrast counts of multiracial youth obtained from common schemes of racial classification, (2) describe individual-level patterns of consistency in racial reporting, and (3) examine how youth who self-identify as multiracial answer questions that insist upon single-race responses. About 12% of youth provide inconsistent responses to nearly identical questions about race. The authors conclude that context affects one's choice of a single-race identity, and nearly all patterns and processes of racial classification depend on which racial groups are involved. The implications of the findings are discussed for users of data on race in general, and for the new census data in particular.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Addressed methodological limitations in tests of contact theory which the authors extend its theoretical focus to behaviors. Linking insights from social and cognitive psychology with contact theory, the authors hypothesize that prior racial contact will have significant effects on the racial diversity of contemporary social ties. Using the 1999-2000 Lilly Survey of Attitudes and Social Networks, a national sample of 2,561 Americans (mean age 44 yrs), a univariate and multivariate analyses was conducted to test the hypotheses. Those who had experienced prior interracial contact in schools and neighborhoods were more likely, as adults, to have more racially diverse general social groups and friendship circles. They were more likely to attend multiracial as opposed to a uniracial religious congregations, and to be interracially married. In general, these findings applied not only to all Americans, but to Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics separately. They did not apply to Asians. Contact theory can and should be extended, rendering it more fruitful for studying race relations. Except when groups are an extremely small percentage of the population, even limited prior contact in multiracial settings appears to have important effects on contemporary social ties.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Discusses how the definition of ""inappropriate relationship"" is likely to be highly dependent on the cultural and subcultural setting in which it occurs, and that any comprehensive account of inappropriate relationships needs to explain historical and cultural differences. Recent survey data has enabled some monitoring of attitudes toward interracial and extramarital relationships, as well as an understanding of the categorizations of relationship behaviors across cultures. Questions remain about why individuals persist in or pursue inappropriate relationships when the costs are so high, and when these relationships may lead to social retribution, loss of employment, prosecution, or worse. Several possible explanations are presented, including personality factors, sociobiology, social exchange theory, and cognitive consistency approaches. The authors conclude that the study of inappropriate relationships provokes us to challenge further our assumptions in the relationships field and to better appreciate the emotional and conflictual nature of relationship thoughts and actions.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Considers the historical and contemporary circumstances that have allowed ""old-fashioned"" and ""modern"" racists alike to deem interracial dating and marital relationships--especially Black-White dating and marital relationships--as ""inappropriate"". Specifically, the authors examine the processes by which stigmatization (i.e., the marking of individuals as inferior by virtue of their membership in socially devalued groups) simultaneously affect nonstigmatized and stigmatized individuals alike. Focus is primarily on the US, partly because virtually all of the published research on interethnic marriages is based on US samples, and partly because Black-White intermarriage rates in the US are among the lowest for all Western nations. Furthermore, focus is primary on Black-White romantic relationships, partly because the Black-White dichotomy underlies most of the race-based empirical studies on stigmatization, and partly because most of the published research on interethnic marriages has dealt with Black-White marriages.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Discusses provision of social services to biracial individuals. A biracial individual may assume a multiplicity of identities, including African-, Asian-, Latino-, and Native-American when negotiating with large institutions, including those providing social services. As an alternative to traditional, static views of race, the identity-across-the-lifespan model provides a more comprehensive paradigm for biracial clients. In the aftermath clients will be rendered visible by such an identity model, which prevails less on the basis of race and more on the basis of lifetime experience. It is concluded that biracial clients require the option, at least, to identify themselves rather than be identified by superficial racial characteristics.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The authors review a series of studies that illustrate how one form of contemporary racial bias of Whites, aversive racism, can shape different perspectives of Blacks and Whites in ways that can undermine race relations. This research demonstrates that contemporary racism among Whites is subtle, often unintentional, and unconscious but that its effects are systematically damaging to race relations by fostering miscommunication and distrust. In particular, the authors examine the effects of aversive racism on outcomes for Blacks (e.g., in selection decisions), on the ways that Whites behave in interracial interactions, in the impressions that Whites and Blacks form of each other in these interactions, and on the task efficiency of interracial dyads.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The authors conducted semistructured interviews with 38 participants in White racist Internet chat rooms, examining the extent to which people would, in this unique environment, advocate interracial violence in response to purported economic and cultural threats. Capitalizing on the anonymity and candor of chat room interactions, this study provides an unusual perspective on extremist attitudes. The authors experimentally manipulated the nature and proximity of the threats. Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicate that the respondents were most threatened by interracial marriage and, to a lesser extent, Blacks moving into White neighborhoods. In contrast, job competition posed by Blacks evoked very little advocacy of violence. The study affords an assessment of the advantages and limitations of Internet-based research with clandestine populations.

The authors introduce new topics, including vicarious traumatization of the clinician, parenting assessments, transracial adoptions, sexual harassment, child pornography, sexually aggressive youth, and the neurodevelopmental impact of violence in childhood, and telepsychiatry. More background material on law and more research in important areas such as the suggestibility of child witnesses and the effect of violence on children are included. This book is intended for a wide audience, including but not limited to, practicing clinicians, forensic examiners, attorneys, and judges who may wish to use it as a reference book and trainees in child and adolescent psychiatry or psychology who may use it as a basic text.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the relationships between specific communication behaviors and overall perceptions of Black and White communicators and sought to replicate the findings of R. Leonard and D. Locke. 18 communication behaviors were identified in the literature representing ""Black"" and ""White"" communication. 105 Black and 159 White Ss (aged 18-62 yrs) recalled a past interaction with a racial ""other"" and completed a 2-part questionnaire regarding these behaviors and overall impressions of the other. Pearson correlations were used to answer 7 hypotheses regarding these behaviors and impressions. Individual communication behaviors were associated with several negative race-type impressions, suggesting that macrolevel interpretations between interracial speakers may be problematic. Results also suggest that the exact order of stereotypes/perceptions might change from place to place, depending on how the instrument is used, and may be influenced by interpersonal interaction.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Used questionnaire responses from 1st yr collegiate athletes to explore potential relationships among athletic identity, racial identity, interracial contact, and interpersonal aggression. The authors found that a significant number of college students are influenced through their direct participation in intercollegiate athletics. Whether by forging self-identities as athletes; interacting with and working toward manual goals with teammates of different racial or ethnic backgrounds; or competing against opponents, the athletic arena is one in which participating students come to develop normative attitudes, beliefs, and behavior in a wide range of social areas. This chapter examines empirically how the backgrounds are prior experience of 1st-yr Black and White, male and female, scholarship athletes are related to the nature of their athletic and racial identities, their interracial attitudes and contacts, their perceived interpersonal aggression both on the field, and the nature of beliefs about their interpersonal relationships.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Stereotypes about Black sexuality fostered hypotheses that racial factors and racism influence rape victim blaming. 332 predominantly White and Asian college students (mean age 20 yrs) completed the Modern Racism Scale and evaluated a rape vignette varying victim race, perpetrator race, and rape type. As predicted, racial factors determined victim blaming. Compared to intraracial rapes, interracial rapes were less uniformly judged as ""definitely rape"" and were judged as having more culpable and less credible victims, and less culpable perpetrators. For men, racism scores positively predicted victim blaming in all rapes. For women, racism scores moderated victim blaming in interracial acquaintance rapes. In conclusion, the durability of racial stereotypes about rape and their influence on discriminatory adjudication outcomes is emphasized.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) This book is a long-range study of the impact of interracial; adoption on those adopted and their families. Initiated in 1972, it was continued in 1979, 1984, and 1991. These 4 phases trace the Ss from early childhood into young adulthood. The authors provide a broad perspective of the impact of transracial adoption and include profiles of the families involved in the study. They identify and compare the experiences of both the parents and the children. The authors also identify families whose adoption experiences were problematic and those whose experiences were positive. Finally, the study looks at the insights the experience of transracial adoption brought to the adoptive parents and what advice they would pass on to future parents adopting children and different racial backgrounds. They include the reflections of those adopted included in the 1972 1st phase who are now adults themselves. This 2nd edition includes a new concluding chapter that updates the 4th and last phase of the study. This work may be of interest to social workers, policy makers, and professionals and families involved on all sides of interracial adoption.

Specifically, the authors examined how response latency and self-report measures predicted bias and perceptions of bias in verbal and nonverbal behavior exhibited by Whites while they interacted with a Black partner. As predicted, Whites' self-reported racial attitudes significantly predicted bias in their verbal behavior to Black relative to White confederates. Furthermore, these explicit attitudes predicted how much friendlier Whites felt that they behaved toward White than Black partners. In contrast, the response latency measure significantly predicted Whites' nonverbal friendliness and the extent to which the confederates and observers perceived bias in the participants' friendliness.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget announced that a multiracial category would not be added to the 2000 census. This decision followed a protracted and heated debate. The primary reason why the authors undertook this project was to address the scarcity of empirical research that informed the 2000 census debate. The goal of this book is to provide analysis of a quantity of data that has heretofore been unavailable and to provide the quality of analysis that enables answers to important and enduring questions about racial identity. The addition of a multiracial category will most likely emerge once again as preparations are made for the 2010 census; therefore, the authors' hope for this project is twofold. First, they hope that this study will open a new path toward a more empirically based and less emotionally laden discourse on multiracialism. Second they hope that the findings reported in this book will open the debate about a multiracial category in the 2010 census to a more dynamic, multifaceted understanding of what biracial identity means to members of this population. The authors also hope that their work will be of interest ot parents of biracial children.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Self-evaluations after interracial and dyadic interactions were examined. 95 African American and White females interacted with either a same- or different-race partner in 1 of 3 role conditions: the high-status role of an interviewer, the low-status role of an applicant, or a peer of equal status. Following the interaction, responses to the Collective Self-Esteem scale assessed social self-evaluation, while the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale and the State Self-Esteem scale assessed personal self-esteem. Combinations of racial composition and situational role had striking influences on self-evaluations. For instance, when situational roles signaled a reversal from societal status, participants reported lower collective self-esteem than when situational and societal status were consistent. Thus, roles can have compelling consequences for self-evaluation after intergroup interactions.

Ethnic identity development may be an especially complex challenge facing biethnic and multiethnic individuals, who are often forced to choose one ethnicity. As children of interracial relationships, biracial and multiracial youth have legitimate claims to multiple ethnic heritages, yet these heritages are often not recognized due to skin color, appearance or name. This study examined the differences in ethnic identity development among adolescents, particularly focusing on multiethnic individuals, exploring the relationships among ethnic identity and self-esteem, ethnic identity and psychological adjustment, and ethnic identity and parental attachment. Two hundred and fifty-one participants completed four pencil and paper measures; the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1990), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), the Achenbach Youth Self-Report (1991) and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Greensburg & Arsmden, 1987). A series of one-way analysis of variance revealed that multiethnic participants scored significantly lower on ethnic identity than both African-Americans and Latinos. As predicted, Multiethnics showed no difference in psychological adjustment and self-esteem, as compared to their monoethnic counterparts. In addition, it was found that the relationship to mother and father was significantly correlated to psychological adjustment, but not to self-esteem. It was revealed in a series of multiple regressions that the relationship to mother, father and ethnic identity achievement accounted for 38% of the variance in psychological adjustment. Lastly, a somewhat limited finding is that having an African-American friend conferred the most significant contribution, predicting 8% of the variance in ethnic identity.

Empirical and theoretical literature concerning this population has been limited and often inconclusive. With continued growth of a multiethnic/multiracial movement issues concerning this population are becoming more salient. The current study investigated ethnic identity, self-esteem, and adjustment among Japanese-African Americans and Japanese-European Americans. The sample consisted of 86 biethnic adults (54 Japanese-European Americans, 32 Japanese-African Americans). Subjects were recruited at local college campuses, through multiethnic organizations, and through snowballing techniques. Subjects completed materials that were mailed to them. The study was correlation with a pre-experimental, cross-sectional design. Heritage Combination (majority/minority, minority/minority) was the primary predictor variable with Gender, Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity comprising additional predictor variables. Instrumentation included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) (Rosenberg, 1965), the Adjective Check List (ACL) (Gough & Heilbrun, 1965), and the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) (Phinney, 1992). Results of the study provided a greater understanding of the heterogeneity within the biethnic community and the need to look further at process as well as outcome. Japanese-African Americans and Japanese-European Americans did not significantly differ in their decisions to identify monoethnically versus biethnically, though monoethnic identifiers were more likely to be male. In terms of ethnic identity as measured by the MEIM, Japanese-African Americans were more likely to assert higher ethnic affirmation and belonging than Japanese-European Americans when education and parental support were sufficient. On remaining aspects of ethnic identity, the predictor variables of Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity accounted for a significant amount of variance in ethnic identity. Relative to self-esteem as measured by the RSE, Heritage Combination was not predictive of self-esteem, though the predictor variables of Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity added significantly to the prediction of self-esteem. In general, irrespective of heritage combination, subjects appeared to have high levels of self-esteem. In terms of adjustment measured by the ACL - PADJ, neither Heritage Combination or any predictor variables contributed significantly to the prediction of adjustment. However, in general, the sample represented a well adjusted group of individuals as evidenced by an ability to effectively manage life's stressors and to maintain a positive outlook.

An index of eating disordered behavior, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) (Garfinkel & Garner, 1979), an index of Africentric Beliefs, the Belief Systems Analysis Scale (BSAS) (Fine & Myers, 1988), an index of self esteem, the Rosenberg Self Esteem scale (Rosenberg, 1965), and a demographic data questionnaire were administered to two non-clinical samples of African American college women (one from predominantly white institution and one from predominantly African American institution). This was the first attempt to examine disordered eating in African American college women while considering the following factors: Africentric world view, interracial contact, participation in African American interest groups/classes, self esteem, region, community size, parental racial socialization, African American group evaluation, and peer and parental ideal body type for participant. Multiple regression analyses, analyses of variance, and correlational analyses were used to test the hypotheses advanced. The results of this study lend support to the following protective factors against disordered eating behavior in African American women: having an Africentric World View, high self esteem, being born in a small city, and being socialized integrative/assertive. In addition, there was a relationship between involvement in African American interest groups and BSAS scores. There was also a trend for participants with a negative African American group evaluation to score lower than participants with a positive African American group evaluation on the BSAS and higher on the EAT. Further, both parental and peer ideal body type for participant were good predictors of participant ideal body type. No relationships were found between region and eating disorders scores or between racial setting and eating disorders scores. Limitations of the study and suggestions for further research are provided.

Included in those numbers will be individuals who have two racial group heritages, though only one part of their racial background may be minority. Typically, these individuals will be considered, exclusively, as members of the minority community which negates the existence of their ""other half"". Existing research studies on the racial identity development of biracial individuals has been replete with studies on the identity development of offspring from Black/White or White/other unions, with little emphasis on the similarities and differences between these minority-majority biracials. This exploratory study serves the following purposes: (1) determine which factors may predict biracial identity choice for minority-majority biracials, (2) examine whether statistically significant differences exist between demographic factors and the psychological factors of biracial identity and self-esteem for minority-majority biracials, (3) explore the possibility of a relationship between racial identity and physical characteristics for minority-majority biracials. Fifty-six (56) minority-majority biracials--of Asian/Caucasian, Black/Caucasian, and Hispanic/Caucasian racial heritages--completed the Biracial Identity Attitude Scale, a revised version of the Multiethnic Identity Measure and the Rosenberg Self-esteem scale. Four of the participants took part in a phone interview to enhance the information collected by these instruments and add a more personalized perspective on the biracial identity process. Correlational analysis was used to study the relationship between racial identity, self-esteem, and various demographic factors (i.e., age, gender). Results suggest that minority-majority biracials tend to associate their experiences as biracials with their minority parent, although they may choose to embrace both of their racial heritages. Recommendations for parents, mental health professionals, teachers, and others who serve biracial populations are presented in order to promote a better understanding of the biracial identity process leading to more effective services.

The following instruments were used: (a) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965); (b) the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992); (c) Jacobs' doll-play instrument (Jacobs, 1977); and (d) the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children (Harter & Pike, 1983). Multiple Regression Analyses were conducted for 30 sets of Biracial children and their parents, recruited in Los Angeles and Boston. No significance was found in any of the linear composites investigated. However, a methodological issue was discovered which may have great implications for further research in this area. Namely, the possibility that a sampling bias may be inherent in studies of this nature as participants tend to be self-selected. Generalizability of findings would be seriously compromised if, as suggested in this study, participants tend to be skewed in the direction of having higher self-esteem and racial commitment. Future researchers are cautioned to use care in using the self selection process with this population. It is further suggested that findings from quantitative studies be viewed cautiously if nonprobability sampling is used. Studies of this nature may need to focus on seeking out cultural meaning rather than attempting to generalize these findings to the population at large.

Fifty-three biracial girls aged 11-22 and their White mothers participated. Thirty-four subject-pairs were interviewed in person and nineteen responded by returning the research instruments by mail. Daughters completed the Adolescent Interview Form, created for the purpose of this study to obtain quantitative and qualitative data about the daughter, the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents (Harter, 1988), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1979), a revised form of the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992), and the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1975, 1992). Mothers completed the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992), the Family Information Form, and the Parent Interview Form, developed to collect demographic and qualitative data about the target family. Demographic variabies considered were age, self-descriptions of skin color and physiognomy, and dominant racial composition of the neighborhood and school environment. Social/familial variables considered were perceived quality of relationships with extended family members, contact with other interracial families, amount of interaction between mothers and daughters on issues of race, and daughters' perceived pressures to identify with a particular racial group. Lastly, the relationship between patterns of psychological adjustment and racial identification was explored. The results of multivariate analyses indicated that the strongest predictors of racial identification were physiognomy and the amount of discussion of racial issues between mother and daughter. Girls who more frequently discussed race with their mothers and who perceived themselves to have more Negroid features were more likely to self-identify as Black or biracial, but feeling predominantly Black. Additional factors associated with such racial identification were a perceived good relationship with paternal grandparents, the age at which daughters first experienced pressure to identify racially, frequency of contact with other interracial families, and a high level of achieved ethnic identity. Self-reported symptomatic distress was within normed limits and did not differ significantly by racial identification. Self-esteem and self-concept were also not significantly related to racial identification. Findings are discussed in relation to contemporary theory of racial and ethnic identity development. Implications for future research are also addressed.

The 21 Ss consisted of 7 students from Southeast Asian backgrounds, 7 students from Filipino or Hawaiian backgrounds, and 7 students of biracial heritage. Five of the 7 Southeast Asian students, 3 of the 7 Filipino or Hawaiian background students, and 4 of the biracial students had high alienation scores on the psychological screening inventory. One Southeast Asian, 2 Filipino or Hawaiian, and 2 biracial students had high social nonconformity scores. Six of the 7 Southeast Asian students, 5 of the 7 Hawaii or Filipino students, and 5 of the 7 biracial students had high discomfort scores. 62% of the students referred for suspected drug use had used drugs, and nearly half had serious drug problems. It is suggested that the transition to Western culture disrupts the hierarchical family structure, interdependence, and self-identity of young Asian Americans.

The majority of the Ss have dated at least 1 Asian American male, however, interracial dating is on the increase, particularly, with White men. Factors affecting racialized dating included individual tastes and preferences and structural influences. Results indicate that controlling images have come to determine how males view Asian American females.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Race has been one of the recurring and critical themes of psychology from the beginnings of the science in 1892. The legacy of psychology with respect to race is a decidedly mixed one. It cannot be said that the concern of psychology with matters of race has produced the greatest accomplishments of our discipline, yet we have made some contributions that stand out. In the pages that follow, I will highlight some of the more interesting studies done over the past 90 years; draw out the implications of this work for our understanding of race relations; and point out some of the consequences of these studies for members of minority racial groups and members of the current majority population in this society. I will note some possible implications for psychological practice, assessment, and research in the decade ahead. In an attempt to follow some of the empirical and conceptual themes in psychology, I have chosen to focus largely but not exclusively on the results of research and arguments regarding Blacks and, for comparative purposes, Whites. Many, but certainly not all, of the conclusions we draw from such an analysis have relevance for the other racial groups. This chapter is organized into four sections. The first reviews some perspectives and lines of reasoning on race from early in this century. Definitions, basic conceptual orientations, and illustrative examples of research are presented. The second section addresses the question of the biological basis of race and the evidence for ""a race difference,"" and why it is or is not important to pursue this line of enquiry. The third reviews the evidence for continuing bias of Whites against Blacks--understood as the analysis of prejudice, racism, and discrimination--and proposes how that might affect the social and psychological responses of Blacks to interracial interactions. In the fourth section, selected areas of theory and research are considered, and some of the psychotherapy implications for clinical practice are explored. This will include the studies designed to assess ""racial differences"" and to understand foundations of behavior among members of racial groups.

The 1st drive resulted in ongoing interracial antagonism among Ford workers and the union's failure. The 2nd drive generated interracial labor solidarity and led to the union's recognition. One of the distinctive aspects of the setting was Henry Ford's paternalistic relations with the Black community of Detroit. Drawing from M. Jackman's (1994) research, the author examines the dimensions of paternalism and how it contributes to split labor market dynamics, in particular, and power relationships, in general. This analysis suggests that a split labor market based on paternalism can only be overcome by workers when another political actor intervenes in ways that challenge the stratification.

Little difference existed in the overall social integration of people moving to the suburban and city neighborhoods. Both groups reported making friends in their new communities and reported about the same level of interaction with and support from neighbors. Suburban movers experienced more incidents of harassment and racial discrimination, but these incidents decreased over time. Suburban movers were more likely than city movers to form interracial friendships.

Data are drawn from the F.B.I.'s Supplementary Homicide Reports and aggregated for 131 SMSAs over the 1976-1984 period. Unlike previous research, two out-groups-white and black offenders-are considered to see if the same predictors behave similarly for the different out-groups. As expected, the descriptive data show that Asian Americans as a minority group have a greater conditional probability of being killed by out-group members than do whites and blacks. On the other hand, logistic regression analysis reveals that educational inequality and population size are significant predictors of the conditional probability of out-group victimization, while hypotheses concerning the effects of relative group size, income inequality, and residential segregation fail to be fully supported. We conclude with a discussion of possible reasons for the unexpected results and of important tasks for future research.

Yamanaka (see record 1990-22338-001). Lee and Yamanaka used data from the 1980 census on Asian American racial and ethnic intermarriage, and found that one-quarter of married Asian Americans were outmarried; of these, 90% were married to non-Asians. Variations by gender and nativity were also observed. Women and the native born were more likely to be outmarried. The current authors expected to see a decline in Asian American intermarriage since 1980 because of high levels of immigration, growth of the Asian population, and increased social distance between Asian Americans and Whites. Main findings from the 1990 census data show that: (1) the overall outmarriage rate has declined, (2) Asian American inter-ethnic marriages (that is, marriages between 2 Asian Americans of different Asian ethnicities) have increased; and (3) social distance, measured by an Index of Intermarriage Distance, between Asian Americans and other racial and ethnic groups has widened. The authors conclude by discussing some implications of the findings for the role of racial and ethnic intermarriage as an indicator of intergroup relations.

The objective is to ""normalize"" these children by identifying and rejecting the forces that pathologize them. The racism, marginalization and alienation which are likely to impact on their world are highlighted, so that action may be taken to combat these. A lack of clarity as to the personal and political complexity of identity has hampered professional perspectives and intervention. The paper consequently explores, from a postmodernist Black perspective, the racial self-concepts that are available to this group, identifying their underlying agendas and their consequences. It concludes that the availability of the self-concept ""Black, with a White parent"", offered in the framework of change, multiplicity and individuality, is beneficial. However, any consideration of racial self-concept or identity is deemed productive only when combined with efforts to reduce racism, marginalization and alienation.

Some of the factors which necessitate the admission of mixed-parentage children to the public care system include ""family relationship breakdown"", ""physical abuse and neglect"", ""mother's mental health"", and ""child beyond parental control"". Moreover, financial and material hardship, the absence of the black father and of social support networks, families' experiences of racism, and the nature of social work intervention require serious attention. The multiplicity of risk factors paints a grim picture and presents important challenges in the work of the personal social services.

Trend data on the closeness and frequency of interracial contact among these groups are presented, along with Ss' evaluation of their own personal experiences with members of other races, endorsement of interracial ties, and degree of concern about racial issues and perceptions of relations between Blacks and Whites. Results show some convergence in the responses of Black and White youths, especially in the 1990s. The authors note that this result is not encouraging because it is the result of Blacks expressing less positive feelings about their interracial experiences and decreasing enthusiasm for interracial contact. Blacks' and Whites' reported behavior toward people of there races has become more similar as lower percentages Black youths form close interracial friendships at the same time that higher percentages of Whites do so. The degrees of concern expressed by Blacks and Whites about race relations as a problem confronting the nation became more similar.

The author states that this approach honors ideas that have sprung from the work of postmodern family therapists which can be helpful in fostering the development of family cohesion, multicultural perspectives, and antiracist strategies. An illustration of this approach is presented through the case report of a White mother seeking a Black therapist to counsel and serve as a positive role model for her 15-yr-old adopted daughter who was Black. The client was described as falling in and out of latent hostility and closing herself off from the rest of the family (consisting of the mother, father, 17-yr-old son, and 8-yr-old daughter) all of whom were White. The client was also reported to be experiencing problems at school. This case illustrates that, for the Black adopted child, identity issues are extremely complex and both the identity and family-building process is contaminated by racial prejudice and discrimination. Guidelines are offered for therapists working with multiracial family issues.

In particular Korean children had high IQs: 31% of these children obtained an intelligence score above 120.

Findings support this prediction and suggest that adult relations with family, friends, and community were important in fostering a sense of group identity. Also, integration into mainstream society, as reflected in interracial contact and adult socioeconomic attainment, was associated with less in-group attachment but more positive Black group evaluation. Adult socioeconomic status (SES) and interracial contact bolstered Black group evaluation. Findings support a multidimensional conceptualization of Black identity.

It seems that regarding the non-fictional portrayal of violence in the South African media, White adolescents are more desensitized than Black adolescents who live within these conditions every day. Black adolescents may enjoy fictional programs with physical violence more than White adolescents, but they experience more anxiety during exposure to non-fictional portrayals of events similar to the realities in the townships. They therefore tend to rate the level of violence depicted in news broadcasts higher than White adolescents.

Data was drawn from the core sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The Add Health public-use data set includes interviews of 6,504 adolescents and 4,600 parents. On the Add Health survey, adolescents were asked multiple questions to assess their racial/ethnic background. Results suggest that biracial/biethnic youth are a particularly vulnerable group in terms of self-reported delinquency, school problems, internalizing symptoms, and self-regard. As a group, they are also more likely to receive some form of psychological intervention. Given these findings and the shortcoming of clinical resources for work with this population, the authors provide a discussion of why biracial youth may be particularly vulnerable from a social constructionist framework and offer several strategies based on narrative family therapy for working with biracial youngsters and their families. The list of items used in making up variables in analyses is appended.

Ss completed the Marital Satisfaction Inventory-Revised and the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans. Overall, the interethnic couples were more similar to non-Hispanic White couples than they were to Mexican-American couples across multiple domains, with the latter group indicating modestly higher levels of relationship distress. Among interethnic couples, Mexican-American wives' level of acculturation related significantly to both their own marital- and parental-role orientation and to distress in their relationships with children, as well as to their husbands' marital distress regarding child rearing and the couple's interactions regarding finances. Implications for clinical interventions with Mexican- and White-American interethnic couples are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The life story of the internationally adopted child tends to be an emotional one. How the story is told and retold in the family can have lasting consequences for the child's adjustment and well-being. In telling the story, parents are faced with a unique challenge: To what extent is it desirable to encourage their children, who already struggle with identity issues related to adoption, to identify with their cultures of origin? Therapists working on these issues with multiethnic adoptive families can find little guidance in the family systems literature. To fill this gap, the present article reviews the literature on racial/ethnic identity development and the available research on ethnic identification, self-esteem, and the psychological adjustment of cross-ethnically adopted children and adolescents. Implications for practice include developmental considerations, identifying children and families at risk, and recommendations for those in need of intervention.

Over a period of 2 months, conversations of people with whom the first two authors came into contact were tape-recorded in a variety of social settings without their knowledge. The study revealed that humor, personal experience, and self-censorship were rhetorical maneuvers drawn on extensively in conversations about race. Two possible reasons for this are suggested. First, the conversations involved the interracial, heterosexual couple and other persons of different races, rather than only White speakers, as in many previous studies. Second, unlike previous studies, conversations occurred in naturalistic settings and not in contrived settings.

The results reveal that scores on the 43-item scale were internally consistent and that 4 factors (i.e., Multiracial Identity, Multiracial Heritage, General Adjustment, and Social Relationships) could be identified. In the 2nd study, the AMCS was revised and administered to a group of 187 Ss. Again, factor analysis yielded a 4-factor solution (i.e., Psychosocial Adjustment Self-Esteem, Multiracial Identity, and Multiracial Heritage).

Being in an interracial marriage had stronger effects on perceptions of men than women, and different effects on perceptions of minority group men than majority group men on dimensions of perceived racial identity and comfort with same-race others.

Participants watched the documentary, Racism 101, at home with others and immediately afterwards tape-recorded their discussion about the video and related race matters. None of the participants disagreed with the existence of separateness on campus, they did, however, offer different accounts and positions. Some criticized such self-segregation while others justified it as understandable due to commonalities or differences. Still other individuals were ambivalent or avowed conflicting accounts, which seemed to reflect a dilemma, such as wanting more meaningful interracial contact but being unable to know how to achieve it. African Americans cited preserving group identity as a justification for boundaries. The findings fit with racial formation theory in that participants are partaking in different discourses so as to articulate, explore, or criticize different positions on interracial matters.

Racial minorities, on the other hand, are likely to trade such assets for higher racial status. Whether race is a valued quality determines whether individuals will trade racial capital for other types of relational assets. However, previous research concerning interracial relationships has concentrated on couples who are already established; thus, the existing literature is of limited use in examining the initial decisions of individuals choosing to date interracially. In this article, content analysis of personal advertisements from magazines are reported. The mean age of male and female respondents was 38.62 and 40.8 respectively. It was found that race is insignificant as to whether the advertisers desired or sought physical attractiveness or financial security. Increased availability, not factors predicted by caste and exchange theories, is more explanatory as to why individuals enter into interracial relationships.

Differences in these correlations were explained with the ideological asymmetry hypothesis, a specific feature of social dominance theory, which asserts that the relationship between attitudes regarding hierarchy-maintaining social practices and antiegalitarian social values will be more positive among members of high-status groups than among members of low-status groups. Ss were 618 Euro-Americans, 475 Hispanics, 282 Asian Americans, and 474 Blacks. Using opposition to interracial marriage and dating as a case of a hierarchy-maintaining social attitude, the data were found to support the ideological asymmetry hypothesis. With almost no exceptions, the correlations between social dominance orientation and antimiscegenation attitudes were significantly more positive within a high-status ethnic group vis-a-vis a given low-status ethnic group than they were within a low-status ethnic group vis-a-vis a given high-status ethnic group.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"As the population of our society becomes increasingly diverse, there is a growing concern in our profession about the importance of culture in psychotherapy, counseling, and family therapy. Unfortunately, much of the literature treats cultural differences as a handicapping condition either for the therapist or for the clients. It is an unknown, something to adjust to, or something to overcome. The purpose of this article is to (a) briefly describe some aspects of culture as context in therapy; (b) state assumptions that undergird the development of techniques that can be developed to use cultural myths and traditions to bring about therapeutic change; and (c) describe some sample techniques developed by the author to illustrate how such techniques can be invented, adapted, and applied. Of course, the counselor first must gather some information about the cultural background of his or her clients. In these days of social acceptance of interethnic, interfaith, and interracial marriages, familie's cultural backgrounds can be more complex than in more homogenous societies. In these times of rapid change and the incredible mix of cultures in our society, cultures are themselves rapidly evolving in form and substance.

It is difficult to separate opinions and subjective feelings that are unsupported by empirical data from scientific facts that have been validated by empirical data. More subtle effects, such as individualism, cultural denigration, racial separation, and self-hate, are not examined. The weakness of transracial adoption literature is the notion of cultural homogeneity, and the nature of cross cultural research. The development and utilization of a Black developmental perspective, understanding of the influence of cultural features in adoption, and methodological consistency, are 3 general areas of concern.

Similarly, in a post-integration society, families tend to deny racism or any problems related to the transracially adopted child.

TAD is viewed through an international human rights perspective. The loss of cultural identity constitutes significant harm that should be of concern to state and national governments. TAD is proliferated because of the failure of the state to provide opportunities for African American parents to raise their children in safe and economically viable communities. Instead of comparing intra-racial and TADs, research should focus on TAD and orphaned nonadoptees. The psychological and behavioral functioning of the Whites should not provide the standard against which all other racial and ethnic groups can be judged. Efforts should be made to incorporate children's perceptions of the impact of TAD on the quality of life.

The conclusion that there are no harmful effects of such adoptions is premature, as certain crucial factors are still overlooked. Developmental status of the adoptee is an important determining factor for positive outcome of transracial adoption. Alexander and Curtis reflected inferred assumptions that are questionable. Lack of empirical evidence may not be indicative of no harm but may be due to the use of methodology that does not reflect the harm.

The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to conduct a meta-analysis of the correlations between cultural mistrust in 3,030 African Americans and their attitudes and behaviors related to mental health services use, comparing them to the correlations between cultural mistrust and measures relevant to other psychosocial domains, and (b) to test some methodological hypotheses about the Cultural Mistrust Inventory, the most popular measure of cultural mistrust. The meta-analysis suggests that the negative effects of Blacks' cultural mistrust in interracial situations are not unique to counseling and psychotherapy but represent a broader perspective. The meta-analysis also suggests that development of the Cultural Mistrust Inventory with a male-only college sample did not compromise its external validity. The implications of these results for the provision of mental health services to African Americans are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Race, discrimination, prejudice and stereotypes remain emotive words in numerous societies around the globe. A non-racial world can exist only if theories and postulations regarding race are rendered irrelevant. Subsequent to the 1994 South African elections, it became imperative to do this. This artificially polarized society had the opportunity to develop racial unity and hegemony. To assess the relative status of racist paradigms in students, 265 students completed a questionnaire which attempted to measure ethnic group identification and particular interracial attitudes. Significant indications of racist stereotypes were found in all racial groups, with a strong bias towards Ss' own racial groups. The primary conclusion is that racist perceptions and stereotypes remain very prevalent and active in the South African society. The author proposes a number of recommendations to address the issue, e.g., school curricula should include particular components to develop greater understanding/sensitivity of other racial groups; social emphasis should be on cultural solidarity rather than on cultural diversity; national governments should contribute funding towards setting up an international forum to study/combat racism, etc. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",http://dx.doi.org/10.2224/sbp.2001.29.2.125,"status of cross cultural racism & ethnic group identification & interracial attitudes, South African students","*Cross Cultural Differences

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Integrated schools may still be substantively segregated if friendships fall within race. Drawing on contact theory, this study tests whether school organization affects friendship segregation in a national sample of adolescent friendship networks. 90,118 7-12th grade students completed interviews. The results support contact theory on two dimensions. First, the author found a strong and generally positive relation between heterogeneity and friendship segregation, though the relation is not linear. This finding suggests that simple exposure does not promote integration. Second, the author found that interracial mixing within settings that capture the positive elements of contact theory (status equality and interdependent action) promotes friendship integration.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The contact hypothesis is difficult to test because of selectivity bias: the direction of causation between contact and attitudes cannot be definitively determined. Selectivity bias can be avoided given a sample for which, for reasons unrelated to group member attitudes, whites divide into groups that differ systematically in the amount of contact they have with blacks. This paper uses a natural experiment that provides such a test: All-Star voting by baseball players versus fans. The average white player has more substantial and persistent contact with African Americans (as teammates) than does the average white fan, and the contact hypothesis would thus predict that players will discriminate less than fans, all else equal. Logistic, ordinary-least-squares (OLS), and tobit regressions are used to analyze the effect of candidate race on votes received, controlling for other factors. No evidence is found of a differential in discrimination related to the amount of contact, although discrimination by both groups is found to decline between 1970 and 1980. The contact hypothesis is not supported; exogenous variations in the amount of interracial contact are not associated with difference in levels of discrimination.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examines differences in the social situation of intimate partners as an explanation of racial differences in the female to male ratio of spousal homicides in Canada. An analysis of homicide data from 1961-1983 generated by the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics revealed that the ratio of women killing their husbands to men killing their wives was highest for Aboriginals and lowest for Blacks, with the ratio for Whites falling in between. The possible sources of racial differences in this ratio included the proportion of couples (1) in common-law relationships, (2) who are co-residing as opposed to being separated, and (3) for whom there is a substantial age disparity between the partners. These factors were related to the spousal sex ratio of killing more generally. An exploration of interracial homicide patterns and racial variation in jealousy-motivated homicides was also undertaken. The findings revealed that controlling for the above factors substantially reduced the importance of race in predicting the gender of the homicide victim.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the extent to which social work students desire a multicultural education, whether social work students have a distinctive multicultural stance, and factors that influence a student's multicultural predisposition. 437 undergraduate students (aged 17-51 yrs) completed surveys concerning: (1) degree of acceptance of multicultural goals; (2) social work status; (3) liberalism; (4) amount of interracial contact; (5) egalitarianism; (6) stereotyping; (7) racism denial; and (8) racial resentment. Results show that subjects (Ss) demonstrated partial support of multicultural goals. Most Ss agreed that multicultural information should be used in the university setting and that the university should hire more minority faculty and staff. However, this support was conditional for many Ss: a substantial number favored the availability of multicultural classes, but were reluctant to make these classes a graduation requirement. Only a quarter of Ss felt personally compelled to learn more about cultural diversity. Ss' perceptions were not static, becoming more positive toward a multicultural education after they initiated interracial exchanges and completed a social diversity class.

Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the relative influence of friendship group characteristics on engaging in interracial interaction outside the friendship group, students' commitment to racial understanding, and gains in cultural awareness. A discrepancy was found between perceptions of racial balkanization and the relatively high degree of interracial friendship among students. The results also demonstrated how diversity might influence student values and learning. Variables in the regression models are appended.

Authored Book",,"(from the jacket) This book looks at how we capsized racial progress in the quest for self-esteem. It uncovers the hidden trajectory and terms of our thinking about race relations since the 1960s. Since segregation's dismantling, intense anxiety has surrounded interracial encounters, and a movement has arisen to engineer social relations through the specification of elaborate codes of conduct. Diversity training in business, multicultural education in schools, and cross-cultural psychotherapy have created a world of prescriptions. The author carefully analyzes the teachings of these self-appointed ""experts"" and offers a bold and searching analysis of the origins of their ideas in the human potential movement and the radical milieu of the 1960s. Casting race primarily as an issue of etiquette or therapy, rather than of justice or equality, has had dire consequences for American life, diverting attention from the deeper problems of poverty, violence, and continued inequality and discrimination.

A normal population was studied, and all of the participants were from intact homes where both biological parents were present. This study is important due to the lack of research specifically examining this unique biethnic subgroup. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight adolescent participants along with one or both of their biological parents. Twelve major categories and one minor category emerged from the data analysis based on the constant comparative method described by Maykut and Morehouse (1994). Major categories included: (1) Descriptions of others' perceptions of participants' ethnicity(ies); (2) Ethnic/racial category endorsement; (3) People/experiences impacting (bi)ethnic identity; (4) Positive feelings about biethnicity; (5) Others' questions about participants' ethnic heritage and participants' responses to inquiries; (6) (Bi)ethnic identity as contextual; (7) Perceived benefits of biethnicity; (8) Openness to having dating partners or life partners of any ethnicity; (9) Pressure from oneself or others to identify ethnically with one ethnic group; (10) Desire to become more proficient in the Spanish language; (11) Questioning one's 'Mexicanness'; and (12) Exposure to prejudiced comments against Mexican heritage individuals. The minor category consisted of feelings of social marginalization. The categories highlighted that the biethnic participants have been faced with unique challenges and experiences as adolescents with Mexican and European heritage. The categories were compared and contrasted to the existing literature on biethnicity. These data substantiate major points in the existing literature addressing biethnicity, and also add to it important factors that are potentially relevant for biethnic Mexican American/Euro-American adolescents. The results of this study indicate that the experiences affecting the (bi)ethnic identity of the Mexican American/Euro-American adolescent are complex, interactive, and ever-evolving. This dynamic process is influenced by multiple factors, including numerous personal, familial, and social variables that are interrelated. Clinical implications were also discussed and suggestions for future research were presented.

The importance of early identification and treatment for these children should not be underestimated. With the growth of international adoptions and a decreasing number of children adopted as newborns, the likelihood of early deprivation is more present. As reported by Bowlby, as children grow older the effects of early maternal deprivation become more pronounced. Various research papers have been previously published on this subject with various hypotheses such as children's inability to make relationships, a history of institutionalization, or multiple foster care placements as being a cause or central feature leading to the development of childhood behavioral disturbances. Other researchers found that the attachment patterns formed in infancy tended to persist across time and had implications for later emotional and behavioral functioning. Given that important prosocial values, attitudes, and behaviors may be learned in the context of secure attachment relationships, empathy, caring, compassion, kindness, and morality, the implications for insecurely attached internationally adopted children are not only personal and familial, but societal as well.

While quantitative and qualitative research has been conducted on the psychological effects of transracial adoption, little is known about the process of racial and ethnic identity development in transracial adoptees across the lifespan. Nine focused interviews were conducted with adult Korean adoptees ranging in age from twenty-one to forty-seven years. Seven prominent themes emerged from an analysis of the interview transcripts. The data indicated that some of the participants identify racially as Korean but are firmly rooted in the American culture. Others have developed a strong Korean ethnic identity as adults. Several factors played a role in precipitating an interest in learning about the Korean culture for some of the participants. These included personality, individual development, independence from one's adoptive family, age at time of adoption, and contact with Asian-Americans. The implications of Korean adoptees achieving a strong ethnic identity remain unclear. However, the results of this study support previous findings that racial and cultural identity is fluid, and that a reworking of one's identity may occur as one develops and encounters new experiences. Clinical applications and future research possibilities were discussed.

The main research questions that the study sought to answer concerned the relationship of marital/relationship satisfaction to stress, racial identity, and cultural values. Also of interest were whether stress acts to mediate the relationships between marital/relationship satisfaction and racial identity and between satisfaction and cultural values. Results indicated that stress and marital or relationship satisfaction were negatively related, as were stress and one subscale of cultural values. Stress did not mediate the relationship between satisfaction and racial identity or between satisfaction and values.

This research relied on qualitative case study design (Yin, 1984) and program evaluation methods (Guba & Lincoln, 1981; Weiss, 1998) to examine the influence of an antiracism intervention on the development of students' racial identities. The antiracism intervention was selected because it was a ""critical case"" (Yin, 1984) that specifically reflected the components identified in the literature as influential in students' racial identity development (college climate, antiracism curriculum, interracial dialogue, safe environment, and interracial contact). Data obtained from attitude scales, in-depth interviews, a focus group, and documents (e.g. writing assignments and journal entries) were analyzed to create themes about students' racial attitudes, students' racial interactions, and sources of changes in students' racial identity development upon conclusion of the antiracism intervention. Data suggested changes in students' attitudes, such as increased awareness and knowledge of racial issues, racial groups, and race relations. Changes in students' racial interactions involved increased comfort and confidence discussing race with people of various racial groups and increased desire to establish interracial friendships. Some unintended effects of the antiracism intervention included reinforcing students' stereotypes and encouraging students to limit their racial interactions. In addition, various non-intervention factors complemented the intervention's influence on students' racial identity development. Theoretical implications for this study relate to using an antiracism intervention to test what specific factors may influence students' racial identity development and how those factors may influence that development. Implications for research address the difficulty of measuring and securing rich data on racial identity development. Implications for practice relate to approaching the complex issue of racial identity development in a holistic manner.

Attitudes toward battered wives, as related to the race of the victim and the racial mix of the couple, were examined in the present study. It was predicted that participants (a) would view the black victim differently than the white victim, and (b) would view the victim in an interracial couple differently than the victim in a same race couple. In addition, it was predicted that (c) participants who had been victims of domestic violence would have more positive attitudes toward the victim, and (d) participants would have more negative attitudes toward victims of their own race. Two hundred and ninety-four participants read domestic violence scenarios and viewed obscured photographs in which the race of the victim and the racial mix of the couple were varied. After reading the scenario, each participant completed the Adjective Check List describing traits of the victim. Participants also completed the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale to provide information regarding domestic violence experience. The majority of participants had never been victims or perpetrators of domestic violence at any point in their lives. There were significant associations between lifetime and current domestic violence experience and participant race and education. The data failed to provide support for the hypotheses. Men saw victims significantly more negatively than women, and participants saw victims of their own race less negatively than victims of the other race. Results are discussed in relationship to previous studies examining attitudes toward victims, experience with domestic violence, and racial issues.

Perception of similarity and comfort with similarity to parents in intelligence, personality and physical appearance was assessed with a semi-structured interview developed for this research. The following measures of general psychological adjustment were obtained: the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Harter, 1985), the Relatedness Questionnaire (Wellborn & Connell, 1987), the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983), and the Attachment Security Questionnaire, a measure developed by the author that is a modification of a widely used measure of attachment in young children (Waters & Deane, 1985). The following measures of adoption adjustment were obtained: the Emotional Reaction Scale (Smith & Brodzinsky, 1994), the Adoption Loss Scale (modification of scale used by Smith, 1994) and the Adoption Defensiveness Scale (Smith, 1994). Results indicate that perceptions of similarity were positively related to psychological and adoption adjustment for inracial adoptees, yet not for transracial adoptees. Comfort with the extent of perceived dissimilarity to parents was directly related to psychological and adoption adjustment for both groups of adoptees. These findings are discussed in the context of stress and coping theory of psychological (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) and adoption (Brodzinsky, 1990) adjustment.

Despite this likelihood, little is known about the long-term impact of transracial adoption on African American children. In response, this study investigates the experiences and psychosocial development of a sample of 109 adult, transracial and inracial adoptees. Data were obtained using self-administered questionnaires, as well as questionnaires completed by subjects' adoptive parents in three related studies that spanned more than 20 years. The Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), modified versions of the Global Assessment Scale (GAS), the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI), and the Duke Health Profile (DUKE) were among the standardized instruments included in the questionnaires. Findings revealed that the long-term psychosocial development of adult, transracial adoptees was positive overall. Neither transracial placement nor racial identity was a predictor of adoptees' psychosocial development. Yet, transracially adopted subjects did experience numerous challenges related to the unique nature of their adoptions. In contrast with current law, data from this study call for child welfare professionals to routinely assess the racial needs of children who may be adopted transracially, as well as the ability of prospective adoptive families to raise a transracially adopted child.

Attitudinal components were also examined, including ethnic pride and ethnic preferences with age, cultural exposure and ethnic knowledge. Fifty cross-racially adopted children living in the U.S. (not born in the U.S.) aged 7-17 years old were interviewed to assess their understanding of the implications of their racial status for their social world, familial relationships, and personal identities, using the ethnic perspective-taking ability (EPTA) model developed by Quintana (1994, 1999). Specifically, ethnic perspective taking ability research involved examining the child's reasoning about ethnicity and observing maturational differences in their ability to understand the impact of their ethnic and racial status on their lives. In addition to EPTA, other components of the interview included questions about cultural exposure, ethnic attitudes, and adoption. An ethnic knowledge and self-esteem questionnaire were also administered. Results showed significant relationships between age and EPTA and cultural exposure and EPTA. Cultural exposure was also significantly related to ethnic pride and ethnic preference. There were no significant relationships found between self-esteem and EPTA, cultural exposure, ethnic knowledge, and ethnic pride.

Under most circumstances, blatant displays of interracial aggression are negatively viewed and socially condemned. However, if a covert mode of aggression is available, modern racists will utilize it in lieu of overt retaliation. This pattern of aggression may not hold, however, if modern racists are not motivated to control their prejudiced reactions. It was hypothesized that both overt and covert forms of aggression would be used in such situations. Furthermore, angry affect was expected to mediate the relation between Modern Racism and aggression when there was low motivation to control prejudice. Results indicated, however, that dispositional levels of internal and external motivation to respond without prejudice were better predictors of aggressive behavior. In particular, people with primarily external motivations were far more aggressive toward White competitors than other individuals. Also, they were affected by situational inhibitory factors more than other individuals. Participants were reluctant, however, to behave in either an overtly or covertly aggressive manner toward Black competitors, even when situational inhibitory motivations were low. Additionally, none of the various measures of angry affect mediated the relationships between prejudice and aggression. Discussion focuses on the multitude of inhibitory factors present in competitive interracial encounters, and the role of dispositional motivations to respond without prejudice in provoking situations.

Four male and four female individuals, between the ages of 23-28 years, participated in this study. These individuals were interviewed about the development of their racial identity over their life span, the salient factors contributing to their racial identity development, and the challenges they faced in overcoming and resolving conflicts related to their biracial heritage. Qualitative methods were used for data analysis. The primary method for data collection was the in-depth interview. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded, sorted, and integrated to uncover recurrent themes. Initially, each participant's responses were examined developmentally, from childhood to early adulthood. An examination of each case write-up, which consisted of summaries of salient information and relevant themes from each interview, was later conducted. Findings were that the factors influencing biracial identity development include: support of the nuclear family around biracial identity; openness to talking about issues of race in the home; living in a diverse community; exposure to a racially diverse and supportive educational environment; and having access to a biracial peer support group. Also identified were distinct shifts in attitudes, feelings, and experiences around biracial identity that occur over the course of an individual's life. Suggested areas for future studies included a study to explore the fluidity of the biracial individual's self-definition (as influenced by environmental circumstances) and its relation to the myth of the biracial person as confused in North American society. Another suggestion was to explore the similarities and differences in biracial identity development between biracial individuals who are perceived by society as Caucasian and those who are perceived as a member of a minority group. Based on the study findings, clinicians are advised: to familiarize themselves with local resources available to biracial individuals; to educate themselves around the developmental tasks faced by biracial individuals in order to support and guide their parents and the children themselves; and to consult, as necessary, with outside sources who have expertise on the topic of biracial identity.

Two hundred eleven adult African American males from various backgrounds were included in the study. Demographic (age, education, income), homogamous (similar educational, religious, and political backgrounds), and racial identity (the Racial Identity Attitude Scale and the Centrality subscale of the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity) variables were entered into hierarchical regression equations to determine the participants' willingness to date or marry interracially. The results indicate that religious background and racial identity development are significant predictors of African American men's willingness to date or marry non-African Americans.

The goal was to determine the strength of the effect size representing the difference between blacks' acceptance of interracial relationships and whites' acceptance of interracial relationships. Additionally, potential moderators of this effect were examined. The moderators included the racial and sexual composition of the couple (white female/black male versus black female/white male), the reporter of acceptance (someone in an interracial relationship or a relationship outsider), the relationship between the couple and the person evaluating them (family versus stranger), and relationship intimacy of the couple (dating versus marriage). Results indicated that blacks are more accepting of intimate black/white relationships compared to whites. This difference between blacks' and whites' acceptance was greatest when the couple in question was a black male and white female, when the reporter of acceptance was a relationship outsider, and when the person judging the couple was a family member.

The focus of this research was to assess gender differences in perceived love, empathy, relationship satisfaction, family influence, and importance of money and material things among individuals in current dating or marital interracial or intraracial relationships. It was expected that there would be a significant relationship between gender and perceived family influence (support or nonsupport) of current dating or marital relationship. It was also expected that there would be a significant relationships between perceived family influence and levels of relationship satisfaction for males and females. Furthermore, it was expected that females act on love and empathy more than importance of money and material things while males would report higher levels of importance of money and material things than love and empathy. Lastly, males would report more importance of money and material things than love and empathy than females. Overall, the research findings did not show significant results. Several limitations emerged from the study. Subjects age range was from 18 to 32, which appeared to play a role in the limited amount of experience with interracial relationships among the subject pool. Furthermore, the income of the subject pool was markedly lower than older adults who are actively dating regardless of the type of relationships they are in. Recommendation for future research is offered as a way to enhance this study.

Vol.61(8-B), Feb 2001, pp. 4410.",0419-4217,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"The purpose of this investigation was twofold. The first objective was to examine clinical and theoretical explanations for intermarried couples' greater risk of divorce compared to homogeneous couples. It was hypothesized that compared to homogeneous couples, intermarried couples would report less family support, more severe problems with religion and family, more discrepant marital role beliefs, and greater discrepancies in acculturation. It was further hypothesized that intermarried couples' greater discrepancies in marital role beliefs would be associated with greater discrepancies in acculturation. The second objective was to examine for theoretical and clinical assumptions that intermarried couples with greater differences between the partners (i.e., interfaith/interracial couples) experience more distress and difficulties compared to intermarried couples with fewer differences between the partners (i.e., interfaith-only or interracial-only couples). Finally, exploratory analyses examined whether group status (intermarried versus homogeneous) would moderate the association between family support or communication/problem-solving skills and relationship satisfaction. Participants were 150 heterosexual couples (75 intermarried and 75 homogeneous couples), engaged or married less than 18 months, who completed a set of self-report measures. Results indicated that intermarried couples reported less family support, more severe problems with religion, and greater discrepancies in acculturation levels. Contrary to the hypothesis, no association was found between intermarried couples' acculturation and marital role belief discrepancies. In partial support of the hypothesis, results indicated that among intermarried couples, interfaith-only couples reported less distress and difficulties compared to interfaith/interracial couples. Contrary to the hypothesis, interfaith-only couples also reported less difficulties compared to interracial-only couples. Moreover, no differences were found between interracial-only and interfaith/interracial couples. Exploratory analyses revealed that group status moderated the association between communication/problem-solving skills and relationship satisfaction, such that communication/problem-solving skills were highly associated with relationship satisfaction among homogeneous couples only, and not among intermarried couples. These findings suggest that differences between couples at higher-risk versus lower risk for divorce, as well as the differential impact of culture and ethnicity on relationships, may have important implications for models of marital functioning and divorce prevention programs. Implications and limitations of these findings were discussed and recommendations for future research were made.

Two hundred and five undergraduate students engaged in interracial and same-race dyadic interactions (44 African American-Caucasian dyads, 38 Asian American-Caucasian dyads, and 41 Caucasian dyads). Students also completed questionnaires that assessed their comfort toward their partners' racial/ethnic group and their feelings during the interactions. Multivariate analysis of variance and bi-variate correlations were used to analyze the data. The results showed strong support for the intergroup anxiety model. The race of partner comparison method revealed that involvement in interracial interactions did not cause Whites to automatically exaggerate their affect. The comfort comparison method confirmed that feeling uncomfortable did not automatically lead Whites to exaggerate their positive feelings. Rather, it was the combination of interacting with a minority partner and feeling discomfort that lead Whites to exaggerate the normative affect, increasing their positive affect and decreasing their negative feelings.

Infants were assessed 2 to 3 weeks upon arrival to the U.S. and approximately 6 months later to determine short-term follow-up status using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Second Edition. Infants also engaged in expressive behavior procedures to explore cultural and institutional effects on expressiveness. As a group, infants exhibited mild mental and significant motor delays at arrival. At follow-up infants showed significant developmental progress with normal mental performance and only mild motor delay. Developmental performance was scale specific and related to multiple background variables and anthropometric indices. As age at adoption and duration of institutionalization increased, mental performance declined. Neither variable was related to motor performance. Fostered infants performed more favorably than nonfostered infants on the BSID-2 at arrival and follow-up. Infants also showed significant anthropometric progress from time of arrival to follow-up, though their physical growth indices continued to be relatively depressed compared with American norms. Infants who were heavier, taller, and had larger head circumferences showed more favorable developmental performance. Risk factors for infants with significant developmental delays were identified. Expressive behavior age effects were shown with infants displaying significantly faster latencies to smile and longer durations of smiling during the peek-a-boo condition than at time of arrival. Age and culture effects were not shown in the gentle arm restraint condition. Findings from this study support the significance of institutional experience and subsequent adoption on the developing child.

Vol.61(8-B), Feb 2001, pp. 4418.",0419-4217,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"The Acculturation Model (AM) of Black Racial Identity is a model of how people progress though racial identity states to form bicultural attitudes. The model is based on the premise that if African descendants have social relationships with European Americans when they are growing up, they are more likely to have adult relationships with European Americans. It is further presumed that those from higher socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds are more likely to have interactions with Whites than those from lower SES backgrounds given the latter tend to function in racially homogeneous environments (Wilson, 1996). Moreover, the model specifies that contact with European Americans will lead to bicultural attitudes. Specifically, the AM has four exogenous variables: childhood interracial contact, adulthood contact, childhood SES, and adult SES. The endogenous variable is biculturalism. It is hypothesized that (a) there is a positive relationship between childhood and adulthood SES, (b) a positive relationship between childhood and adulthood contact, (c) a positive relationship between SES and contact in adulthood and childhood, and (d) a positive relationship between contact and biculturalism. Two studies were conducted to test the Acculturation Model. The first was a reanalysis of a study conducted by Demo and Hughes (1990) on the Black racial identity of 2,107 adults. The results of the reanalysis provided strong support for the interrelationships of social class, interracial contact, and Black racial identity as specified in the proposed Acculturation Model. Therefore, a second cross-sectional study consisting of a sample of 343 young, middle age, and older African descendants was conducted. Path analyses were performed to test the hypothesized model and alternative equivalent models. The primary analysis supported the underlying hypotheses of the AM. Additionally, a secondary analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVAS and t-tests to consider age cohort differences. There were significant differences between the older and young and middle age groups combined, providing further support for the significance of SES and interracial contact on biculturalism, the underlying premise of the AM. These studies were among the few to consider acculturation in the context of Black racial identity recognizing the multiple factors contributing toward identity development.

The key assertion in the framework is that the source of people's motivation to respond without prejudice determines their specific regulatory concerns for intergroup interactions. Internal motivation to respond without prejudice was argued to result in a concern with approaching a desired end-state of egalitarianism and, thereby live up to personally important nonprejudiced beliefs. In contrast, external motivation was argued to result in a concern with avoiding an undesired end-state of social disapproval that would result if one were to express bias. These regulatory concerns were expected to influence a broad range of people's responses in the context of intergroup interactions, including their intended goals and strategies as well as their interest in pursuing a strategy to reduce their bias toward Black people. The first two studies examined people's intended goals and strategies for interracial interactions. Supporting the proposed framework, internal motivation resulted in approach-related goals and intended strategies, indicating a concern with approaching egalitarianism. External motivation resulted in avoidance-related goals and intended strategies, indicating a concern with avoiding social disapproval that would result from bias. In addition, to the extent that people expected to respond with bias in interracial interactions, internally motivated people pursued any strategy likely to eliminate bias and, thereby, approach egalitarianism. In contrast, people primarily externally motivated pursued a strategy only if it would reduce overt bias and, thereby, avoid social disapproval. These findings demonstrated that a full understanding how people regulate their prejudice for interracial interactions requires examining the reasons why people are motivated to respond without prejudice. In addition, the current work established the utility of identifying people's regulatory concerns for interracial interactions.

The relationship ecologies of four such couples were investigated through a qualitative study designed to examine their perceptions of their such relationships. [Note: In this study all couples were married; consequently, the terms intimate and married are used interchangeably when referring to these couples.] The narrative information portraying the married couples' relational experiences was obtained through the Relationship Ecology Interview (REI), an interview protocol designed for the study. The REI protocol assessed the couples' appraisal of their management of socio- and psychocultural tasks and challenges within their relationship ecology (Fontaine, 1990). The narrative commentaries of the couples' interpretations of their relationship experiences are illustrated employing both Susan E. Chase's (1995) narrative analysis style and her theoretical propositions about the tension between individual achievement and inequalities in American society. Couples' narrative analyses revealed that as they communicated their relationship experiences, they simultaneously reflected on various cultural discourses about individual achievement (how they successfully managed their relationships) and inequality (how they experienced cultural, social, political barriers) within their relationship ecologies. Couples demonstrated confidence in their intercultural relationship qualifications accomplishing instrumental and affective relationship tasks. However, they acknowledge race discrimination and social, cultural, and political inequalities that determine their relationship experiences. Unlike the experiences of intracultural couples, Africanand European-American couples' discursive narratives reveal they must remain alert to the possibilities of racist treatment.

Advanced stages of racial identity development correlate with increased parent pro-activity in discussing race with their children. Factors contributing to these findings are discussed along with the need for more research to determine the psychological impact of which differences in parents racial socialization practices exert on biracial children's racial identity and healthy personality development.

There currently is no clear theory of Black/White Biracial identity development available for use by professional counselors. The purpose of this study was to utilize the grounded theory approach to identify the process through which an individual develops a Biracial identity. Strauss and Corbin's (1998) techniques and procedures for developing grounded theory were utilized to develop a theory of Biracial identity development. Interviews were conducted with seven Biracial individuals from Hunt County, Texas. All participant interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed. To ensure accuracy of data, all transcriptions were verified for accuracy. Strauss and Corbin's analysis recommendations were used to analyze data and included: (a) open coding, the process that leads to the identification of concepts and their properties; (b) axial coding, the process of relating categories to subcategories; and (c) selective coding, the process of integrating and refining the theory. Participants' responses suggested that Biracial individuals develop a Biracial Identity following the movement through several phases or periods of development. The Biracial Identity is a positive expression of pride in being Biracial. The model of Biracial Identity Development includes the following phases: (a) neutrality, that phase when the individual is not aware of race; (b) acceptance, that period when the individual accepts being racially different; (c) awareness, that period when individuals become aware that they have no racial group with which to identify; (d) experimentation, that period when the individual begins to seek a racial identity; (e) transition, that period during which the individual begins to develop his or her own racial identity; and (f) recognition, that period during which the individual recognizes his or her Biracial identity. Study participants demonstrated that they, like single race individuals, experience a developmental process leading to the recognition of a racial identity. Biracial individuals have been thought to exist without having a racial identity and were viewed as not being accepted by society. This study theorizes that not only do Biracial individuals have a racial identity, they are proud of being Biracial.

Eleven White mothers, married to African-American men and raising adolescent children were interviewed about their experiences. The majority of these women are socializing their children with a focus on African-American culture but not fostering a sense of ethnicity related to the mother's ethnic background. Through their parenting of their Biracial children, the mothers have come to a greater sense of their own racial identity recognizing White privilege and their own White identity. Their children identify as Biracial but with a public Black identity, their identity is neither linear nor progressive but varies between Black and Biracial depending on social situations. Adolescents has not been a stressful time. The mothers attempt to foster coping skills by choosing carefully where to live, promoting discussions on racial issues, reinforcing African-American culture, warning their children about societal hostility and joining peer support groups.

Results show no effect of interracial-ethnic dyads on any examined decision points. Extralegal variables such as defendant substance abuse at time of offence attained or approached significance in all decisions, while victim substance abuse failed to even approach significance in all models. Marital status and cohabitation failed to play a role. Victim cooperation approached significance in filing charges and became highly significant in prosecution. Victim prior arrest and cooperation were not relevant to severity of charges filed nor conviction charge. Victim injury and severity of attack were not significant on decision to file charges. It is concluded that there is no significant effect of interracial violence on any of the five outcome measures examined.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Investigated conversational strategies used by African Americans to communicate with European Americans, based on a previously developed model of interethnic communication. This model assumes that interethnic and interracial communication is problematic and comprises 4 components: ethnic/racial identity, communication issues, conversational improvement strategies used to deal with the communication issues, and communication satisfaction. The research elaborated the conversational improvement strategies component. 133 22-75 yr old African Americans returned questionnaires in which they were asked to identify and describe conversational strategies used to deal with 7 specific communication issues: acceptance, understanding, negative stereotyping, goal attainment, powerlessness, expressiveness, and authenticity. Ss reported using 12 conversational strategies, ranging from accommodating (be friendly, treat as individual) to more divergent (assertiveness, avoidance, confrontation) strategies. Interviews conducted with 10 Ss concerning their interracial interaction in a specific context: an organizational setting. Both survey and interview results are seen to confirm the basic model and reveal interesting relationships among the communication issues and the conversational strategies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Marital happiness depends on many factors, and homogeneity of race and culture between the couple is surely among them. Over the past three decades, inter-racial marriages have increased rapidly, from 310,000 to more than 1.1 million, and their proportion among all marriages grew from 0.7% in 1970 to over 2.2% in the mid-1990s. In the meantime, the rate of divorce among all marriages in the cohorts of the 1980s and the 1990s reached between 50% and 67%. Intermarriage and divorce have been both extensively studied, but marital happiness among inter-married couples is seldom reported in the literature. In this article, the authors raise a research question whether marital stability and happiness are related to the racial and cultural background of married coup1es (aged 20-80 yrs), and examine self-reported marital happiness among a sample from a multi-ethnic community in Hawaii. The differential effect of race and culture on marital happiness will be given special emphasis in this study.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Racial prejudice in the courtroom is examined through a historical sketch of racism in the legal system, a review of psychological research on White juror bias, and a study investigating White mock jurors' judgments of a fictional trial summary. The central hypothesis is that salient racial issues at trial activate the normative racial attitudes held by White jurors. In previous eras, these racial norms encouraged overtly anti-Black prejudice. But in modern America, many Whites embrace an egalitarian value system and try to behave in an appropriately nonprejudiced manner when race is salient. Therefore, contrary to the intuition of many scholars and researchers, contemporary White jurors are more likely to demonstrate racial bias against a Black defendant in interracial trials without blatantly racial issues. Empirical data suggest that this pattern of bias is not limited to one type of crime or one type of racial issue. Practical implications and future research directions are considered.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The current article reviews the own-race bias (ORB) phenomenon in memory for human faces, the finding that own-race faces are better remembered when compared with memory for faces of another, less familiar race. Data were analyzed from 39 research articles, involving 91 independent samples and nearly 5,000 participants. Measures of hit and false alarm rates, and aggregate measures of discrimination accuracy and response criterion were examined, including an analysis of 8 study moderators. Several theoretical relationships were also assessed (i.e., the influence of racial attitudes and interracial contact). Overall, results indicated a ""mirror effect"" pattern in which own-race faces yielded a higher proportion of hits and a lower proportion of false alarms compared with other-race faces. Consistent with this effect, a significant ORB was also found in aggregate measures of discrimination accuracy and response criterion. The influence of perceptual learning and differentiation processes in the ORB are discussed, in addition to the practical implications of this phenomenon.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Two studies examined whether developing a common ingroup identity among Blacks and Whites can improve Whites' interracial evaluations. In Study 1, 53 White participants interacted with a Black or White confederate under conditions designed to produce cognitive representations as fellow group members or as separate individuals. Consistent with the Common Ingroup Identity Model, Whites evaluated Blacks more favorably when they interacted with them as members of the same group than as separate individuals. Study 2, was conducted using 183 fans entering a football stadium, Ss were asked to complete an interview regarding food preferences. Results revealed that Whites complied more frequently with a Black interviewer's request to interview them when they shared common university affiliation, relative to when the Black interviewer was affiliated with the opposing team.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Addresses the issues that arise in therapy for intermarried couples, whose difficulties also include different culture-rooted beliefs and traditions. Common problems encountered by intermarried couples include: misguided expectations based on projected beliefs about other cultures; shift in implicit ethnic/racial hierarchy; difficulties in communication; differences in ways of coping; incompatibility between two cultures; different concepts in family boundaries and obligations and role division between spouses; different childrearing practices; and problems arising from the community's reaction toward intermarriage. Issues in therapy with intermarried couples include: being sensitive to cultural perceptions of therapy held by each partner; considering ethnic matching and therapeutic neutrality; emphasizing positive forces and common ground; promoting cultural knowledge, understanding, and skills; clarifying culture influences vs. personal factors; promoting flexibility and appreciation of differences; and avoiding too culturally-specific approaches. Several case vignettes are included to illustrate these issues.

The purposes are fourfold: to describe, nonclinical subjective experiences of being biracial in the US, to explore the differences in the paths that 2 biracial individuals can take to achieve what looks superficially like similar Black racial identity resolution, to demonstrate how identifying as Black can have different meanings and consequences for 2 biracial people, and to contribute to the differentiation of Black RID from biracial Black/White RID.

It is noted that 38% of voters rejected the removal of South Carolina's antimiscegenation law. Macro-level analysis of the South Carolina elections suggest that a significant amount of animosity continues to exist toward interracial primary relationships. Findings also indicate that the effect of Black/White income inequality matters, indicating the importance of status differences between groups. This finding implies that decreases in Black/White income inequality can increase support for interracial marriage. Yet, it also means that because there is much income inequality between Blacks and Whites, the support and opportunity for interracial marriage is reduced. Implications for the role of education are also discussed.

Results reflect the ways in which interracial couples struggle to employ, resist, and transform the discourse of homogamy in their relationship. Black spouses compared to White spouses demonstrated a greater awareness of and sensitivity to social resistance to the constitution of their relationship, and Black spouses' familial and personal histories were sometimes relegated to silence in the couple relationship. Implications for family therapists working with interracial couples are discussed.

Following the differentiation of cultural competence as defined in the social work literature and cultural competence as applied to TRA parents, a three-part definition of cultural competence for TRA parents is presented. The article expands on each of three constructs: racial awareness, multicultural planning, and survival skills, In addition, it describes the process of beginning to operationalize the constructs. Finally, implications for social work practice, education, and research are suaaested.

It is argued that (1) during the formation of multicultural relationships, satisfaction is promoted to the extent that partners genuinely appreciate, rather than simply tolerate, the differences in their respective personalities; (2) after multicultural relationships have been formed, satisfaction is maintained to the extent that partners jointly create and sustain relationship cultures that are uniquely theirs; and (3) throughout the development and maintenance of multicultural relationships, satisfaction is created and sustained to the extent that relationship partners are open to personal growth via their association with a partner who contributed to their growth, in part due to being from a different culture/ethnic group.

The authors, using the triangular structure as observation and analysis units, to whose vertexes they put the family's system (meaning with this term not just the adoptive couple, but also the wider three generational system), the child's system and the social operators's system, highlight a series of common factors concerning the examinated cases, that either alone or interacting among themselves, could have brought about the restitution of foreign children and that, generally, could most likely jeopardize an international adoption.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the conversational styles employed by students attending a desegregated middle school while discussing race. Students discussed issues related to race in focus groups initially comprised solely of White, Black, or nondominant individuals. Subsequently, subjects (Ss) then convened in mixed-race groups, with conversation styles examined. Results show that Ss employed 2 distinct types of conversational styles. In the 1st type, which may be labeled ""bridging talk"", Ss used multiple strategies to build unity across differences. In the 2nd type, ""conflict talk,"" Ss discursively created borders and conflict. Findings suggest promises and challenges for each type of discussion. A 3rd form for consideration, ""democratic conversation,"" would invite perspectives while acknowledging the privileging and silencing that accompany them. It is concluded that educators should hold conversations that explicitly address the power dynamics inherent in such conversations and teach the conceptual tools and language to identify these dynamics. Although these conversations across racial lines are sometimes threatening and difficult, they are a critical component of democratic education.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In-depth qualitative interviews with 4 women, aged 39-47 yrs, who chose to become single mothers through international adoption were used to explore the influences, life experiences, and social factors that made their unconventional choice possible. Four themes emerging from the grounded theory analysis are addressed: (1) moral issues; (2) fear and prejudice; (3) agency; and (4) support. It is concluded that results give a new face and voice to the single mother, expanding our understanding of postmodern families and challenging currently available narratives of single mothers.

From this group, 76 parents with adopted children aged 15 yrs and older completed a questionnaire which gathered in-depth information on themselves and their children. 57 adoptees (mean age 22.6 yrs) completed questionairs assessing their schooling, work, relationships, and well-being. Results show that of the 146 adoptees, 67 were identified as having a significant disability. From a subjective orientation, the adoptees reported satisfaction with their lives & were optimistic about their futures. The presence or absence of a disability did not appear to interfere with their self appraisal.

Analysis indicated a high willingness in all ethnic groups to be romantically involved as well as an absence of sex difference with regard to both attitude and experience. However, there were differences in both attitude and experience among ethnic groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Discusses self-constructions of migrant Indo-Dutch females living in the Netherlands. As the progeny of Dutch males and Indonesian females during the centuries of Dutch occupation of Indonesia, Indo-Dutch individuals occupied an ambiguous role, perceived as distinct from and above the native Indonesian population, but subordinate to the dominant White society. Rather than be viewed as assimilated objects, these migrant, Indo-Dutch females are regarded by Dutch Whites as agents who effectively intervene in the construction of national identities through masquerading strategies and ways of communication. Through the model of masquerading, Indo-Dutchness can be conceptualized as a mode of cultural negotiation and intervention. Such masquerading strategies form a part of the conflicted colonial history of Indo-Dutch females.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a versatile technique for understanding and displaying the structure of multivariate data. This technique has seen wide application in the behavioral sciences and has led to increased understanding of complex psychological phenomena. MDS has been used to assess cognitive developmental theories, study interracial relations among children, determine consumer preferences, and evaluate the dimensional structure and content validity of tests and questionnaires. In this chapter, we limit the discussion to MDS applications founded on distance assumptions; that is, the assumption that the essential features of the proximity data can be represented as a stochastic function of symmetric distances among stimuli in a multidimensional space spanned by continuous, latent dimensions. MDS will continue to be a major tool of perception research. Statistical developments will continue on methods for constrained analyses, methods for estimating the precision of parameter estimates, explicit models for derived proximity matrices, methods for reducing the respondent labor in studies using direct proximity judgments, and for estimating scale values in models.

In Study 1, the defendant's race did not influence White college students' decisions but Black students demonstrated ingroup/outgroup bias in their guilt ratings and attribution for the defendant's behavior. The aversive nature of modern racism suggests that Whites are motivated to appear nonprejudiced when racial issues are salient; therefore, the race salience of a trial summary was manipulated and given to noncollege students in Study 2. Once again, the defendant's race did not influence Whites when racial issues were salient but in the non-race-salient version of the same interracial case, White mock jurors rated the Black defendant more guilty, aggressive, and violent than the White defendant. Black mock jurors demonstrated same-race leniency in both versions of the trial, suggesting that racial issues are generally salient in the minds of Black jurors in interracial cases with Black defendants.

Nineteen mother-child dyads were included in this study. A qualitative analysis of the three interviews, which included an initial interview, the Working Model of the Child Interview, and a debriefing interview, lead to the central perspective of Transformation through Reconciliation. Mothers worked towards a transformation to mother-by-adoption while making peace with themselves and embracing their daughters. The two stages of pre-adoption and post-adoption provided the framework within which the mothers worked the specific tasks of this process. This work involved four major tasks including the emotional thread of Resolution of loss, trauma, and fear; the psychological thread of Re-construction of internal working models; the environmental thread of Forging a baby space; and the relationship thread of Relating to the real baby. The quality of the work done by each mother supported the two variations of outcomes, including balanced and unbalanced dyadic relationships. Several quantitative measures were used to provide descriptive data. These included the Parental Stress Inventory, the Infant-Toddler Symptom Checklist, and the Mother-Child Interaction Scale. These instruments provided information on the number of stresses the mothers experienced with regard to the child, themselves and the dyad, the number and quality of sensory difficulties that mothers identified in their children, and the number of specific mother-child interaction qualities identified by the mothers.

Each spouse of the 93 married couples, 31 of whom were Black, 31 White and 31 Interracial (Black-White) were mailed both the DAS and SIV and instructed to work independently. Squared Euclidian distance was utilized to compute value similarity and the total DAS score as a measure of marital satisfaction. The hypothesis presented is that couples who have greater similarity in values will report greater marital satisfaction, regardless of couple type. By utilizing correlational measures, ANOVA, MANOVA, and Tukey HSD Post Hoc analysis, at a chosen alpha level of .05, the hypothesis was not supported. White couples, however did report significantly higher marital satisfaction than did Interracial couples. Further analysis discovered that wives of White couples value Conformity significantly more than wives of Interracial couples. And lastly, wives of Interracial couples value Independence significantly more than wives of White couples. No significant findings with regard to Black couples was found.

Participants were between the ages of 20 and 45, and were biracial third, fourth, or a combination of third and fourth generation Japanese Americans. Half of the participants had a Japanese American mother and European American father, and half had a European American mother and Japanese American father. Research questions concerned: (a) how gender and ethnicity of each parent relates to the quality of the relationship with the biracial offspring; (b) how gender of the offspring relates to treatment received from each parent; (c) whether the relationship with each parent is associated with the participant's ethnic identity; and (d) whether the type of interracial parental dyad is associated with the parent/child relationship and ethnic identity of the offspring. Multiple 2-way and 3-way ANOVAs, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, and independent t-tests were used to analyze the data. Significant differences were found in how mothers and fathers treated their offspring, regardless of race. Participants reported that mothers showed more closeness-caregiving behaviors, separation anxiety, and emotional inter-reactivity toward their offspring than did fathers. Fathers showed more anger/aggression and more authority/dominance toward their offspring than did mothers. These findings highlight the influence of gender roles in family dynamics and seem similar to how parents of all racial groups in the U.S. treat their offspring. Significant correlations were found between respondents' racial appearance, their ethnic identity, and how they were treated by their parents. The more the offspring looked like and identified with their Japanese American parent, the more closeness-caregiving and controlling behaviors they reported receiving from their parents. Also, the more the participant looked like and identified with their European American parent, the more anxious and aggressive behaviors they reported receiving from their parents. Overall, some of the results of this study suggest that qualities of the parent/child relationship are associated with the offspring's physical features and ethnic identification. However, the small sample size (30 female and 13 male participants) makes this study exploratory only, and replication with larger samples is needed.

This perspective maintains that evidence for the continued ""social distance"" between blacks and whites can be quantified in measures of workplace contact. Racial perceptions in schools, churches and neighborhoods provide additional evidence for the contact theory of race relations. Stereotypic perceptions develop when people are unable or unwilling to obtain all the information needed to make accurate judgments about people or situations. Often, the absence of the ""total picture"" encourages people to fill in the blanks with little reflection. As a result, this lack of reflection engenders negative social predispositions, including feelings of hostility and bigotry toward blacks. To be effective in reducing racial attitudes among whites, interracial contact should take place within an equal social setting. Moreover, the contact must be sustained rather than temporary. Finally, interracial contact needs to be intimate and informal to be effective in reducing stereotypes. This research is significant in several respects. First the content of racial stereotypes has not been the subject of research for some time. Most research on stereotyping focuses upon the judgments individuals make when they have a limited amount of information about a hypothetical person, usually of a minority or ""out-group"" member in real-life situations. This study is exploratory in that it seeks to extend the literature on stereotypes in order to determine if increased interracial contact by whites will be associated with less-prejudiced persons. In order to test the hypothesis, a survey questionnaire was utilized to measure interracial contact and exposure. The research hypothesized that interracial contact by whites will be associated with positive racial attitudes and less exaggerated stereotypical perceptions. A self-report survey instrument on prejudice was administered to a sample of 135 personnel at the Northwest Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department substation. Preliminary findings suggest contact is a strong predictor of racial attitudes. The format of the dissertation follows the guidelines of the American Psychological Association.

Fourteen biracial college women participated in the study, which used multiple methodologies including the use of personal narratives, focus groups, and personal interviews. Results revealed that participants' identity choices did influence their choices and constructions of social contexts, particularly at the school they all attended. Yet while identification choices did influence participants' perceptions about their social contexts, other factors such as social barriers also influenced them. Family played a role in their identification choices as well, but siblings were found to be more influential than parents. In addition, results showed that educators and biracial mentors had a significant impact on participants. Implications of the findings for parents, educators and future researchers are discussed.

Biracial individuals, those with parents from two different socially designated racial backgrounds, face unique challenges in developing a racial identity. These include: negative or unwanted attention to their ""exotic"" physical appearance, and feelings of ambiguity regarding racial identity that may lead to difficulty with not only claiming a racial identity, but with the rejection of that identity by society. Existing research has not applied the emerging social science emphasis on the narrative study of lives to biracial identity development. The purpose of this study was to investigate how the application of a narrative framework of conceptualizing identity as a story increases understanding of the complexity and challenges of biracial identity development. Twenty subjects, 14 females and 6 males ages 18 and older, whose parents are of two different socially designated racial groups, were interviewed individually by the researcher. A semi-structured interview guide was developed specifically for this study to elicit a narrative of biracial identity development. Data were subjected to a qualitative analysis in which verbatim transcripts were produced and reviewed to identify relevant themes. Results indicate that a narrative framework offers an in-depth, detailed examination of the challenges and complexities of biracial identity development. Seventy-five percent of subjects were able to describe, at least somewhat, their racial identity development in the form of a story. Two major themes elicited from the narratives were subjects' views on issues relevant to their own racial identity formation, and issues common to the biracial experience. No statistically significant relationships between racial identification and selected categories were found due to the small sample size. In general, narratives progressed from a lack of awareness of race, to identifying racially, to distinguishing between race and ethnicity, to addressing ongoing issues related to ethnicity. Areas for further research include examination of interrelationships between categories, the relationship of racial identity to other salient identities, and expanding the age range of the sample to better explore racial identity development across the lifespan.

Black women exhibit a lower breast cancer incidence than White women, but their breast cancer mortality is higher. Causes for the racial difference are not known, but the higher breast cancer mortality has been linked to diagnosis at later stages of disease. A possible contributing factor to later stage at breast cancer diagnosis is inappropriate breast cancer screening. Adherence to appropriate breast cancer screening is especially important for women with family histories of breast cancer (FH+) as they are at increased risk for developing breast cancer and have been found to have a higher perception of personal risk for developing the disease and greater psychological distress, both have been linked to inappropriate screening. Evidence from studies with Hispanic women suggests also that level of acculturation plays a role in breast cancer screening. It was hypothesized that psychological factors and acculturation impacts on breast cancer screening. BSE frequency was selected as the breast cancer screening behavior as it is a low-cost behavior that has been found to increase the likelihood of detecting early breast tumors. The study was done in two parts. The first part compared Black women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer (FH+) to Black women without a first-degree relative with breast cancer (FH-) on measures of perception of risk, psychological distress (general, cancer-specific and BSE-specific) and breast self-examination (BSE) frequency (N = 100). The Groups differed on perception of risk, BSE-specific distress and short-term BSE frequency. BSE-specific distress mediated the relationship between family history of breast cancer and BSE frequency. When the FH+ and FH- Groups were combined, avoidance and intrusive thoughts were found to be related to BSE frequency. The second part of the study examined the effects African American acculturation on psychological distress and BSE frequency among a sub-sample (N = 67). Only the Preference for African American Things and Interracial Attitude sub-scales were related to BSE frequency. These sub-scales were unrelated to general or cancer-specific distress. The utility of African American acculturation in understanding BSE frequency and implications for breast cancer screening interventions are discussed.

The model allows distinctions to be made between racial identity and cultural identity. These distinctions comprise 16 proposed identities of transracial adoptees and are made up of the degrees to which individuals: (1) have knowledge of, awareness of, competence within, and comfort with their own racial group's culture, their parents' racial group's culture, and multiple cultures, and (2) are comfortable with their racial group membership and with those belonging to their own racial group, their parents' racial group, and multiple racial groups. These distinctions are comprised of dimensions: the Adoptee Culture Dimension, the Parental Culture Dimension, the Adoptee Race Dimension, and the Parental Race Dimension. The distinctions made by the model can aid in understanding the counseling needs of transracial adoptees as they are affected by the identification with racial groups other than their own. In this study, the Cultural-Racial Identity of transracial adoptees was determined using the Cultural-Racial Identity Questionnaire (CRIQ; as developed for this study) and a modified version of the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM; Phinney, 1992). Psychological adjustment was assessed by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis & Cleary, 1977) and self-esteem was assessed by Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (SES; Rosenberg, 1965). The sample consisted of 51 transracial adoptees who completed mail survey questionnaires. The exploratory findings supported the Cultural-Racial Identity Model by demonstrating that the modified version of the MEIM successfully yielded variation in the potential Cultural-Racial Identities that the transracial adoptees reported. Findings also did not yield support for differences in psychological adjustment among transracial adoptees having different Cultural-Racial Identities but findings did support a relationship where the Parental Race Dimension and the Adoptee Race Dimension predict the self-esteem of transracial adoptees. The implications that the results have for counseling practice and social policy were discussed.

Following the Inner Compass is an experiential research document using the researcher's selected dreams, visions, art, and psychic experiences over the course of the last thirty years to show the inner workings of the intuitive world. To quote Dissertation committee member Angeles Arrien Ph.D., ""This work represents 'the next step' in the development of intuition. When one reads these intuitive stories, it awakens our own intuitive world and gives us a direct experience of the intuitive."" (Committee meeting, December 15, 1997) The intuitive stories and dreams in this dissertation act as catalysts and ignite the readers to recall their own intuitive memories. The researcher uses intuitive art, Rudolf Steiner's seven year cycles of human biography (O'Neil, 1990), and the Experiential Method (Kidd & Kidd, 1990) as research methodologies in examining these intuitive processes. Another unique thread that is woven throughout the work is the dialogue between the indigenous and esoteric-Christian parts of the researcher who is of an interracial heritage composed of Hawaiian-Chinese, German, English, French and Irish. This dissertation is an attempt to show the workings of the inner Compass, that deep sense of knowing that can provide inner guidance. It is one woman's story of making a bridge between her external realities and her inner intuitive world. The basic assumption is that the inner work of a single individual contributes to the development of the consciousness of the collective.

The predominant perspective of the existing biracial literature is ecosystemic and has focused mainly on psychosocial factors. While these factors are important to consider, an area that has not been addressed in the literature is the contribution of the individual's unique psychology in racial identity. A qualitative study, of semi-structured interviews, was conducted with three psychotherapists who have worked with biracial individuals in insight-oriented treatments. Therapists were asked to talk about their work with one to two of their biracial patients and share their experiences and impressions of particular themes related to biracial identity, including psychosocial factors and psychological factors such as transference, countertransference, object-relations, intrapsychic conflicts, developmental issues, defensive style, and trauma. Four cases were discussed. The findings supported the literature's suggestion of the general influence of the following psychosocial factors on biracial identity: family, extended family, community, peers, school, personal cultural experiences, physiognomy, and historical and socio-political factors. Several other key psychosocial factors emerged that seemed to impact biracial identity formation including, criticism from others regarding culturally appropriate behaviors. The study explored and supported additional areas to consider in future research on biracial identity: (a) experiences with new family members through re-marriage; (b) roles of dating, partnering, spouse, and parent; (c) socio-economic status; (d) acculturation and assimilation; (e) language; (f) gender roles; and (g) media. The biracial persons' relationships with each of their parents, trauma, and how early life experiences are internalized and managed, including how these experiences shape object-relations, conflicts, and what defenses are employed, were shown to be psychological variables in this study that could have an impact on racial identification. Relationships beyond the family seemed to be ways in which the meaning of one's biracial heritage can be recapitulated. Object-relations theory was extended and applied to the process of racial identity formation. The limitations of this study, including its small sample size and its clinical population are discussed. Recommendations for future research and clinician implications for treating biracial persons are presented.

Those researchers who have elected to investigate race have found themselves faced with a host of fundamental and subtle problems of measurement. Techniques designed to assess racism have generally taken either of two forms: direct or indirect. To avoid the limitations of indirect measures, many researchers have focused their efforts on the direct assessment of behavior. One promising procedure to emerge from these efforts has been the dyadic interaction paradigm devised by Ickes (1984). Using Ickes' procedure as a guide, a recent study by the author (Durm, 1996) sought to examine the merits of a revised construct and revised assessment paradigm with regards to black-white interactions. The revised construct, referred to as ""receptivity"", consisted of the following response elements: eye contact, interpersonal distance, openness of body posture, positive affect, and engaging verbal responses. The study placed white female subjects in a waiting room scenario where they were given the opportunity to interact with either a black or white female confederate. Results indicated that subjects displayed more receptive behaviors when in the presence of the white confederate than when in the presence of the black confederate. The present study was an attempt to refine and expand the procedure developed in the initial investigation. To this end an examination of the convergence of the receptivity construct measures with other subtle and obvious measure of racism (i.e., the Modern Racism Scale, Student Racism scale, Right-Wing Authoritarian Scale, Social-Dominance Orientation Scale, and a memory procedure) was conducted. A cluster of three strong relationships emerged among the measures of eye contact, verbal engagement, and positive affect. A second cluster of three moderate relationships was noted between the weighted distance measure and eye contact, positive affect, and verbal engagement. Positive affect was the sole measure to consistently and strongly correlate with the survey measures. Between group differences failed to achieve statistical significance. Significant analysis is directed towards the difficult nature of studying racism and behavior through observation. Finally, several potential research directions are highlighted.

In three studies involving White participants, the last of which was conducted on the World Wide Web, the obstacles perceived to be faced by fictitious Black and White bank employees were manipulated through the use of affirmative-action or equal-opportunity hiring policies. As expected, Whites working under affirmative action were perceived to face greater obstacles to occupational success than Blacks, whereas Blacks working under equal opportunity were perceived to face greater obstacles than Whites. Supporting the role of attributional processes above and beyond the effects of sympathy or self-presentation, Black targets were rated more favorably than White targets primarily when the Black targets were perceived to face greater obstacles. Further suggesting an attributional process, only those personality domains that were causally related to occupational obstacles (i.e., Conscientiousness, Achievement Striving) were affected by the manipulations, and causal attributions for the employees job performance were found to mediate the ratings on these domains. Results also showed that minority-favoring evaluations were made primarily by participants who acknowledged anti-Black discrimination. Such participants also showed a pattern of attributions opposite of the ethnocentric attribution bias. However, no evidence was found for the contemporary criticism of affirmative action that it leads highly skilled beneficiaries to be perceived as incompetent or unambitious by White evaluators.

The sample for this study consisted of 118 randomly assigned freshman and sophomore African American-White residence hall roommate pairs (59 African American and 59 White) at The University of Georgia. Sixty-eight treatment group participants took part in a six-week small-group intervention, and 50 control group participants received no intervention. Participants ranged in age from 17 to 24, with the majority of the participants aged 18 (64%) and 19 (19%). Thirty-four of the participants were male, and 84 were female. ANCOVAs were conducted to investigate whether roommate pairs who participated in the structured small group intervention differed in roommate satisfaction, ethnic pride, and other-group orientation from roommate pairs who did not participate in the intervention, controlling for entering scores on cognitive flex, behavioral flex, and racial identity Results indicated no significant difference in roommate satisfaction, ethnic pride, and other-group, orientation across the interaction of time and condition. Results indicated differential relationships between the dependent variables and the covariates. One-way ANOVAS were conducted to investigate whether differences existed on roommate satisfaction among participants of the same race who differed in racial identity status. Results indicated no significant difference in roommate satisfaction among African American participants, and a significant difference among White participants. A qualitative short-answer question was analyzed using constant comparative analysis to assess the impact of participation in the small-group intervention on the roommate relationship. Seven categories emerged from the data: (1) greater communication within roommate pairs, (2) greater awareness of other cultural norms and values, (3) greater awareness of one's own cultural norms and values, (4) more general knowledge about roommate, (5) closer relationship with roommate, (6) opportunity to spend time together, and (7) no impact on roommate relationship. The implications of these findings in relation to program development and future research were discussed.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Internal Family Systems Therapy on the psychological issues related to biracial identity development. Method. A group of 5 biracial individuals ranging in age from 19-35 were recruited through advertisements in a university newspaper and flyers posted throughout the city where the study took place. Criteria for group membership were that one was the offspring of parents who were of two distinctly different ethnic backgrounds, e.g., Black/White, Asian/White, Hispanic/Black, etc. and did not have a serious mental disorder. Each member participated in a pre-screening interview prior to the beginning of the group to acquire demographic information, psychosocial history and to determine if they met the criteria for inclusion in the group. Internal Family Systems Therapy was used in an eight week, group therapy modality. Self reports and the therapist's observational reports were used as the method of identifying positive effects that Internal Family Systems Therapy had on issues related to biracial identity development. Results. The application of the therapeutic approach met the goals of treatment and effected a positive change on members of the group. Each member's journal writings revealed a greater sense of awareness of the issues they have faced in their biracial identity development and a relief from some of the symptoms manifested from the struggles of solidifying such an identity. Furthermore, the application of Internal Family Systems Therapy proved to be a viable approach in helping the group members achieve these results.

However, research and speculation regarding negative impact of these difficulties have been limited to couples in the early stages of their relationships. The current study examined the influence of constructive communication, partner and social support, and aspects of ethnic identity, as potential moderators of the relationship between experience with discrimination and relationship satisfaction in committed, longer-term African American/white interracial relationships. 20 African American/white interracial couples, 14 African American same-race couples, and 17 white same-race couples completed self-report measures of relationship satisfaction, relationship adjustment and communication, partner acceptance, social support and isolation, multicultural and ethnic identity, and experiences with discrimination. Results revealed that interracial couples are as adjusted and satisfied in their relationships with their partners and supports as couples who share the same racial and ethnic backgrounds. Although interracial couples were more likely to report experiences with covert discrimination than same-race couples, experiences of discrimination and social isolation were generally unrelated to relationship functioning in interracial relationships. Multiculturalism and ethnic pride were less central to relationship functioning for interracial couples, as compared to the more global support and acceptance provided by partners. No moderator effects were found. Overall, findings indicate that clinical assumptions regarding the inevitable unhappiness and distress in interracial relationships may be unfounded. The current study expands upon previous research through its examination of committed, longer-term interracial relationships, inclusion of appropriate comparison groups, utilization of standardized measures employed in couple research, and its integration of the stress and coping, racial and ethnic identification, and marital literatures.

Exp II employed 30 naive, white applicants (male university students) and 2 trained white interviewers. In this experiment Ss received behaviors that approximated those given either the black or white applicants in Exp I. Results indicate that Ss treated like the blacks of Exp I were judged to perform less adequately and to be more nervous in the interview situation than Ss treated like the whites. The former Ss also reciprocated with less proximate positions and rated the interviewers as being less adequate and friendly. Implications for black unemployment are discussed.

There was also an interaction of race and sex. African-American women were 84% less likely than African-American men to approve of transracial adoption. Compared with African-American men, Caucasian men were 72% less likely to approve.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Using the centrality of race within the context of romantic relationships, this study was designed to determine how race influences the communicative process. Q-sort methodology was used, which required 120 Ss to determine what waiting, hinting, direct, and third-party intervention strategies they would use to initiate a date in both same-race and interracial contexts. Findings reveal that when comparing verbal strategies across both contexts and open-ended responses to likelihood or reality of dating interracially, Ss were resistant to the idea of dating a person from another race. External factors, such as family and society, were cited as primary deterrents to involvement in an interracial romantic relationship. In general, Ss used more social distancing strategies for initiating interracial dating relationships than same-race dating relationships.

(2) What factors appear to be associated with the development of these identities? (3) Is the development of ethnic identity related to other aspects of the child's adjustment? 30 adoptive families, including their 40 South Korean children (aged 9-14 yrs), served as Ss. Multiple regression analysis shows that 2 factors are associated with the extent of ethnic identity in the children: their participation in Korean cultural activities and ease of communication between the children and their parents about the adoption. Between the ages of 4 and 6 yrs, the children began to recognize differences when they entered a new situation. Parents played an important role in exposing their children to Korean culture at this stage. Beginning about the age of 7, the children began to learn that ethnicity and facial structure would remain constant across time. They also were able to identify themselves as Korean. Between the ages of 9 and 11, children either accepted their differences or experienced a dissonance about their ethnic identity. Between the ages of 12 and 14, they began integrating Korean heritage and American culture.

The variable of ethnoracial awareness was operationalized as the families' identification of and recourse to a cultural consultant. The sample included couples and single parents residing in ICA families. Data collected on 37 families involved 51 ethnoracially different children. 29 adoptees among the 51 children had a cultural consultant, and precustodial visits were made on behalf of 76% of all ICAs. Of 37 families, 49% reported the presence of a cultural consultant for 1 or more of the ICAs in parental custody. Among the 18 families reporting the presence of a cultural consultant, 66% reported precustodial visits to the country of origin.

The history of interracial marriages in the US is examined, and the scientific and social theories that underlie the racial bigotry suffered by mixed people are discussed. Questions of racial identity, conflict, and self-esteem are addressed and treated as issues of mental health, and the struggle for acceptance in a black and white world and the racist abuses that many interracial people have suffered are discussed as well.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined cultural issues involved in financial disputes in Filipinas-Australian marriages. 481 Filipina residents of Queensland (mean age 41 yrs) completed questionnaires, with 139 Ss also completing interviews and 90 Ss participating in focus group discussions. Results show that decisions to migrate and marry Australian men were influenced by perceptions of the relative wealth of their future husband and their presumed enhanced ability to provide support for Filipino kin. Finances were a constant point of tension in many Filipina-Australian marriages because of unrealized financial expectations, issues related to the remittance of money to family in the Philippines, the husband's disapproval of his wife's participation in the paid workforce, and financial practices such as the management of the household finances. It is concluded that premigration financial counselling is important for both Filipinas and Australian men.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Using the results of 19 in-depth qualitative interviews and observations, the authors suggest that one interpersonal skill involved in maintaining successful interracial Black-White romantic relationships can be the management of public harassment. Specifically, this refers to the management of evaluative, hostile, and discriminatory actions and reactions that couples receive from strangers in public places. Informants (aged 21-40 yr olds) all living in the Midwest, suggested that, at the very least, a continuing interracial relationship must learn to deal with many forms of public harassment. Another theme from the reports of the informants concerned the variety of ways that public harassment was dealt with. The informants (1) reported that harassment behavior fell into the 3 main categories, (2) detailed the management strategies and attitudes they used to deal with harassment, and (3) indicated how important such public harassment was for the partner choice of interracial couples and, symbolically, for the society at large.

The present report, based on 1993 data, covers parental assessments when children were in their early 20s (mean age 23 yrs). This report compares 37 inracially adopted White young adults with 151 transracially adopted Asians, 33 African Americans, and 19 Latinos. Parental judgments and reports were used to assess problem behavior, and the Global Assessment Scale and an index of dysfunctionality were used to assess problematic adjustments. Comparisons show no significant adjustment deficits for the subgroups of transracial adoptees in comparison with their inracially adopted White peers. Adjustment problems vary considerably among the transracially adopted young adults; discrimination against the transracial adoptee, and discomfort about their appearance are found as significant correlates associated with adjustment difficulties. Parents report fewer adoptees feeling uneasy about their appearances, when adoptive families live in racially heterogeneous settings.

An upward trend of Asian intermarriage in the past 2 decades was not evident in the Canadian data. Multivariate analyses suggest the individual's achieved socioeconomic characteristics have become more critical in the process of interracial assortative mating over time. More specifically, educational and employment heterogamous couples are more likely to be intermarried, especially when the wife's achievement exceeds that of the husband's.

These are: (1) a one-dimensional structure in which racism is treated as a whole; (2) target-based factors in which racism towards 1 target group might be different than racism towards another target; and (3) function-based factors in which there are different aspects of racism towards a given target group. Ss were 282 18-45 yr old undergraduates at a large university in the Southwestern US. They completed a demographic questionnaire, and a racism survey with closed-end attitude questions targeting African Americans and Mexican Americans. The survey was based on M. L. Byrd's original racism scale, the Tolerance of Human Diversity Instrument (1993). Results suggest that a 3-factor solution provides the best explanation of the data, suggesting distinct but interrelated views towards intimate interracial relationships, towards social relationships, and towards macro-social/political phenomena. The results failed to support the authors' contention of ethnic/racial target-based racism. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

The hypothesis was tested that among migrants who are well established economically and socially within a new country, the perception of cultural conflict within marriage might override acculturation as a determinant of psychological well-being. Interviews were carried out with 23 relatively affluent Turkish men and 10 women who had been born in Turkey and had been resident in the UK for an average of 12.2 yrs, and with their British partners. A marital cultural difficulties index was constructed from ratings of problems stemming from cultural differences in 22 aspects of daily living. Depression, assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory, was correlated with marital cultural difficulties in both Turkish and British Ss, independently of sex, age and duration of marriage. Depression scores were higher among respondents who reported greater cultural conflict. The results highlight the implications of residual cultural conflict within mixed marriages for psychological well-being.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter explores the working-through process of the bad mother transference in combined individual and group treatment with all-female groups from an object relations perspective. Attention is paid to how the bad mother transference interacts with issues of race and ethnicity, and to ways of healing the defensive splitting that gives rise to the bad mother transference. B. P. Karon and A. J. Widener (1995) cite the work of M. Klein (1930, 1948) in their definition of splitting as an unconscious defense mechanism that the patient is unable to integrate both the good and bad introjects (images) of mother and/or of self. In relationships, when an individual engages in defensive splitting, the individual experiences other people and themselves as either all good or all bad. The realistic good and bad elements of both the self and others are not integrated and cannot be experienced simultaneously. Clinical vignettes are drawn from two groups in the author's private psychotherapy practice. Group 1, an interracial group, which began in 1984, was an all-female group. Men were integrated into the group beginning in 1991, the group's seventh year. Group 2 is an all-female group of African American women that began in 1992.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) As an increasing number of people of color have entered the ranks of mental health practitioners, the configuration of treatment dyads (and triads) has changed. Traditionally, White clinicians have treated most patients of any color. With the entry of greater numbers of therapists who are people of color, patients have begun to be treated by persons of a wider range of ethnic backgrounds. Furthermore, as African American clinicians credentialed in the 1970s through the 1980s matured in their careers, the complexion of senior clinicians, teachers, and supervisors changed. Thus, the potential in treatment for a variety of dynamic interactions and unconscious responses will develop in response to this experience of difference. The examination of this inter- and intraethnic experience in supervision is the focus of the chapter.

Children in an arctic community were tested in English, French and Inuttitut at the beginning and end of each of the first 3 school years. Compared with Inuit in heritage language and mixed-heritage children in a second language, Inuit in second-language classes (English or French) showed poorer heritage language skills and poorer second-language acquisition. Conversely, Inuit children in Inuttitut classes showed heritage language skills equal to or better than mixed-heritage children and Whites educated in their heritage languages. Findings support claims that early instruction exclusively in a societally dominant language can lead to subtractive bilingualism among minority-language children, and that heritage language education may reduce this subtractive process.

Participants were 200, predominately White, middle-class college students. Ss read a vignette depicting a domestic violence incident. Manipulated within the vignette were batterer race, victim race, and victim drinking. After reading the vignette, participants completed a questionnaire concerning their perceptions of the domestic assault. Results indicate batterers in interracial relationships are attributed more guilt than batterers in same-race relationships. In addition, when domestic violence victims drink alcoholic beverages before a domestic assault, more responsibility for the assault is attributed to Black victims than to their White counterparts. Results also revealed domestic violence victims who drink alcohol are ascribed more blame and derogation in comparison to abstinent domestic violence victims.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Modern racists are theorized to have negative affect and attitudes toward African Americans yet may be motivated to avoid appearing prejudiced. Thus, they may behave toward African Americans in covert ways. This hypothesis was tested using both an overt and covert measure of aggression in a competitive reaction-time task. Exp 1 (n = 87 university students) found that high modern racists were more overtly and covertly aggressive than were low modern racists, regardless of competitor race. In addition, high modern racists displayed a pattern of increasing covert aggression toward African Americans, whereas low modern racists inhibited retaliation even under high levels of provocation. Exp 2 (n = 78 university students) replicated Exp 1 and provided evidence suggesting that covert aggression is a strategic process that cannot be employed under conditions of reduced cognitive capacity. Covert aggression, along with other covert behaviors, is seen as highlighting differences between high and low modern racists.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"There is considerable controversy regarding the means by which bisexual and biracial individuals achieve a sense of identity. In this paper, the concepts of bisexual and biracial identity are reviewed, and the literature on identity developmental models are critiqued. Further, a qualitative study is presented that explored the complexity of biracial identity development in 15 20-40 yr old Japanese-Americans. Ss explored identity options attempting to develop their own meaning of identity, to develop a confident sense of themselves and secure a positive ethnic identity. Based on research and dialogue, there appears to be parallels between bisexual and biracial identity development. A model is proposed that suggests that individuals who are bisexual or biracial go through four phases in their development of their positive identity. These phases are: Phase I-Questioning/Confusion; Phase II-Refusal/Suppression; Phase III-Infusion/Exploration; and Phase IV-Resolution/Acceptance. These phases describe people who have two distinct identities that place them in a position of self-devaluation. From there they move to a position where there is a positive perception of identity based on the coexistence of their identities.

The model accounts for heterogeneity within groups defined by their racially integrated families. It allows distinctions to be made between racial identity and cultural identity. These distinctions comprise 16 identities of transracial adoptees and are made up of the degrees to which individuals have knowledge of, awareness of, competence within, and comfort with their own racial group's culture. Additionally, the model holds that parents' racial group's culture, and multiple cultures play a role, as well as the degree to which children are comfortable with their racial group membership and with individuals belonging to their own racial group, their parents' racial group, and multiple racial groups.

Foreign adoption is often accompanied by complex problems, including reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and other serious health problems. The continuation of RAD in adulthood results in feelings of psychic homelessness. Dutch parents of 30 foreign-born adopted children that had been subsequently placed into residential care completed the Child Behavior Checklist (T. M. Achenbach and C. S. Edelbrock, 1983) (CBCL), and 40 adoptees (aged 15-20 yrs) in residential care completed a related questionnaire, the Youth Self- Report. As well, 2,148 adoptive parents with children not in residential care and a large group of 10-15 yr old adopted children completed the CBCL. Results show that nonadopted children, adopted boys, and those aged 12-15 yrs displayed more stealing, lying, cheating, vandalism, and other antisocial behaviors compared to controls. Adopted girls aged 12-15 yrs displayed higher scores related to cruel and aggressive behavior.

The authors used sociograms to analyze students' ""work-with"" ""sit-near,"" and ""play-with"" interaction choices. Findings suggested the following: (1) Black students appeared less willing than White students to interact. (2) Racial considerations seemed more pronounced among girls than among boys. (3) Black female students were the most reluctant group to interact across racial lines. (4) No trend toward higher percentages of students choosing to mix across racial lines was detected.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Intermarriage is one of the most salient demographic features of Hawaii. Between 1983 and 1994, 46% of all marriages contracted in Hawaii were racially exogamous. Over 80% of these intermarriages were formed among 4 major ethnic groups in the islands: Caucasians, Japanese, Filipinos and Hawaiians. This paper examines socioeconomic status exchange in outgroup marriage. Status homogamy emerges as the most important pattern of mate selection. In a broad sense, people choose their mate on the basis of equal socioeconomic status, either within or across boundaries of race and ethnicity. Gender differences are very small, indicating that status is equally important for both men and women in choosing a marital partner. However, these patterns suggest that groups of very high and very low status have a very restricted marriage market. Continued intermarriage also raises questions about how to measure race and ethnicity in the islands.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the prevalence and correlates of belief in conspiracy theories among African Americans in Louisiana. Correlates examined were beliefs related to guns, miseducation of Blacks, government promotion of drug use, police harassment, government information about AIDS, criminal justice system bias, government surveillance of Black organizations, and genocide (AIDS, family planning, interracial adoption, needle distribution). Overall results, based on survey responses of 1,104 parishioners of 35 churches, show a strong belief in most conspiracy theories involving government. Over 85% agreed or strongly agreed that African Americans are harassed by police because of their race and that the criminal justice system is not fair to Blacks. The least supported theories involved transracial adoption, family planning, and needle-exchange programs as genocide. Benign theories were more prevalent than malicious intent theories. Church attendance was not significantly related to support for malicious intent theories, whereas it was negatively related to support for benign theories. It is concluded that those who believed that Blacks could influence the political process were less likely to believe in conspiracy theories.

Does this mean that eliminativism is correct? The author argues that it does not, and that, however admirably motivated, eliminativist approaches have failed to recognize more subtle ways in which divisions into races might have biological significance. Further, some of the ways in which concepts of race figure in social discussions are explored, indicating questions that would have to be resolved if the practice of discarding racial divisions were lead to desirable conclusions.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Televised role portrayals and interracial interactions, as sources of vicarious experience, contribute to the development of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination among children. The 1st section of this article reviews the amount and nature of racial/ethnic content on television, including limited portrayals of racial/ethnic groups and of interracial/ethnic interaction. The 2nd section focuses on theoretical models that help explain television's role in the development, maintenance, and modification of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. The 3rd section addresses research on the effects of television in altering stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination, with particular attention given to media intervention programs specifically designed to address these issues ( Sesame Street and Different and the Same).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Identifies organizational structures and practices in schools that influence the frequency of interracial interactions, the likelihood of cross-race friendships, and students' attitudes and behaviors toward members of different racial and ethnic groups. These formal and informal organizational practices include curriculum tracking, assignment to classes, attendance at school level functions, and extracurricular activities. The article discusses how the quality of interracial interactions and the resulting relationships among students is influenced by the contexts of these different organizational practices, including students' status expectations, cooperative vs competitive modes of academic and extracurricular interactions, and educators' views on racial/ethnic issues and their preferences for instructional methods. It is suggested that by taking these effects into account, schools can make significant advances in promoting positive race relations.

The possible environmental factors to be investigated included location of the high schools (urban and suburban), and parents attitudes and beliefs regarding race relations with people who may be culturally different. The possibility that interracial friendships and dating choices are the result of a developmental stage adolescents go through was also explored. This study used the original Eriksonian theory as a basic foundation to examine the ego development of high school students to measure their different ego identity statuses as postured by G. Adams, L. Bennion, and K. Huh (1989), and determine if a relationship exists between their cognitive growth and the number of interracial friendships students have. A 192-item survey of background variables, interpersonal attitudes, experiences and choices was developed by P. Christian-Kliger and E. Mayfield-Fleming to ascertain contemporary perspectives on interracial perceptions of dating and friendships, the personal attitudes or motives that support or reject these perceptions of interracial dating and friendship patterns, and the reasons people use to rationalize their friendships and dating choices. A 64-item Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status developed by G. Adams, L. Bennion, and K. Huh (1989) was used to measure the cognitive growth of these students. The results showed the following findings: (1) urban students have more interracial friendships than suburban students; (2) high school students show more diverse patterns in friendships based on their positive attitudes about interracial relationships, but not when it comes to the frequency of them dating interracially; (3) urban and suburban students' perceptions of more tolerant parental attitudes towards other racial groups did correlate with the students' positive attitudes concerning interracial friendships but did not correlate with parents' attitudes about dating; (4) age did not predict ego identity status in the study, hypothesis could not be tested because no students achieved ego identity achieved status in the study; (5) in urban and suburban communities used in the study, perceptions of parental attitudes towards other racial groups were related to their children's attitudes for Marcia's foreclosed identity status and for ego identity diffused status as well. When parents' and students' attitudes were correlated with moratorium, students' attitudes correlated with mothers' attitudes but not with fathers'; (6) no significance was found either in the number of friendships or frequency of dating partners with students classified as ego identity achieved or moratorium and ego identity foreclosed or diffused when correlated with the number of interracial friendships and dating partners. Ego identity status did not make a difference when choosing friends or dating partners.

The nine female and six male research participants who volunteered to participate in this study were predominantly from the capital of Suriname, Paramaribo. The participants had two to six different ethnic/racial backgrounds that were representative of all the major groups in Suriname (i.e., Amerindian, Chinese, Creole/African, White, Hindustani, and Javanese). The interview questions were based on Root's Ecological Model of Racial Identity Development (1997) and explored the relationship between macro-level contextual factors (i.e., class, gender, and regional race relations) as well as micro-level contextual factors (i.e., generation), social interactions within the community, family influences, and individual traits. A macro-level outer lens was also added to this model to investigate the impact that dominant cultural values regarding vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism had on the construction of gender, class, and race. These concepts were quantitatively measured by a modified version of a scale designed by Singelis, Triandis, Bhawuk, and Gelfand (1995) and supplemented the interview data. The interview and survey data that were provided by the participants revealed that horizontal and vertical concepts of self seemed to have a differential effect on race relations. The participants, who were mostly horizontally collectivistic and individualistic, believed that their cultural beliefs were reflective of a majority group in Suriname that was multiracial and multicultural, and that was continuously expanding its in-group boundaries. The male participants, who tended to have higher scores on the vertical scales and lower scales on the horizontal scales compared to the female participants, experienced more multiracial conflict (i.e., marginalization, pressure to choose) when interacting with ""traditional"" people from ethnic and racial groups with a predominantly vertical and collectivistic orientation (i.e., Hindustanis and Chinese), were more likely to rank their cultural values, and more prone to dichotomize their groups of affiliation. Although White supremacy ideologies and Eurocentrism were also significant factors that influenced race relations, the inherent cultural values of the local ethnic groups appeared to play an equally significant role.

Consequently, the purpose of this correlational study is two-fold: (a) to examine the personal, familial and community influences on racial identification choice among biracial adults; and (b) to examine the relationship between biracial participants' racial identification choice and well-being. The sample was composed of 86 adults who had a biological parent who was from a racial/ethnic minority group and a biological parent who was white. Participants were recruited through a web page advertisement on the internet, and they completed a questionnaire which was linked to this page. The results showed some support for most of the main research hypotheses. More specifically, participants' perceptions of physical similarity to biracial people were significantly higher among synthesizers as compared to other racial identification groups. Synthesizers had higher scores on items that assessed their degree of knowledge to their white parent's familial and historical culture as compared to minority identifiers. In addition, perceived physical resemblance to their minority parent's racial/ethnic group, degree of knowledge to minority familial and historical culture, contact with white people and male gender accounted for 36 percent of the explained variance in majority group racial identification. Contact with whites accounted for 20 percent of the variance in minority group racial identification. Perceived physical resemblance to whites accounted for 16 percent of the variance in disaffiliate racial identification. Contact with whites and female gender accounted for 15 percent of the variance in synthesizer racial identification. Perceived physical resemblance to whites and to biracial people, female gender, and age accounted for 42 percent of the variance in well-being. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that personal, familial and community factors significantly influence racial identification choice among biracial adults. Moreover, personal factors and demographic variables significantly predict positive psychological well-being among this group. Future research in this area should continue to refine the new measures and internet methodology to further specify sociocultural variables that are essential in promoting healthy racial identity among biracial people.

Situation comedy writing offers an ideal opportunity to examine the creative process of a group as it transpires. This case study explores the creative decision-making process in the development of one episode of a half hour network interracially themed situation comedy television script from conception through final production. The qualitative study was designed to understand (a) Management including organizational climate and management style, (b) Creative factors and practical and logistical variables that influenced writing decisions, (c) Group dynamics including interpersonal and intrapersonal factors, and (d) Factors that encouraged or discouraged conditions for creativity. Executive Producers and the writer of the episode were interviewed throughout the process. All written materials were reviewed as well as audio tapes of story conferences. Observations of the reading, run-throughs and final taping were made. This episode was particularly interesting because one of the stories was based on interracial relations and the writer was African American while the Executive Producers were white. A clear contrast in creative decision-making was illustrated between the two stories in this episode. One plot quickly selected was a predictable father-son with a standard resolution. A second story about racial harassment was much riskier because it didn't provide a ready-made resolution. Positive conditions for creative collaboration included a safe atmosphere where members of the group built upon each others ideas and a corporate climate where staff members felt free from studio and network interference. A negative condition was the unwillingness of the Owners to delegate and their proclivity to demand massive rewrites which generated fear of change, fatigue and resulted in less than maximum effort. Another negative was the relationship between the Executive Producers and the writer which included unaddressed disagreements about content and underlying communication style. Unwillingness to resolve this conflict diluted focus and distorted reactions resulting in an avoidance paradox. Implications for lessening the impact of creative differences are suggested including developing clear managerial policy for delegation of authority, timely decision-making and handling sensitive inter cultural and inter gender issues.

Theories of White racial identity, contextual experiences and interracial contact are highlighted as they pertain to White Mennonites' racial perceptions. It was hypothesized that White Mennonites experiencing meaningful interracial contacts in different contextual settings would exhibit more positive racial perceptions than other White Mennonites. Hypothesis testing occurred in conjunction with validation of the researcher's Scale of White Racial Attitudes-Mennonite Version. Following item, exploratory and confirmatory analyses, three dimensions resulted: Assumptions about Racial Minority Group Differences, Attitudes Toward Racial Minority Issues, and Personal Feelings About Racial Minority Groups. Repeated-measures ANOVAs supported the hypotheses and yielded significant interactional effects for racial perceptions with age, education, residence, Mennonite status and interracial contacts. Implications for White Mennonites and race relations, as well as possible implications for White Americans as a whole, are discussed.

Theories of Urie Bronfenbrenner, D. W. Winnicott, Erik Erikson and Stuart Hall frame the research. Within the ecological perspective of environmental psychology, the experience of these parents is seen at multiple levels and the interpretation of the results draws on object relations approaches of psychoanalysis and social constructionist approaches of cultural studies. Intensive case studies were conducted with 26 parents who adopted children internationally, using multiple research methods including a series of in-depth interviews, home visits, behavioral observations, participant observation, reporting of critical incidents and photographing of cultural objects that represented the birth culture of the child. This research found that parents constructed multiple identities, including the identity of parent, the identity of adoptive parent and the identity of internationally adoptive parent. For some parents, these identities also interacted with other identities, including gender, ethnic/national identity, religious affiliation, sexual preference, national origin, family-of-origin relationships, and urban vs. rural identification. Respondents exhibited a range of identifications with the child's birth culture, from mild to strong. Parents used a variety of ""transitional objects"" to relate to the child's birth culture, including physical objects, people, places and cultural phenomena. Some parents were already identified with certain birth cultures and chose to adopt children from those birthplaces that reflected these identifications; other parents adopted for more ""practical reasons"" and constructed their identities during and after the adoption. In general, parents whose children most resembled them in appearance were less likely to identify with the birth culture; those parents who had identified with the birth culture prior to adoption and/or whose children were most different from them in appearance were more likely to identify with the birth culture and use more cultural practices that connected them to the birth culture. The results of this research highlighted the social construction of perceived racial differences between adoptive parent, adopted child and US culture. It also explored the influence of ""consumerism"" on identity development. The research further demonstrated the use of an ecological model to understand identity issues in person-environment transactions.

This study explored several aspects of multiracial identity. First, within a college population 159 surveys were administered to students between the ages of 18 and 36 to explore the relationship between one's personal ethnic identity and that of one's ancestors. Over seventeen percent of respondents reported having at least one relative in the last four generations who was described as racially different than other relatives. Only a third of these respondents identified themselves as multiracial. Biracial people who identified themselves as monoracial despite having parents of two different racial groups were interviewed to understand the process of their identity formation. Five of the sixteen people interviewed identified monoracially. Most of those who identified monoracially (all identified with their nonWhite reference group) stated that affiliating themselves with their nonWhite culture was siding with the ""right"" side given the history of oppression in this country against people of color. Other reasons included contact with only one parent, and greater simplicity in reporting status. Second, multiracial participants were interviewed to ascertain the ways in which they came to terms with their racial and ethnic identities. Root's (1996) description of four coping mechanisms were tested. While at least a few examples were found to support all of Root's proposed constructs, participants were most likely to identify as either monoracial or multiracial. Interviews were conducted with sixteen people to attempt to understand the influences on ethnic and racial identity formation. Family appeared to be the largest contributor to ethnic-racial identity development among biracial individuals. Other important influences included peers, messages specific to ethnic and racial identity, community, school, history, language, and phenotype. Limitations to this study were related to sampling. Geographical diversity of participants was lacking, and their were large age differences between respondents. Also, participants had relatively high levels of education. Responses by participants may have also been affected by demand characteristics of the interview process. Further research could address limitations and build upon the findings of the current study.

Many adoptive families struggle with dissimilarities and disparities as they form a new family, consequently the use of social services beyond the finalization of the adoption has become more common. The problem lies with where adoptive families can turn to for help. Adoptive families have expressed that the mental health community is unfamiliar with issues relating to older child adoption, cross cultural and cross racial adoptions and how forming a family through adoption is a lifelong process. The purpose of this research, was to develop a program suitable for children adopted when older that are also classified as interracially or transculturally adopted and are now displaying externalizing behaviors. The program is referred to as MTPAST, or Multisystemic Theory of Post Adoption Services and Treatment. Every attempt was made to design a unique post adoption program. This program is based on Coelho's (1998) Attachment Guided Multisystemic Theory and incorporates many of the suggested strategies. The target population includes children adopted after the age of 1 year that are now between the ages of 8 to 10, children that were transracially or cross-culturally adopted and that are currently displaying acting out and externalizing behaviors. The program's goals were to promote secure relationships and attachment solidification in adoptive families through structural change. Program objectives were to decrease probability of developing future conduct problems and delinquent behaviors for adopted children currently displaying externalizing behaviors. The philosophy of the program was based on a multisystemic model combining attachment theory With a family systems model to promote healthier family functioning. The details of the program were based on Coelho's (1998) Attachment Guided Multisystemic Therapy model for children at high risk for developing conduct problems and delinquent behaviors. Some of the modifications include incorporating specific treatment issues for work with adoptive families, processing termination issues during the first family contact, grief work for all adoptive family members, use of a genogram and eco map, and providing an educational and mental health professional training component. Project MTPAST includes admission and exclusion criteria, and a means of assessing the progress of each adopted child. An evaluation, budget and sources of funding were also proposed as a guide, were the design to be implemented. Overall, it is believed that, by educating adoptive families and mental health professionals, Project MTPAST would benefit adoptive families having difficulties with their adopted children to achieve healthy integration and growth.

Although research on this growing population has been limited, previous findings have underscored the salience of racial/ethnic identity and the richness of qualitative methodologies in capturing participants' meanings. Sixteen interracially married couples served as participants. Each couple consisted of one Caucasian spouse and one spouse from a racial/ethnic minority group. Participants were very diverse with regard to racial/ethnic background, age, socioeconomic status, and length of marriage. Each couple participated in an in-depth, semistructured interview. In addition, nine spouses participated in an optional focus group. Areas assessed included premarital levels of racial/ethnic identification and fluctuations over the course of the relationship, perceived relational effects of cultural differences, styles of communication about racial issues, modes of cultural expression within the relationship, and unique benefits of interracial marriage. All interviews and the focus group, as well as extensive self-reflexive journal entries, were audiotaped and transcribed. Data analysis involved a process of continual inductive-deductive movement which incorporated components of grounded theory and heuristic inquiry. Overall results found that interracial couples' self-perceptions of their relationships were not centered around race. The racial/cultural components of individual spouses' psychological identities were not salient in most cases. The role of culture and the extent of cultural expression within their relationships, therefore, were minimal. Instead, most interracial couples in the present study considered their relationships to be quite similar to relationships of any racial composition. Their differences seemed insignificant, and they certainly were not viewed as sources of conflict. Many participants, however, were aware of culturally influenced behaviors which they shared in their relationships. Such sharing promoted the cultural learning and interpersonal growth viewed by many participants as the most special benefits of interracial marriage. These findings portray interracial couples quite differently than history and social science might predict. The importance of checking assumptions and addressing biases about this population is therefore emphasized. Implications for future research and for mental-health professionals are discussed.

The individuals who enter these marriages face the unique challenge of integrating separate ethnic cultures in a society that struggles with difference. Prior research has focused on the sociocultural factors that affect these interracial marriages and has hypothesized regarding their putative differences compared with intraracial marriages. The present study investigated tolerance of ambiguity and its impact on the marital satisfaction of Chinese Euro-American interracial marriages. The sample consisted of 71 participants who were married within the last eight years in Chinese Euro-American interracial Marriages. Most participants were recruited from the marital records data base at the San Francisco City Recorder's Office. Participants completed two measures, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Spanier, 1976) and the Multiple Stimulus Types Ambiguity Tolerance (McClain, 1993), as wen as a demographic questionnaire that was mailed to them. The design of the study was correlational and nonexperimental. The predictor variable was Tolerance of Ambiguity and the dependent variable was Marital Satisfaction. There was one main research hypothesis and three secondary hypotheses within this study. All four hypotheses were tested using Pearson product-moment correlation. The main research hypothesis predicted a positive linear correlation between the predictor variable, Tolerance of Ambiguity, and the dependent variable, Marital Satisfaction. This hypothesis was not confirmed. Two of the secondary hypotheses predicted positive linear correlations between the predictor variable, Tolerance of Ambiguity, and the dependent variables, Marital Consensus and Marital Cohesion. The third secondary hypothesis predicted a negative linear correlation between the predictor variable, Tolerance of Ambiguity, and the dependent variable, Marital Distress. None of these hypotheses were confirmed. Implications of these findings for marital satisfaction in Chinese Euro-American marriages and suggestions for future research were discussed. Qualitative findings suggested that Chinese Euro-American intermarried individuals tended to marry at a later age, have fewer children and have a higher socioeconomic status than the general population. The majority of participants reported that they had good relationships with their own families and their in-laws. When cultural conflicts were reported, they were based in differences over traditional expectations of gender roles, pressures to have children, and the degree of extended family involvement. No evidence was found to confirm a relationship between the similarity in spousal levels of acculturation and their marital satisfaction.

Racial identity was the dependent variable, and psychological functioning, coping processes and gender were the independent variables. No significant differences in the psychological functioning and the coping processes emerged among four racial identity outcome groups. No significant gender differences were found. However, in supplementary analyses, a one-way analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in coping process between two of four racial identity outcome groups. Consequently, the results did not contradict racial identity theory, which has suggested that there is not a direct relation between racial identity and psychological functioning. The findings suggest that racial identity may be related to some aspect of coping process.

The specific pattern explored concerns societal pressure on individuals to stay within the boundaries of their racial group. This trend teaches White Americans in particular to conform to social rules, one of which is to maintain social distance from people of color. This study explores whether racial identity, or individual differences in psychological orientation to race, might lead to different patterns of social distance. Specifically, White racial identity (Helms, 1984, 1990) includes six racial identity development ""statuses"" for Whites: Phase I statuses that include: Contact (naive about race), Disintegration (conflicted about the salience of race), Reintegration (pro-White/anti-Black); and Phase 2 statuses that include Pseudo-Independence (intellectual understanding of racial difference), Immersion-Emersion (exploration of one's racial heritage), and Autonomy (emotional and intellectual acceptance of race). Three hypotheses examine the relationship between social distance and White racial identity: (1) Phase 1 statuses will predict social distance towards twenty racial/ethnic groups while Phase 2 statuses will predict social intimacy, (2) Phase 1 statuses will predict social distance towards Black Americans, while Phase 2 statuses will predict social intimacy towards Black Americans, and (3) Phase 1 statuses will predict discriminatory behaviors in interracial social scenarios, while Phase 2 statuses will predict nondiscriminatory behavioral options. The subjects were 218 White Americans who completed a questionnaire packet that included: Personal Data Sheet; The White Racial Identity Attitude Scale (Helms & Carter, 1990); The Social Scenarios Scale (Byrnes & Kiger, 1988); The Social Distance Scale (Triandis & Triandis, 1960); and The Social Survey (modified by present author). The results suggest partial support for the hypotheses that White racial identity attitudes will predict social distance for racial/ethnic groups. The results also suggest partial support for the hypothesis that White racial identity attitudes will predict perceptions of behavioral options in interracial social scenarios. The study has implications for the counseling psychology profession as it considers how social distance influences clinical practice, policy, and training.

The primary questions asked of participants included: What life experiences have been influential in the decision to assert a biracial label and identity? What difficulties or challenges were encountered in the process of maintaining a positive biracial identity? What are the perceived benefits of being biracial? And what are the sources of strength that have helped in maintaining a positive biracial identity? This study employed a qualitative research design, utilizing a life narrative approach. Focused, in-depth interviews were conducted with twelve biracial individuals who had one socially designated Black parent and one socially designated White parent. Sensitizing concepts (Blumer, 1969) were used as a way to frame the study, analyze the data, and generate themes regarding the ways in which some biracial individuals come to assert a positive biracial identity. The racial identity development of the twelve individuals who participated in this study was found to be an ongoing, multidimensional process that was strongly affected by the psychosocial context of each individual's life. The most significant components of identity development discussed by all of the participants involved the experience of difference and the process of coming to terms with that difference through connection with other people. Participants relied on positive connections with family and sought affiliation with accepting others as they encountered difficulties associated with societal perceptions of what it means to be biracial. As they were able to validate and assert their biracial identities, participants felt increasingly positive about their heritage and were able to maintain a healthy sense of self that incorporated both sides. Participants indicted that affiliation with other interracial families and biracial peers was extremely valuable and reaffirming. These findings are consistent with Erikson (1950, 1959, 1968) who stressed the need for individuals to see themselves reflected in and validated by others. In addition, the process of racial identity development that occurred among the participants in this study was consistent with the model outlined by Kich (1992). This study showed that for these 12 individuals, regardless of the challenges they faced, the attainment of a healthy biracial identity was possible given the freedom to define themselves and assert their identification with both sides of their heritage.

Critical issues such as; the degree and quality of involvement that is maintained with one's culture and heritage, and the ways of responding to, and dealing with, a second culture emerge upon migration. Intercultural marriage (Rohrlich, 1988), the marriage where partners are of differing ethnic origins, has been associated with the process of second culture acquisition. It has been visualized as an indicator of minority assimilation and weakening of the cohesion of an ethnic group (Murguia, 1982). Marrying outside one's ethnic group could imply a loss of connection to the native culture, which encourages the person to move more rapidly toward the majority culture. Using a qualitative-descriptive design, data was gathered through in-depth interviews with five interculturally married migrant Puerto Rican women. Data from this study revealed that these women see themselves as competent, assertive, mature, and strong women who are culturally different from their North American counterparts. The women indicated that they constantly draw coping strategies and behaviors from two different cultural contexts (Puerto Rican/North American) and that they feel effective and competent within the majority culture because they have achieved a sense of internal balance where decision making and survival strategies are bicultural. Nevertheless, they feel restrained when they express some feelings and ideas in the presence of North Americans. They also sustain a sense of not belonging in the American culture. Women indicated that they need to feel connected in one way or another to their primary culture. Besides other aspects of connection to the Puerto Rican culture; e.g. the use of Spanish, perpetuation of familism, maintenance of friendships with compatriots, listening and dancing to Hispanic music, and cooking Puerto Rican food, some women reported a metaphysical dimension of connection. Suggested areas of disconnection from the primary culture were related to rebellion towards values that perpetuate parental and male preponderance. Findings indicated that women validate their opposition to these values (disconnection) within the context of their intercultural marriages. The use of some nonverbal behaviors, the relationship with the in-laws, different views in parenting, time and financial planning emerged as areas of marital conflict. Implications for research and practice were discussed.

Interview responses indicate that adopted college students feel freed up to ask themselves question about their history and open up to other who were adopted as a way of sharing common experiences and expanding levels of understanding. Many feel that, due to their experience of being adopted, they bring to the college experience an enhanced capacity to rely on themselves and think independently as well as to be open to new ideas and diversity. They reported that finding other adopted students is a cathartic experience that provides a bridge of intersubjective understanding. None of the students described an affinity with an extended family member.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the public's attitudes about racial-ethnic humor, especially that which demeans or insults a particular group. Responses by 727 Black and White Georgia residents to survey items on ethnic humor in general and their feelings about a well publicized controversial case of racial humor (the Ted Danson incident) were analyzed. Results indicated that, while there were some interracial differences, Black and White attitudes were not polarized, and more marked differences emerged when data were examined in race and sex categories. Sentiments on ethnic humor correlated weakly with SES and demographic variables, and could not be predicted from indicators of liberal conservative attitudes. Ethnic humor sentiments, however, were related to attitudes toward changing the official flag of Georgia: those in favor of removing the Confederate symbol on the state flag held more negative attitudes towards ethnic humor.

It was hypothesized that the proportion of securely attached Ss would be significantly greater than insecurely attached Ss; that securely attached Ss would display greater accommodative tendencies; and the difference between securely and insecurely attached Ss's accommodative tendencies would be more pronounced for destructive vs constructive responses to accommodative dilemmas. Consistent with the hypotheses, there was a significantly higher proportion of secure over insecure individuals among both sexes. Further, the difference between secure and insecure individuals' accommodative tendencies was greater for destructive responses than for constructive responses (significant among men, marginally significant among women). However, contrary to hypotheses, attachment style per se was not a significant predictor of accommodation responses among either sex.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article applies a cultural perspective in considering the opposition of some African-Americans to transracial adoption. The article presents a historical review of the transracial adoption controversy, detailing the arguments that have been presented in opposition and the legislation that has evolved. Symbolic interactionism is used to frame African-Americans as a unique and distinct cultural group, in which the socialization of African-American children takes place. The framework presented encompasses the meaning of children, family, and adoption to people of African descent, the racial and ethnic group as the context within which definitions of self and identity develop, and the efforts made in seeking to balance the integrity of concepts. Finally, the author recommends that social workers develop a research agenda that maintains but critically analyzes the role of African-American group identity for framing research for assessing child maltreatment within the context of poverty and resource deficiencies rather than personal failures and for advocating public policies that preserve cultural realities.

The level of interracial marriage was related inversely to the size of the racial group and to the proportion of the racial group in each region. Demographic structure, however, did not fully explain the racial differences in interracial marriage. Hispanics and Asian Americans had higher levels of interracial marriage than African Americans, despite greater prevalence of immigrants in the former 2 groups. Interracial marriage differed by educational attainment for each racial group, but spousal educational differences were similar among different types of interracial marriages. Findings suggest that racial differences in interracial marriage by educational attainment do not show that interracial marriage is an exchange of Whites' racial status for minorities' higher educational attainment, but indicate racial differences in educational attainment. Also, immigration status, an indication of acculturation, shows different effects on interracial marriage for each racial group.

A sample of convenience including two African-American, two European-American, and two biracial couples (aged 24-47) was used in this study. There were three parts to the research process. First, demographic information was collected using a standard questionnaire. Then the researchers asked the couple to jointly tell the story of their relationship from their initial meeting to their current experience. Finally, spouses were asked individually to respond to a question regarding his or her meanings for marriage. Findings suggest that the three groups of couples held a positive view of marriage. However, the two African-American couples simultaneously held negative meanings of marriage. In regard to the experience of marriage, results suggest that the tensions expressed by the African-American and European-American couples were quite similar. The problems centered on issues related to the internal dynamics of the couple. In contrast, the biracial couples experienced tensions related to the intrusiveness of friends and family, which they described as external to the relationship.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) Explores how family communication influences the topic of race. The editors argue that the hope for managing America's troubles with ""race"" lies not only with communicating about race at public meetings, in school, and in the media, but also with families communicating constructively about race at home. The authors in this book investigate such topics as how Black families communicate to manage the issue of racism; how Black parent-child communication is used to manage the derogation of Black children; the role of television in family communication about race; the similarities and differences between communication in Black, White, and biracial couples and families; and how family communication education can contribute to a brighter future for all. With the aim of developing a clearer understanding of the role that family communication plays in society's move toward a multicultural world, this volume provides a crucial examination of how families struggle with issues of ethnic cultural diversity.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The study of negotiation has been dominated by laboratory studies. These investigate research questions arising from an economics-oriented paradigm, leading researchers to exclude many variables that impact negotiations. Emotion is one such variable. Anger, in particular, determines the intensity of the conflict between the negotiators, is both a cause and an effect of the process by which the negotiators try to reach agreement, and impacts the implementation of the settlement. Insights from clinical psychology supplement and enrich those available from social psychology, economics, and cognitive psychology. The importance of emotion is illustrated by examining interracial conflicts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper examines extended narrative accounts from 6 women elders (aged 59-95 yrs) in the African American community to investigate why physical discipline (PD) as a parenting style is preferred in this community and how it is ideally to be used. The narrative data show extensive intergenerational support for the use of PD. The women delineated a clear distinction between the use of PD and child abuse and definite guidelines that must be followed when using PD. For the mothers and grandmothers in this study, the use of PD was an integral part of child rearing. In their view the attempt to raise children entirely on the basis of verbal reasoning is much more likely to lead to abuse than PD. Even when PD is occasionally excessive, it is generally not seen as harmful, either to the child or to the parent-child relationship, as verbal abuse. The authors suggest that when social workers and others make decisions about families that share these beliefs, they should understand the significance of the preferred child rearing practices of the people involved.

The identification of macro constraints and the illustration of individual agency in the negotiation of identity extends the symbolic interactionist perspective on identity formation. The author captures the micro level social process of racial formation through an analysis of women's ability to rearticulate the meaning of stigma. This research also adds to the symbolic interactionist literature that emphasizes face-to-face interaction, the micro processes, in the construction of self by revealing the dynamic interplay between macro and micro processes in the development of racial identity. The date used are drawn from a larger study that examines the racial and gendered identity constructions of 27 mixed-race women living in the US. The women in this study reject dominant patterns of stigma by reassigning stigma to their European ancestry. Given this reversal, women articulate and embrace non-white identities.

This study drew on intensive interviews of 21 couples living in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The study concludes that cultural and experiential differences can challenge a multiracial couple, and they can also be challenged by all the issues that arise for some race couples; but the greatest challenge seems to be that created by racism in the US.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) The goal of this volume is to discuss in depth the ways in which various ""deviations"" from traditional family styles affect childrearing practices and child development. Instead of dwelling on the ""deviance"" of these childrearing modes or styles, the contributors each attempt to illustrate the dynamic developmental processes that characterize parenting and child development in contexts that can be deemed nontraditional because they do not reflect the demographic characteristics of the traditional families on which social scientists have largely focused. Contributors thus deal with the dynamics and possible effects of dual-earner families, families with unusually involved fathers, families characterized by the occurrence of divorce, single parenthood, remarriage, poverty, adoption, reliance on nonparental childcare, ethnic membership (Black, Latino, or interracial), parents with lesbian or gay sexual orientations, as well as violent and/or neglectful parents. All the chapters offer answers to a common question: How do these patterns of childcare affect children, their experiences, and their developmental processes? This book will be of value to social scientists, as well as to those professionals concerned with guiding and advising clients and public policy.

Eight bipolar patients (2 females; aged 15-41 yrs) took 900 mg of lithium carbonate after overnight fasting. Blood samples of 5 mL were taken after 15 min, 30 min, 45 min,1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 7 hr, 9 hr,15 hr, 25 hr and 31 hr after dosing. Computer programs were used for pharmacokinetic analysis. Most of the pharmacokinetic parameters were within the ranges reported in investigations of Caucasian Ss. It is concluded that racial differences in lithium pharmacokinetics might not exist. It is suggested that methodological designs, including method of blood sampling, measurement of lithium, and pharmacokinetic and statistical calculations, be standardized if future cross-ethnic comparisons are to be conducted.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Discusses the quality and problems of the General Social Survey (GSS) that is used as a database for social scientific research, and how it offers limited scope about attitudes toward interracial marriage. First, there are only 2 questions on the survey about interracial marriages and the responses do not clearly define true feelings. Second, the use of the term Black is arbitrary and relative to cultural. In the US, one Black ancestor makes a person Black. The flexibility of color classifications across geographical boundaries and concerns of scholars with the American color dichotomy lead to problems regarding the use of ""Black"" in the GSS. A study group of 11 couples were interviewed and videotaped regarding their feelings about intermarriage. The findings suggest that Blacks are ambivalent toward the unions and Whites are concerned with the skin color of their children's offsprings and how this may impact on their lives. These reactions are congruent with American beliefs about racial purity and lead White partners to doubt that equality between the racial groups has been achieved or that protective laws guard against injustice. It is concluded that the focus groups provide more access to everyday reality about intermarriage that the GSS.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Multiracial Couples: Black and White Voices by Paul C. Rosenblatt, Terri A. Karis and Richard D. Powell (1995). Couples therapy and the study of couples seems to be of great interest to many in recent years. Multiracial Couples: Black & White Voices is designed to share the experiences of 21 heterosexual, black and white couples from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The book focuses more on each couple's experiences rather than the theory of multiracial couples and racism. Minimal interpretation is offered allowing the actual voices of the people interviewed to truly be heard. Taken as a whole, the book does offer a legitimate contribution to the literature. Many works written on cultural diversity and mental health are conveyed through the eyes of professionals not necessarily those that are being helped. This book presents a different perspective on how to view multiracial couples and it might assist professionals in alleviating the confusion and pain that couples face.

All but three of the 16 chapters have been published here for the first time. Each chapter provides examples of racialism and the media by addressing such contemporary issues as the films of Spike Lee; Hollywood's ""New Ghetto Aesthetic""; newspaper coverage of the Los Angeles racial disturbances and of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun's Illinois campaign; interracial couple intimacy on TV soap operas; African American community radio; and rap music, Black men, and the police. A strength of this book is its exclusive focus on African Americans. Although the issues explored in this volume are of import to media teachers, media scholars, media critics, media practitioners, and media consumers, some of the chapters' treatment of these issues would have benefitted from a more critical interrogation of the texts, discourses, and agents under examination. In conclusion, this book's primary utility would be as a supplementary reader in a course on African Americans and the media.

Review of Multiracial Couples: Black and White Voices by Paul C. Rosenblatt, Terri A. Karis, and Richard D. Powell (see record 1995-98853-000). The book provides a broad analysis of aspects of relating and having a public identity experienced by people in multiracial couples. The evidence reported only partially relates to the experience of prejudice or loss. The general categories of information obtained by Rosenblatt, Karis, and Powell include how families received the multiracial couples; the treatment couples experienced in interactions in the general public, such as in the workplace or in encounters with strangers while eating or shopping; issues in bringing up multiracial children; learning from each other and from different cultures; and couples finding support in their communities. The study had limits, especially its limited focus to African American and White relationships. At the same time, however, this is a pioneering effort in an area that deserves much greater attention in the relationship and family field. What the reviewers came away with from this book was a better sense of what multiracial couples encounter just ""to be"" in this society. Further, as is clear in the narratives, many communities are not likely to be as supportive of multiracial couples as is the Twin Cities area.

Basic concepts of the theory and its interrelated propositions are identified. A comprehensive literature review gauged its empirical support. With some qualifications, a set of 26 quantitative studies supported propositions regarding the relationship of unequal power to role-taking propensity, accuracy, and empathy. Examination of 8 qualitative studies offered fruitful directions for theoretical refinements. A set of 15 practice effectiveness studies suggest that role-taking processes in asymmetrical relationships can be changed. Practice implications for social workers committed to challenging the power imbalances typical to cross-gender, interracial, interclass, and cross-position relationships are suggested.

These 3 generations differ considerably in motives and attitudes concerning adoption. Changes in the adoption field are connected with important changes in society. Adoption has lost its taboo character, domestic adoption is decreasing or has almost vanished (Scandinavia, The Netherlands) and interracial adoption has started. Several figures illustrating changes in adoption patterns during the period 1960-1995 support the hypothesis.

Results indicate that students' perceptions of a more positive interracial classroom climate were associated with less frequent and more effective coping strategies, specifically as related to the frequency and effectiveness of positive/approach coping strategies. Positive classroom climate also was related to higher self-esteem and better academic performance. This research highlights the importance of (1) the presence of contact criteria when desegregation is to be a positive experience both academically and socially and (2) the integration of coping strategies as a means of reducing interracial stress.

The authors present results of an evaluation of a prejudice reduction program that trains and places college student facilitators in middle and high school classrooms to lead discussions about race. Survey data was taken from 35 teachers. Results show that a composite of 5 classroom climate conditions that the Contact Hypothesis suggests are conducive to prejudice reduction predicts teachers' and college student facilitators' perceptions of change in 3 aspects of middle and high school student racial attitudes. Students' perceptions of the school interracial climate are modestly predictive of their changes in these 3 aspects of racial attitudes. However, teacher and facilitator estimates of student outcomes are uncorrelated with actual student outcomes. Implications of these results for prejudice reduction theory and practice are discussed.

A correlational approach was used to investigate the relationships between marital adjustment, measured by the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and (a) racism, measured by a Racism Questionnaire, (b) spiritual well-being, measured by the Spiritual Well-Being Scale, (c) acculturation, measured by the African American Acculturation Scale-33, and (d) communication patterns, measured by the Communication Patterns Questionnaire. It was hypothesized that (a) the degree of racism experienced by couples would be negatively related to marital adjustment, (b) the degree of similarity in spouses' level of spiritual well-being would be positively related to marital adjustment, (c) the degree of similarity in spouses' level of acculturation would be positively related to marital adjustment, and (d) a constructive pattern of communication would be positively related to marital adjustment. Results indicated that acculturation and Religious Well-Being showed no relationship to marital adjustment. Racism experienced by wives was negatively related to the marital adjustment of these women and Black men. Similarity in Existential Well-Being was also positively related to adjustment for White women and Black men but not for Black women and White men. Existential Well-Being itself was also related to marital adjustment for White women and Black men. The Communication Patterns Questionnaire was found to be valid with Black-White interracially married couples and the Constructive Communication subscale was positively correlated with marital adjustment. Implications of these results and future directions for research are discussed.

Seven European American scholars were asked about motivations and maintenance of their commitment to the field, while seven scholars of Color were asked about their perceptions of White colleagues' motivations. All participants were asked for advice for current White psychology students and professionals who desire to increase racial awareness and multicultural competence. Qualitative methodology was utilized to analyze the participants' responses. An interpretive/constructivist paradigm (Highlen & Finley, 1996), was utilized to deconstruct and reconstruct the linguistic data (Hoshmand, 1989). This involved the generation of themes via a modified idiosyncratic investigator analysis, followed by the development of generalized relations among the themes through interpretation. The result was the development of a coherent model of construed meaning to explain White racism awareness and multicultural competence. Findings from the present study indicated that the most significant aspects of being perceived as a White ally were genuine motivations and efforts to become culturally competent. Additionally, results supported current models of White racial identity development as well as the possibility of increased interracial collaboration through ""selective appreciation.""

Extensive search of the literature revealed a paucity of literature relative to this process. It is this researcher's belief that couples in interracial marriages bring to the marriage diverse world views that produce strains and even serious conflict that affect the development of a shared family identity. Using an ethnographic research approach, interracial couples participated in structured interviews. Researcher and couples' perspectives about core issues in how the couples mediate their family identity were examined. Based on this study, couples acknowledged the importance of educating their children about being biracial and exposing them to a balanced view of their families, and passing on the positive as well as the negative attributes of both sides of their family in support of helping their children develop a cohesive personal identity. This study also revealed that both parents took on a protective role regarding how their children may be viewed by others in society based on their children's dual identity. Further, as interracial couples continue to create and present a balanced view of their family, their biracial children will experience less core identity conflict and will be able to mediate social marginality. This study has implications for other interracial couples, teachers, and health, mental health, and social service professionals who interact with these families.

Previous research on immigrant wives has found that the wives feel alienated, unnoticed, isolated, struggling to keep their identity; that development was disrupted, and the wives feel not in step (Barbara, 1989; Espin, 1992; Imamura, 1990; Prawer Jhabvala, 1985; Romano, 1988). Previous works on Identity and the Self have used concepts such as ""true self"", ""false self"", ""real self"", or ""autonomous individual"" (Maslow, 1970; Masterson, 1985; Winnicott, 1969). Criticism has been that this Western concept of Self does not apply to persons of non-Western cultures (Chu, 1985; Hsu, 1985; Kaschak, 1992). Existentialism purports that the sense of authenticity is independent of the identity bestowed by one's culture (Bugental, 1976; Heidegger, 1962; Kierkegaard, 1959; Nietzsche, 1994; Sartre, 1956). Answers to the following questions were sought: (1) What effect will the immersion in a different culture have on a person's sense of identity? (2) Will this immersion result in a decreased (Barbara, 1989; Imamura, 1990; Romano, 1988) or increased (Taylor 1991; Bugental, 1976) sense of authenticity, or is authenticity independent of culture (Kierkegaard, 1959)? Seven women of Asian and South American background were interviewed. Data were analyzed using coding systems suggested by Strauss and Corbin (1990), utilizing the QSR NUD*IST{TM} computer program, to reveal the most salient and frequent topics. Results include the formation of a stage model of acculturation under headings of ""Preliminal"" (before marriage), ""Liminal"" (around time of marriage) and ""Postliminal"" (after marriage). It is suggested that immigration and acculturation is part of a longer process starting early in the participants' life: the striving to become more authentic by increasing personal potential restricted in the home culture through poverty or the role of women. The Existential concept of authenticity is suggested to be applicable to this process. Further research into the relationship of home culture and the nature of the acculturation process is suggested.

African American males, in particular, are frequently the object of racial bias and fear responses (Dembo, 1988). This study was designed to explore several facets of crossracial interactions of young male African Americans and Caucasian Americans. Specific goals were to analyze how the presentation of information that another young male, from a different racial group, displaying either high or low levels of fear in interracial interactions and either high or low levels of prejudicial attitudes would affect rates of cooperative behavior in a mixed-motive game and social impression ratings of identified co-players. In addition, responses on a self-reported measure related to racial attitudes were utilized to regroup participants by theoretical stages of development, and then reanalyze game playing responses. Sixty-seven male African American and sixty-eight male Caucasian American middle school, secondary school and two-year college students (ages 11-20) living in suburban regions of New York State participated in the study. Each participant played four, twenty-five trial rounds of a mixed-motive prisoner's dilemma game with different race co-players identified as demonstrating either high or low levels of fear responses during interracial interactions, and racial prejudice. Participants played the game with identified co-players on a computer making choices according to a randomly generated sixty percent cooperative response rate. The study took the form of a 2 x 2 x 2 design, with race of participant (African American vs. Caucasian American), perception of fear in interracial interaction (high vs. low), and perception of racial bias (high vs. low) as factors. Rate of cooperative responses during each phase of the prisoner's dilemma game was measured as a dependent variable both within subjects and between racial groups. In addition a social impression rating of identified co-players was taken following each round of the game. The Racial Attitude Identity Scale (RIAS) or White Racial Attitude Identity Scale (WRIAS) (Helms, 1990), was analyzed as a non-manipulated independent variable by grouping participants into theoretical identity development stages. Demographic information (parent education, family income) and prior experience with cooperative learning strategies in school settings was also collected. It was hypothesized but not supported that: (1) male African Americans in the high fear-low prejudice condition would have the highest rates of cooperation and those in the low fear-high prejudice condition would cooperate the least across all groups; (2) Caucasian Americans in high fear-low prejudice condition would cooperate at lower rates than African Americans in the same experimental condition. Support was found for the following hypotheses: (1) Across racial groups, participants in low fear-low prejudice conditions rated co-players more positively on the social impression rating; (2) Among African American participants in immersion-emersion stage of racial identity development on the RIAS cooperated at lower levels than other stages; and (3) Caucasian Americans in the reintegration stage on the WRIAS cooperated less than other developmental stages.

Teachers, what they believe and why they believe it, impact and influence student development in matters of character as well. This study explores teachers' attitudes and beliefs about four controversial topics: interracial dating, homosexuality as a curricular topic in public high schools, censorship of high school student press, and freedom of expression through dress. These attitudes and beliefs are teased are examined through the combined use of both quantitative and a qualitative methods. The quantitative method, a survey, is made up of fourteen questions borrowed from national polls, twelve similarly constructed questions, and eleven questions related to four ""real-life"" vignettes. The vignettes are intended to provoke thought and frame the subsequent qualitative component, the use of focus groups. Focus groups began over sixty years ago but have only in the past decade found their niche in social science research. For while they have enjoyed extensive use in marketing, focus groups do not provide the neat and tidy findings common to its quantitative counterparts. What focus groups do provide is depth. They allow a researcher to ask why opinions and beliefs are held. In focus groups, group interaction enables debate and reflection uncommon to other methodologies. In this study, focus groups were used to ask teachers about their responses to the vignettes. Eight focus groups were held with a total of seventy-seven participants, all experienced teachers. In addition two hundred, forty-five students in graduate education programs completed the survey instrument. The data collected enabled an examination of attitudes and beliefs and a determination of whether teachers chose tolerance when it was an option for behavior. Tolerance is a virtue that enables people to live together peacefully in a diverse society. As our society grows ever larger and more diverse, tolerance will become an increasingly necessary component of our young people's character. This study has found that many teachers often choose to avoid offending others and to maintain social order above tolerance. The implications of this are considered and suggestions offered for consideration.

Its purpose was to investigate the relationship between adoption status, gender, intellectual ability, and age and the perceptions of parent-adolescent communication of both parents and adolescents. The data were from the Minnesota Transracial Adoption Project: Follow-up at Adolescence, a study of 93 white, middle to upper-middle class families who adopted African-American and interracial children conducted from 1984 to 1986 and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF/BNS 8312605). Subjects for this study were 82 fathers and 89 mothers along with 128 adopted and 88 biological adolescents aged 14-24 years, all of whom completed the Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale and either WISC-R or WAIS-R. Parent-adolescent communication in the adopted and biological children in this sample was basically positive. There was low to moderate agreement between parents and adolescents and moderate to strong agreement between mothers and fathers in ratings of communication. With regard to mother-adolescent communication, no significant differences were attributable to adoption status or intellectual ability. Significant differences were attributable to age and gender. Sons rated communication to be better, with more openness and fewer problems in communication, than daughters did and mothers experienced better, more open and problem-free communication with older than younger adolescents. An interaction was found between adoption status and gender for mothers' perceptions of communication problems. With regard to father-adolescent communication, no significant differences were attributable to gender but were to adoption status, intellectual ability, and age. Fathers experienced better and more open communication with biological adolescents. Adolescents with higher IQ scores experienced better and more problem-free communication with fathers. Fathers and adolescents both agreed that older adolescents experienced better and more open communication. Possible explanations for these results were discussed and the limitations of the data due to the sample, the measure, and the lack of causal data were mentioned. Suggestions for future research included investigating the relationship between parent-adolescent communication and behavioral adjustment, especially focusing on father-adolescent communication and longitudinal designs, as well as further elucidation of the role of intellectual ability in communication between parents and adolescents.

The current study sought to determine whether information is spontaneously organized in memory around the marital relationship for inter-racial couples as it is for intra-racial couples (Sedikides, Olsen, & Reis, 1993). It was predicted that it would not be. Couples matched or mismatched on occupation were included since it was predicted that dissimilarities other than race might interfere with a couple being viewed as a social unit. One hundred and eighty participants were randomly assigned to one of the cells of a 2 (attribute: race or occupation) by 2 (relationship: matched on attribute vs mismatched on attribute) between-subjects design. Participants received information about 8 target individuals who comprised 4 couples. Their task was to memorize the information presented about each target. After timed exposure to each target, participants completed recall and recognition tasks, and belief similarity measures. Partial support for the hypothesis that mismatched couples would be less likely to be perceived as a social unit than matched couples was found for within couple and between-couple errors on recognition tasks. However, responses to the free-recall measure did not show greater spontaneous use of the marital relationship category for matched compared to mismatched couples. Belief similarity measures suggested that couples matched on race or occupation were perceived as more similar on a variety of dimensions (e.g., values, morals, attitudes) compared to mismatched couples as expected. Since the same pattern emerged for couples mismatched on occupation as for those mismatched on race, findings suggest that it is not race per se but rather a lack of perceived similarity that discourages the perception of couples as a unit.

Desegregation at educational institutions is still in its embryonic stage and the minimal changes at college campuses are tokenistic. Educators have to make a concerted effort to review the dynamics and complexities of institutional change and to deviate from the straitjacket of upholding only ethnocentric views. A lack of communication and understanding between the different racial and ethnic groups on South African campuses has resulted in conflict and tension. This study takes an in-depth look at the psychology of prejudice, issues of ethnicity, racism and discrimination. A literature study and an empirical research project are used to gain an overview of the ramifications of racism on the formation of friendships in a multicultural milieu. The results of this study indicate the need to create a diversified campus environment which will promote genuine cross-cultural exchange. Working with culturally different students is a challenge that requires an acceptance and appreciation of diversity, flexibility, and improved contact and communication. Structured multicultural models and procedural frameworks have been designed specifically for implementation at institutions of higher learning to enhance social cohesion. The following recommendations are made: (1) Transitions models such as the contact hypothesis and the co-operative learning models promote the need for an interracial contact of people with equal status in co-operative situations. (2) Prejudice-Reduction Workshops will enable participants to learn about prejudice and to develop a positive mind-set towards all racial groups. (3) Specialized Programmes such as intercultural simulation games are ideal for discussions on culture shock, ethnocentrism and enculturation.

A major goal of this project was to complement and improve upon existing studies of interracial families. This study tested hypotheses generated by marginalization and assimilation theories on the adjustment and well-being of minority groups. These theories predict that individuals in interracial unions will experience more stress and strain and may be at risk for higher marital instability and lower well-being than individuals in same-race unions because: (1) these individuals are more likely to be marginalized and less integrated, and that (2) on an individual level, minority spouses who are less assimilated into their partner's culture will experience more conflicts due to cultural differences than individuals in same-race marriages, while more assimilated minority spouses who have adopted the current majority attitudes toward divorce will perceive lower marital stability if their marriages are unsatisfactory. An alternative hypothesis was proposed using the resiliency perspective. This perspective focuses on the positive functioning and resources of interracial marriages and predicts that the unique challenges of interracial relationships may facilitate personal growth and enhance the stability of such relationships. Husbands and wives in three types of marriages (same-race white, same-race Asian, and Asian-white marriages) were each asked to fill out a self-administered questionnaire. Asian subjects in this study were highly assimilated culturally and structurally. Overall, analyses of their responses on seven measures of their marital quality and perceived instability revealed that interracially married individuals do not differ significantly from intraracially married individuals. Two exceptions are found on two of five measures of marital instability: (1) interracially married Asian males significantly perceive their marriages to be less positive; (2) interracially married white males were significantly less likely to report marital trouble in the past year. In addition, Asian spouses in same-race marriages reported significantly lower marital quality, a higher probability of being maritally distressed, and less positive views of their marital histories than white spouses in same-race marriages. Finally, interracially married Asian husbands perceived significantly lower social integration and support than husbands in other unions indicating that they may be more marginalized.

In the first part, two assumptions presented in Janet Helms' White Racial Identity (WRI) development model (1990) were tested. First, Helms theorized that one's stage of WRI development is positively related to increased cognitive complexity achievement and suggests that later stages require greater complexity. A second assumption of Helms' theory was that continued interracial contact is essential for advancement in WRI stage development. Part one of this study examined the relationship of cognitive complexity and interracial contact (both formal and informal) to WRI, and the relationship between cognitive complexity and interracial contact as they relate to WRI. Part two of this study consisted of a factor analysis of Helms' WRI measure followed by a second set of analyses examining the relationship between the new obtained factors with contact and cognitive complexity. This analysis allowed a comparison to be made between Helms' 5 WRI stages and the obtained factor solution from the factor analysis. It also allowed a comparison of the relationship between the stages and cognitive complexity and contact and the obtained factor solution and these same variables. Three hundred and sixty-eight White undergraduates completed Helms' White Racial Identity Attitude Scale, a 4 x 6 Repertory Grid, measuring cognitive complexity in social settings, and an interracial contact measure, including a measure of both formal and informal types of contact. Results of part one of the analyses indicated that neither cognitive complexity nor cognitive complexity x contact were significantly related to WRI scores. However, contact was significantly related to WRI scores. WRI stage two was positively related and WRI stage four was negatively related to scores on formal contact. Stage 4 was negatively related and stages 2 and 3 were positively related to scores on informal contact. The results of part two indicated again that neither cognitive complexity nor cognitive complexity x contact were significantly related to the obtained WRI factors. However, contact once again was significant. The factor analysis produced a 5 factor solution that while similar in theme and number to the 5 stages, nonetheless indicated a different relationship with contact scores than the stages did. Factor 3 (representing stage 4) was positively related and factor 4 (representing stages 2 and 3) was negatively related to formal contact scores. However, factor 3 (representing stage 4) was positively related and factor 4 (representing stages 2 and 3) were negatively related to scores on informal contact. There were discrepancies across the two parts of the study as to the stages and direction of the relationships between interracial contact (formal and informal) and WRI scores. Some of these results were in opposite directions than either the theory or study expected. These discrepancies are dealt with in chapter 5.

Partners' knowledge about their relationship begins as general beliefs and knowledge of past relationships and becomes increasingly more specific as involvement deepens. The more coupled partners communicate with one another and deepen their involvement, the more shared knowledge about the relationship they should acquire. The extent to which partners have similar general knowledge about relationships due to cultural background should also influence whether they interpret events in similar ways, and how much shared knowledge they have. This study examined shared knowledge between coupled partners in their explanations for why they became more or less committed to marriage over time. The random sample consisted of 310 respondents (156 women and 154 men) who had never married and were involved in heterosexual relationships. Respondents were interviewed separately about how their relationship changed over time and completed questionnaires about their personal history and traits, the other partner, and the relationship. Qualitatively different categories of shared knowledge were coded by comparing the accounts of coupled partners for why commitment changed over time. Patterns of shared knowledge were examined in relation to stage of involvement, similarity of race or ethnicity (measured as same race or ethnic relationships and interracial or interethnic relationships), communication between partners, social concern, and communication with the joint network. The results of the study showed that at committed stages of involvement, partners have more related knowledge than at lower stages of involvement, but for women only. Partners involved in same race or ethnic relationships have less unshared shared knowledge than partners involved in interracial or interethnic relationships, but this hypothesis merits retesting. Communication as a correlate of shared knowledge holds only for women: Communication between partners increases as shared knowledge increases. In contrast, communication with the joint network increases as unshared knowledge increases. Positive network concern for the continuation of the relationship was associated with related knowledge, but this association needs further examination.

In 1933, the United Mine Workers (UMW) adopted the ""UMW formula"" for placing Black workers in positions as union officers and organizers. Adopted from more radical unions, the formula institutionalized racial inclusion, which proved to be a major tactical innovation in realizing class solidarity across racial lines. Faced with similar conditions, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee in 1937 and the United Auto Workers in 1940 adopted variants of the UMW formula to overcome racial barriers to organizing. The authors analyze narratives of these 3 drives using event-structure analysis (ESA), a diachronic method, and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), a synchronic method. Both approaches reveal the importance of 3 main factors: tactical innovations, political context, and labor market conditions. The 1st 2 factors are explained by political process theory, and the 3rd is predicted by split labor market theory. Among these findings, ESA highlights path dependence of tactical innovations and QCA emphasizes structural conditions in the labor market.

Although there were differences between groups, it appears that length of time, exposure to American society, and acculturation, all related to generation, begin a process leading to higher rates of out-marriage. The Japanese Americans, primarily a third generation group, had the highest rates of out-marriage. The Koreans, primarily a first-generation immigrant population, had the lowest rates. Females, especially of the American-born generations, also were more likely to marry non-Asians than were those who were born in the old country.

(from the chapter) Eight children (aged 18-34 yrs) of mixed marriages were interviewed. Some reported experiencing problems in being accepted, or wanting to be accepted, by one or other of the cultural groups to which they were affiliated. Physical characteristics denoting obvious difference from the majority seem to be important in identity questions. As a result, friendships with non-kin peer groups have often assumed great importance. Attitudes to gender relations were also mentioned as important, especially for women. Changes occurred for some as they matured, as perceptions and experiences varied significantly, or their place of residence or other circumstances changed. Class and SES were also significant factors.

The relationships of power that characterize these marriages, the changes in balance of power that result from the externalization of anger, physical and verbal violence, and stigmatization of domestic violence experienced by Filipinas individually and in the community was explored.

African American solos were judged more favorably and were more often selected to be leader than were White targets in both African American and White majorities. More generally, these findings indicate that theories of relative numbers and salience effects that explain group processes in gender contexts do not apply in the same way to race contexts.

R. Burt, 1980) and read a scenario of an acquaintance rape; the race of the perpetrator and victim (Black or White) were varied. The respondents assessed the victim's and perpetrator's responsibility and evaluated the incident. As hypothesized, the respondents with strong beliefs in rape myths were more tolerant of the rapist and less tolerant of the victim than were those with weaker beliefs. There was limited support for the myth of the Black rapist and White victim; however, the myth of the Black rapist appeared particularly strong among the Black respondents. The women responded more negatively to the rapist and more positively to the victim than the men did. Such bias in attitudes toward rape could keep women from reporting rapes and accused rapists from receiving fair trials.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Discussions of race-based transference in the psychoanalytic literature have been infrequent. When present, such transference has been described from the Freudian or Kleinian perspective, as either a manifestation of intrapsychic conflicts or projection of unwanted mental content onto the racial other. These views, although helpful in some situations, exclude other possible meanings of interracial transference. This article describes an approach based on contemporary intersubjective theories in which race-related transference is seen as one aspect of a person's ongoing construction of experience and understanding of the unique meaning of race for each patient is emphasized. The far-reaching influence of the analyst's race and culture in the development of transference is then described, and it is argued that the analyst needs to be aware of the culture embeddedness of her or his therapeutic endeavors. Treatment issues are discussed with clinical examples.

It contains several important organizing themes that represent the book's major strengths. Its most central and consistent theme is the tenet that family's critical functions are the socialization of children, the social and psychological support of family members, and the provision of a stable and beneficial environment for family life. The 23 chapters of the text are divided into four sections that deal with issues of current social, cultural and demographic statuses of ethnic families; cultural patterns in parenting and socialization practices; attitudes surrounding interracial dating and marriage; and the influences of ethnicity, race, and family structure on health and educational outcomes. The reviewer notes that the weakest aspect of the book deals with the analyses on interracial marriages. The quality of the chapters also was noted to vary in strength.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Posted date: November, 1997. In the history of prejudice research in social psychology, there has been a long and arduous search for an unobtrusive methodology for assessing interracial and interethnic prejudice. One of the first reported unobtrusive measures was the bogus pipeline technique (E. E. Jones and H. Sigall, 1971). Jones and Sigall's measure was unequivocal in its ability to covertly assess prejudice. However, because of the great monetary cost and precision that the technique requires, others have attempted to devise more appropriate measures. Rio (1972) devised a technique that was based on the methods of early group conformity researchers. The present study reports a replication of a study by C. Garcia et al (1993) using a more modern sample of 36 female Anglo- and Hispanic-American college students. It was found that an ethnic bias could not be statistically demonstrated using this method. Implications for the validity of the methodology and directions for future research are discussed.

Specifically, the Latino child (aged 2-18 yrs) adopted from another country by a family of similar origin or as a part of a family, newly immigrated to this country, who for whatever reason involuntarily lost or voluntarily relinquished their child for adoption. Specifics of the Latino culture in terms of ancestry, language, codes of behavior, values, time orientation, family makeup, gender roles sexuality, work ethic, education, and spirituality are presented in order to understand the needs of a Latino child. Areas of concern are addressed. It is argued that transracial adoptions create a particular set of distinct problems. The author contends that it is in the best interest of the child in all areas of their development, to provide them with a family that is most similar to themselves, racially, ethnically, and culturally.

This research endeavor attempted to determine if nonracial factors characterized by socioeconomic and commonality variables are more important in the mate selection process in comparison with those related to racial differences. Race, gender, age, and educational achievement of the biracially married individual were introduced as independent variables along with premarital biracial dating history to determine if they mitigate the influence of marital selection factors. A national sample of biracially married individuals was identified through a research advertisement placed in 12 consecutive issues of the Interrace magazine. 371 participants from 38 states within the US completed a mail-out questionnaire and 292 26-54 yr old respondents were included for analysis. The results reveal that nonracial factors are more important than racial factors for spouse selection among Ss. Many Ss stated that common interests and attractiveness of the person, irrespective of racial group membership, were very important factors.

However, classic statements on this subject present contrasting hypotheses. This article extends previous work by examining how the extensive media coverage of an interracial homicide influences public attitudes toward the criminal justice system. Initial results indicate that race, education, and police contact directly affect perceptions of criminal injustice. Perceptions of injustice are especially high among well-educated Blacks who have had recent contact with the police. Further analysis reveals that the media coverage of the homicide seems temporarily to consolidate public confidence in the police and criminal courts. However, this effect varies by race and education. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings.

Data analysis was based on 241 respondents who were drawn from 28 states of the US. The mean age of the subjects was 14 with males and females comprising approximately 43 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. Especially, for this study, the measurement scales for parental support of ethnic identity and shame about ethnic origin were developed. The analyses represent an initial attempt to examine the relationship among constructs that potentially influence the transracially adopted child's psychological adjustment. With the success of finding evidence for collective self-esteem on successful psychological adjustment, all hypothesized effects among parent's support of ethnic background and child's collective self-esteem variables were supported by the data. As was the case with results concerning the relationships among the adolescents' psychological adjustment variables, one expected effect of family context factors was also supported. The significant effect of the level of the positive parent-child relationship was positive. In addition to the results associated with the hypothesized model effects, there were statistically significant relationships between parent's support of ethnic background and positive parent-child relationship. The findings of the study stress the transaction between adoptive parents and children in terms of sharing experiences of children's ethnic socialization and establishes that positive relationship is the fundamental factor for children to develop a unique process of identity development. The outcomes of the study suggest that social workers have to continue to study the diverse needs of adoptive parents and develop appropriate intervention strategies in order to improve family functioning.

Since little research exists in this area, research questions rather than hypotheses were addressed and an exploratory multiple-design case study was undertaken. In the exploratory case-study, a pilot sample was collected prior to the final definition of the research questions. The theory was discovered as the questions were answered. Hence, it was a prelude for further research. Eight couples, consisting of Swedish women married to American men, living in the Bay Area were interviewed on a single occasion for 90 minutes. The couples were selected based upon a snowball procedure in order to get a selection of participants who were unknown to the researcher. Each couple was interviewed together in order to acquire the greatest amount of interactional information from each couple. A set of structured interview questions, which had been designed to answer the research questions, was asked. An opportunity for a follow-up phone call was established in the event that the couple had thought of additional pertinent information. Each participant was given a short questionnaire (see appendix B) before the interview to fill out separately and confidentially. The purpose of this study was to begin to identify the themes of the marriages. The data were summarized for each couple, and among all the couples, in order to make some conclusions about the sample and each question/content area. The cross-comparisons aided in exploring each question and identifying issues and possible commonalities between couples. Differences between the Swedish and American cultures were small in comparison to those between Eastern and Western cultures. Accordingly, I expected to find comparatively subtle or lesser differences than the differences turned out to be. They were so subtle that the couples did not realize their existence at first. Most couples had come to terms with their discrepant views after their first year of marriage. The couples had difficulty pinning down what the differences were since they were resolved a long time ago. The five most frequently mentioned statements were: husband's long work hours, the husbands' desire to speak Swedish, strong Swedish identity, husband's involvement in Swedish events, and differing gender roles expectations. In conclusion, the wives' whose husbands expressed the most appreciation for the added cultural aspects also had the highest marital satisfaction. Most husbands appreciated the cultural diversity their wives brought into their lives. Marrying a spouse from a different country can be challenging but also rewarding depending on how flexible the partners are with each other.

The construct of ethnic identity was examined along with factors identified in the literature as influencing racial/ethnic identity development such as family support of multiracial heritage, sense of belonging, coping with discrimination, and racial/ethnic legitimacy testing. An attempt was also made to explore how ethnic identity and other factors such as self-esteem, racial diversity of the community in which one was raised, and choice of self-label are related. Seventy-three multiracial adults completed measures that assessed ethnic identity, self-esteem, racial/ethnic legitimacy testing experiences, family support of multiracial heritage and coping. Results indicated that a majority of participants had experienced racial/ethnic legitimacy testing from those racial groups which were part of their racial/ethnic heritage. While self-esteem was not found to be related to racial/ethnic legitimacy testing as predicted, statistically significant relationships were obtained between self-esteem and ethnic identity, and self-esteem and family support of multiraciality. Family support of multiraciality and racial diversity of neighborhood in which individual was raised were found to be significant predictors of ethnic identity. This finding is consistent with existing literature which has identified these two factors as having a positive impact on racial identity resolution. Participants were asked to identify a stressful situation in which they felt rejected due to some aspect of their multiracial heritage. A component of ethnic identity labeled ethnic identity achievement was found to be related to coping strategies that involved attempts to either alter this stressful situation or create some positive meaning from it. No significant predictors of choice of monoracial or multiracial self-label were identified. Methodological limitations of some of the measures, as well as the small sample size, were identified as reasons for interpreting these findings with caution. Further research using improved measures to assess the constructs of interest was recommended. Implications for counseling were discussed.

Data collection included (1) a semi-structured interview to determine subjects' own sense of racial/ethnic identity, (2) a measure of parental closeness, and (3) a series of twelve anecdotal hypothetical situations as a stimulus to revealing subjects' affective, cognitive and behavioral responses in contexts in which the subjects mixed-heritage might be expected to evoke conflict. A qualitative analysis, incorporating socio-cultural, psychodynamic, and historical perspectives, was utilized to investigate (1) racial and cultural stereotyping, (2) a hierarchy of color and racial categorization, (3) racial tolerance, (4) Black and Jewish relations, (5) biracial (Black and Jewish) identity, as mediated by parental and familial closeness. Factors that influenced racial/identity development in the subjects' lives were identified. Five of the six hypotheses were supported: (1) Phenotype is related to interpersonal perception. The biracial adult phenotypically perceived as African-American is more likely to identify as such, whereas the biracial adult phenotypically perceived as White is more likely to identify as either White or ""mixed."" (2) Closeness to the African-American parent is not necessary for children of mixed-race/Jewish heritage to identity with African-American heritage. (3) Closeness to the Jewish parent is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for children of mixed-race/Jewish heritage to identity with Jewish heritage. (4) For those who are close to their Jewish parent, the degree of closeness affects the degree to which they identify as Jews. (5) The extent to which respondents experience themselves as integral parts of their extended families will increase the extent to which they identify with that half of their cultural heritage. The sixth hypothesis, which stated that to the degree that respondents express negative stereotypes of one part of their heritage they will also minimize their identification with that part of their heritage was not supported due chiefly to the lack of negative stereotyping by most of the respondents.

Grounded explicitly in feminist and hermeneutic theories, the methodology of this research consists primarily of an interpretive reading of transcribed interview narratives. In addition to thematic content, five narrative voices emerged as the women described and reflected upon their values and experiences. Moving beyond the dichotomy of ""traditional"" versus ""modern"" with respect to gender roles and acculturation, this interpretive method allowed for the multiplicity of women's voices and for the complexity of their subjectivity. Findings were primarily qualitative; however, some quantitative results were obtained. High inter-rater reliability was established between interpreters. Quantitative comparisons between the first and second generations suggested a statistically significant difference in the pattern of voices, and of thematic content associated with the voices (e.g., arranged marriage, spousal roles, dating, authority to parents, parenting practices). Of the numerous themes that emerged in the women's narratives, themes important to both generations include family honour (izzat), daughter as something held in trust (amanat), education, interracial relationships, and the conflict between family and independence. The impact of racism and internalized racism on ethnic identity formation was particularly important for the second generation. Meta-themes that predominated a woman's story (e.g., severe intergenerational conflict) and themes of particular concern for each generation also emerged in the narrative texts. The social context within which South Asian women live in Canada and the clinical implications of these findings are considered.

Specifically, the present study investigated the relationship of White adults' current White racial identity schemas to their recalled intraracial and interracial socialization experiences, as represented by their affective reactions to and contact experiences with three racial groups (Whites, Blacks, and ""minorities""). Three questionnaires were completed by 255 self-identified White American college students (179 women and 76 men). A critical incidents questionnaire (designed for the current study) assessed respondents' affective reactions towards the three racial groups and themselves after the respondents had recounted each of two experiences that they identified as being critical in the development of their race-related attitudes. Respondents also completed the Racial Contact Scale (adapted from Stephan & Stephan, 1989) to assess their recalled interracial and intraracial contact at the time of each incident. White racial identity schemas were assessed by responses to either the standard White Racial Identity Attitude Scale (WRIAS) (Helms & Carter, 1990) or a modified version of the WRIAS in which ""minority"" was substituted for ""Black"" as the contrast group in the scale. Multiple regression was used to examine relationships between racial identity schemas and affective reactions and amount and quality of interracial and intraracial contact. Results indicated that, in general, currently expressed White racial identity schemas were related to affective reactions in directions supportive of White racial identity theory. However, the two versions of the WRIAS were differentially related to some of the affective and contact variables in ways that suggest that the two versions of the WRIAS were not necessarily measuring the same racial identity constructs. Also, the results pertaining to the relationships between the White racial identity schemas and the recalled quality and quantity of intraracial and interracial contact were inconclusive because respondents did not have much interracial contact. However, an examination of the critical incidents that participants reported indicated that both interracial and intraracial socialization experiences were related to subsequent racial attitudes.

Goals were to: (1) identify and explicate dimensions of racial discourse, (2) explore factors that explain variations in how and whether people converse about race, and (3) generate hypotheses about characteristics of constructive talk about race. Data were collected using qualitative interviews designed to elicit (1) examples of talk about race, and (2) views on talking about race. Informants were African-American and Euro-American men and women highly experienced with interracial contact and dialogue. Inductive and deductive methods highlighted important aspects of the data. Data from the researcher's self-reflections journal aided interpretation. Universal concerns in informants' talk were: how race bears on (1) one's identity, and (2) relations in society. Dimensions of talk about race as it bears on identity were the: (1) nature of its impact, (2) aspects of self attributed to race, (3) feelings associated with being of a certain race, and (4) development of racial self over time. Dimensions of talk about race as it bears on relations in society were the: (1) significance of race as a causal factor, (2) nature of racial differences, (3) nature of racial commonalities, (4) conceptualizations of diversity within racial groups, and (5) assignment of power, responsibility, vulnerability, and victimization. Key variables in informants' perspectives on talking about race were (1) definitions of talk about race, (2) assessments of its value, and (3) contextual factors that hinder and aide constructive talk. Analyses suggested that even for individuals with high levels of experience, competence, and satisfaction in interracial living, talking about race is challenging and fraught with ambivalence. Furthermore, race and gender, as well as generation, location of residence, and the racial constitution of one's family, were related to ways of talking about race and perspectives on talk about race, suggesting differences in the needs, risks, feelings, and modes of coping that people bring to such conversations. Findings suggest avenues for further research and help to identify conditions under which racial dialogue will be possible and meaningful for all participants.

All participants responded to questionnaires through the mail. The three measures used in this study were the Ways of Coping Questionnaire, Coping Resources Inventory, and Coping Operations Preference Enquiry. Test scores were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis of variance. Results showed that men, regardless of ethnicity, used more planful-problem solving coping strategies then women (p =.017). In addition, Whites used significantly more social coping resources (p =.023) than Blacks. Because the between and within group differences were not significant for 10 remaining variables, it was concluded that gender and ethnicity have only slight effects on the coping strategies and resources used by African American-Caucasian couples.

This study relied on a cross sectional survey design to examine the relationship of the independent variables to self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and conduct problems among a sample of middle school students. Correlational analyses, analysis of variance, and hierarchical regression procedures were used to assess the relationship between the independent variables and self-reported symptoms. Correlational analyses showed that exposure to parental information about proactive strategies for getting along with members of other ethnic groups was positively correlated with academic efficacy. Consistent with the research hypotheses, correlational analyses revealed an inverse relationship between academic self-efficacy and conduct problems. Results also revealed an inverse correlation between efficacy and anxiety. The correlation between efficacy and depression was in the expected direction but was not statistically significant. Ethnic socialization scores also showed an inverse relationship to anxiety and conduct problems, except for exposure to messages of interracial distrust, which was positively correlated with higher levels of internalizing and externalizing distress. Analysis of variance showed no ethnic differences in self-efficacy perceptions, but gender differences in efficacy favored Caucasian females. Ethnic differences, but no gender differences, were found in exposure to parental socialization messages, with African-American students reporting more frequent exposure to ethnicity-related messages. Multiple regression analyses indicated that scores on measures of academic efficacy and ethnic socialization predicted symptoms of anxiety and conduct problems. In unexpected findings, higher levels of academic efficacy predicted lower levels of state anxiety and trait anxiety for African-American males and Caucasian females but were associated with higher levels of anxiety for African-American females and Caucasian males. Furthermore, the independent variables did not predict depressive symptoms. The findings of this research provide support for the hypothesized inverse relationship between academic efficacy and mental health outcomes. The results also provide support for the utility of academic self-efficacy perceptions and, to a lesser extent, ethnic socialization experiences to predict mental health outcomes among adolescents. Future research and implications for interventions with children are discussed.

Sociocultural orientation is defined as a general pattern of behaviors exhibited in intraracial and interracial contexts, and attitudes held about one's own race, about other racial and ethnic groups, and about interacting with one's own and other racial and ethnic groups. The present study examined patterns of sociocultural orientation among academically successful African-American students in the Meyerhoff Program, an intensive, multi-faceted program focused on promoting minorities in the fields of math, science, and engineering. Coping strategies are constituent parts of larger patterns of sociocultural orientation. The current study also examined what types of specific coping strategies are exhibited among the Meyerhoff students, and whether they differ by gender. Data were collected from 115 Meyerhoff students at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. Measures of sociocultural orientation, academic and social integration, minority status stressors, and precollege interracial exposure and experience were administered during a Meyerhoff program meeting. A subsample of 34 Meyerhoff students participated in follow-up, in-depth interviews. The results indicated that the majority of Meyerhoff students were exhibiting a general pattern of movement between the Black and White cultural realms; seven distinct patterns of sociocultural orientation were exhibited by students in the interview subsample. Students exhibiting a pattern of movement away from both cultures appeared to experience difficulties in psychological, academic and social functioning. Additional relationships were found between certain predictors (gender, precollege interracial exposure and experience) and college-related correlates (minority status stressors), and components of sociocultural orientation.

At two times during the first semester they completed measures of social support, network orientation and adaptation to college. Information about Grade Point Average (GPA) for the following term and attendance at the University one year later were also obtained. Racial composition of high school had some affect on social support at the university: Students from integrated and mainly Black high schools reported more social support satisfaction than students from mainly White high schools, but students from mainly Black high schools reported higher level of Mistrust of social support. Adaptation to college was not affected by racial composition of high school. Multiple regression analyses predicting adaptation to college, GPA, and attendance one year later revealed that adaptation to college was predicted by satisfaction with social support, a less negative network orientation, and less stress prior to entering the university. GPA was predicted by less stress and living at home. Attendance at the university one year later (retention) was predicted by GPA, adaptation to college, smaller network size, higher family income, and living on campus.

Ss were asked to recall information embedded in stories that were either consistent or inconsistent with cultural stereotypes of lighter- versus darker-complexioned African Americans. Children were given measures of interracial attitudes, self-perceived skin tone, skin tone selection, and classification skill. Results show that children show better memory for stereotypic than counterstereotypic information about skin tone. Individual differences in the extent to which this memory bias was evident varied in relation to children's (1) endorsement of negative majority culture views of African Americans and (2) self-ratings of skin color. Implications for understanding racial attitude and identity development, and implications for the design of multicultural programs for African American, as well as Euro-American, children are discussed.

There was an overall effect, in the negative direction, of transracial adoption on a combined variable of racial/ethnic identity and self-esteem. The effect size increased when racial identity was considered separately. Effect size associated with self-esteem was not statistically significant, although a positive direction was noted.

And third, the author makes some observations about what has been learned about the process of interracial schooling from recent research. G. Allport (1954) argued that there are 3 aspects of contact situations that are particularly important in determining whether positive intergroup relations are likely to develop. These aspects are (1) equal status within the context of the situation, (2) an emphasis on cooperative activities within that situation, and (3) the very clear support of authorities in the situation for positive, equal-status relationships. The author discusses these aspects, as well as the color-blind approach to support by authorities.

Authored Book",,"(from the publicity materials) The author explores the issue of racial identity development and a variety of issues at the core of racism and prejudice. Through anecdotes about her own children, excerpts from research interviews she has conducted and essays written by her students, as well as clearly synthesized summaries of the work of eminent social scientists and other scholars, the author presents compelling evidence that suggests that we must all examine our racial identities-whatever they are-if true social change is to take place.
(from the jacket) The author explains that all of us have a racial identity and must strive to affirm it. For people of color, the development of a constructive racial identity requires being able to recognize and reject the bombardment of negative stereotypes and to embrace a history of resistance and empowerment rather than passive victimization. For Whites, the challenge is to engage in a process of racial identity development which leads to an awareness of White privilege and a determination to actively work against injustice-and this requires the strength to reject a system that rewards them, and to reclaim the legacy of White allies. The author extends her ideas about racial identity development beyond the usual Black-White paradigm to embrace the unique circumstances of Latinos, American Indians, Asians, as well as biracial youth. Also included is a list of resources for further reading as well as a list of books for parents and teachers to recommend to children of all ages.

In particular, the authors examine the allegedly race-neutral ideology used by lawyers, judges, and forensic mental health professionals in custody decisions involving interracial families, summarize the outcomes resulting from application of that ideology, and then analyze those results in terms of J. Helms' (1995) racial identity theory. They argue that there would be a value in applying racial identity notions in family law issues and that to do so would require as well that such ideas be introduced in legal training. The authors think a psychologically based race consideration (i. e., racial identity) has merit and should replace the hidden and unstated use of race as a factor. The chapter utilizes the Supreme Court's decision in Palmore v. Sidoti in 1984 to illustrate these ideas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"socioracial factors & J.

They argue that tension between these 2 perspectives takes characteristically different forms in different types of interracial relationships.

The central finding was that the extent of social isolation experienced in life (e.g., lack of direct interracial exposure, lack of intimate exposure to institutions of social power and authority) shaped the capacity to articulate an importance for race in these issues. Thus, while each of the men maintained some of the attributes associated with ""the crisis of the Black male"" (e.g., lack of consistent employment, involvement in illicit activity, incarceration), their capacity to form contrasting conceptions of the importance of race indicated a crucial dimension of variability in what might initially appear to be a cluster of similar individuals. It is argued that an acknowledgment of the bases for such variability is critical for any attempt at remedial intervention in their lives.

Using quantitative and qualitative methods, the extent and character of the portrayal of Blacks and Black-White interaction between 1937 and 1993 is described. Results indicate the portrayal of Black characters over time is nonlinear and can be divided into reasonably distinct phases: declining representation from the late 1930s through the late 1950s, nearly zero representation from that point through 1964, a dramatic increase from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, and a leveling off after 1975. The depiction of intimate, egalitarian, interracial interaction and the portrayal of Black adults as focal characters are rare. Findings also suggest that gains in multicultural portrayals have not been maintained consistently across the different sets of children's books, with prize-winning books more likely to depict Blacks. These trends are linked to gatekeeping activities and to strains in Black-White relations in the larger society. When African American challenges to the dominant societal norms are strongest, Blacks virtually disappear from U.S. children's picture books.

It was found that a combination of high levels of racial segregation followed by interracial contact generates racial competition, which increases the rate of ethnic and racial unrest. In cities where residential contact between African Americans and Whites increases, the rate of race riots increases significantly. A prior history of racial turmoil increases the likelihood of another race riot; the results suggest that the rate of race riots in a metropolitan area depends nonmonotonically on the number of previous riots in that region. These effects remain potent in models controlling for population size, income disparity, ethnic diversity, Black poverty rate, unemployment, and minority composition.

Interview findings on their racial self-definition, attitudes to their mixed parentage, and allegiance to Black and White people and cultures reveal a wide range of racial identities and cultural allegiances. Differences are related to type of school, social class, and the degree of politicization of the young person's attitudes to race. The findings are discussed in relation to the issue of interracial adoption and fostering, and to recent debates about the concept of an ""essential"" Black identity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Ecological competence was assessed longitudinally in 88 African-American transracial adoptees (TRAs). Relations were examined among measures of family racial socialization (FRS), Africentric, and Eurocentric reference group orientations, transracial adoption stressors, and the effects on psychological adjustment. Longitudinal path analyses assessed the relations among these constructs. Path analytic models indicated that in childhood (Time 1) FRS predicted neither Africentric reference group orientation (ARGO) nor Eurocentric reference group orientation (ERGO); by adolescence (Time 2), FRS predicted ARGO but not ERGO. Both ARGO and ERGO contributed significantly to adjustment. Change models indicated that adjustment declined significantly over the 10 yrs. There were multiple determinants of this decline. TRAs experienced difficulty becoming ecologically competent in both ARGO and ERGO. They displayed greater ERGO than ARGO. Discriminant function analyses based on the independent variables yielded hit rates of 71% at Time 1 and over 84% at Time 2 for classifying the TRAs as adjusted or maladjusted.

Authored Book",,"(from the jacket) Today's mental health clinicians face a rapidly changing clientele. Divorce, remarriage, multiracial marriages, different types of adoption, openly gay and lesbian relationships-all have significantly altered the nature and composition of families. At the same time, clinicians within managed care organizations have less contol over the types of cases that make up their practice. This . . . volume is designed to help practitioners work effectively with diversity in this challenging new environment. It confronts myths and stereotypes about what is considered ""normal"" and what constitutes a ""family,"" . . . examines a range of healthy families with creative family structures, and expands our notions about how families work. Synthesizing the current literature with information obtained through 1st-person interviews, the book begins with an overview of contemporary family forms. Chapters then provide an in-depth examination of 3 types of families: adoptive, gay and lesbian, and multiracial. Each is considered first in sociocultural context, then from a developmental perspective, and finally with an eye to treatment implications. This volume is intended for practitioners, both novice and experienced. Also, for graduate students and trainees . . . , this book serves as [a] text for courses in counseling and clinical psychology, social work, psychiatric nursing, family therapy, and psychiatry.

Whether in works by African-Americans, most notably popular music, film, and to a growing degree, TV programs, or works about African-Americans from documentaries to news coverage-strong images pervade our public consciousness. ""Mediated Messages and African-American Culture"" is the 1st book to examine these images and messages as a whole. Bringing together works by leading scholars, this collection examines such vital topics as the relationship between Black men and the police, the state of the African-American press, and the perpetuation of images of African-Americans as poor, violent, and undereducated. Timely case studies and the combination of theory and practice make this text both up-to-date and thorough in its analysis of the image and portrayal of African-Americans in the media. [This book] will be of great interest to students who study popular culture, Black popular culture, African-American history, and the media.

It comprises two parts: a written questionnaire which sampled 122 students, and interviews of six focus groups and nine individuals. This study finds that despite a diverse campus context which emphasizes multiculturalism, interracial friendships are low, but increase the less intimate the relationship. So while students have few interracial close friendships, the majority have weekly interracial contact. Culture emerges as a key shaper for both the meanings and content of friendships. A major developmental factor drawing students to same race friendships is the process of identity formation. Ethnic identity issues are particularly salient for Asian students. Students therefore self-segregate within comfort zones and ethnic spaces as they are attracted to those similar and repulsed from those different.

Developing an understanding of the perception of friendships and peer relationships held by biracial children is particularly important given that social relationships may be more complicated for them than for monoracial children. Participants in this study were girls between the ages of 8 and 11. This study compared the friendship and peer relationship perceptions of monoracial (African American) and biracial African American-Caucasian girls. Participants (N = 25) were interviewed using the Cornell Interview of Peer and Friends (CIPF). Their mothers filled out a short racial identity/demographics questionnaire. It was hypothesized that biracial girls face a more complex developmental process than monoracial girls, and thus more difficulties in the areas of friendship and peer relationships. The quantitative analysis found no differences between monoracial and biracial girls on CIPF overall scores. Biracial girls received higher scores on the subscale Developmental Appropriateness, indicating more maturity in this area. In addition, biracial girls reported a more stable experience of themselves with all friends and more general satisfaction with their friendships than did monoracial girls. Other differences were found between participants classified as higher income versus those classified as lower income. Higher income participants received healthier overall scores on the CIPF. They also indicated that it was easier to get children to play with them and they had less negative interactions with their peers. A qualitative analysis revealed a thoughtful and insightful understanding of friendship for both monoracial and biracial girls. Participant mothers also gave cogent accounts of addressing race related issues with their daughters. Results indicated a similar developmental pattern for monoracial and biracial girls and suggested that bi (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"friendship patterns & peer relations, 8-11 yr old African American vs African American-Caucasian girls","*Friendship

The relationship of physical appearance and self-esteem was also investigated. Scales used included: The Buxenbaum Biracial Identity Interview, the Buxenbaum Biracial Identity Questionnaire, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (Coopersmith, 1975), and a Physical Appearance Scale, modified from the Spivey Physical Descriptions & ""First Impression"" Categorical Descriptions (Spivey, 1984). Data from 26 biracial adults ranging in age from 18-55 were collected and analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Qualitative analysis employed grounded theory procedures (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) and quantitative analysis used repeated measures ANOVA, product moment correlations, point biserial correlations, and interrater reliability. Results suggested that biracial identity is a developmental process which is fluid in character across time and situations. Also observed, were the existence of different public and private racial identities for 36% of subjects, black public and private racial identities for 36% of subjects, and biracial public and private racial identities for 28% of the subjects. Several conclusions can be made from these findings. The most important seems to be that recognition of racial identity appears to be a multilevel process. Another conclusion is that there remains a large area of study in regard to the process of racial identity development in general, and that of biracial and multiracial individuals in particular. Limitations of the study, implications for practice and recommendations for future research are discussed.

In the present study, levels of culturally-congruent and culturally-incongruent Anglo American and African American knowledge, prior and present exposure to Anglo American culture, and perceptions of campus interracial climate (interdependence, supportive norms, and equal status dimensions) were the culture-specific and contextual variables. Academic competence variables were SAT scores obtained (OSAT) during the administration of this study, self-reported verbal and total Scholastic Assessment Test (SSAT) scores, and college grade point averages (GPA). The hypotheses of this study were that for African American undergraduate participants attending a predominantly Anglo American university: (a) eight cultural knowledge subscales would predict the academic competence indicators; (b) prior and present exposure to Anglo Americans would predict academic competence indicators when cultural knowledge variables were controlled; (c) prior and present Anglo American cultural exposure would predict campus interracial climate when cultural knowledge variables were controlled, and (d) campus interracial climate would predict academic competence indicators when culture-specific variables (i.e., cultural knowledge and Anglo cultural exposure) were controlled. The sample consisted of 165 African American undergraduates who completed an abbreviated verbal SAT and a questionnaire packet including measures of the previously described constructs during the course of the study. As hypothesized, the findings revealed that (a) cultural knowledge significantly predicted obtained SAT and self-reported verbal SAT scores; (b) exposure to Anglo American culture significantly predicted OSATs and total SSATs; and (c) exposure to Anglo culture significantly predicted campus interracial climate when cultural knowledge was controlled.

The interviews were conducted entirely in the Thai language in order to allow the participants to share their experiences freely. Three developmental stages of the women's experience arose from the data. These were (1) contemplating marriage, (2) adjusting to marriage, and (3) reflecting on one's marriage and needs. Within each of the three stages a major theme emerged: finding a good husband, carrying on the marriage, and considering options. Several topics related to these themes were also identified in the study. The data are discussed in relation to developmental, symbolic interaction, and social exchange theories.

This phenomenological research method delineates ego formation, presenting transracial adjustment and behavioral issues as described and expressed by the co-researchers of this study. In this research, the essence of the phenomena being studied are the core meanings which underlie interpretations of the experiences of the co-researchers. These are the significant elements of the experience of Korean transracial adoptees. Although each interpretation is unique, generalization becomes possible because within every experience there exists a universal truth. Explored are the factors that influence ego development, identity and adoption adjustment, as well as emotional and behavioral patterns. Besides semi-structured interviews, all of the co-researchers completed an in depth survey addressing internal and external modes of behavior reflective of self-esteem, self worth, identity and behavioral issues. Projective testing was also administered to the seven to ascertain personality and behavioral characteristics. All the interviews were recorded, transcribed, and synthesized into textural essays. In order to identify the essential emergent themes of ego development, identity formation and adoption adjustment during transracial adoptions, content analysis is utilized. Themes relating to the phenomena of transracial adoption include the following for the children: meaning of adoption, being adopted and being Korean, prejudices, family, being different/special, self, character traits, coping style, biological (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"adjustment characteristics & ego formation, 5-11 yr old transracial Korean adoptees & their adoptive parents","*Adjustment

The viability of competing models of conversational participation, the role of local factors in the assignment of reception roles and the relation between such factors and more stable aspects of participant identity (micro-macro link) are considered. Following a review of theoretical and empirical work on participation structure and person deixis in multiparty contexts and a discussion of the qualitative-quantitative-qualitative analytic approach adopted, the relative merits of product- and process-oriented approaches are explored. While a textual analysis in terms of configurations (operationally defined as stretches of talk during which mutual alignment in interlocutory roles is maintained) was found to provide insights into interactional asymmetries linked to the social roles of therapist-client(s) and husband-wife, it is argued that a dynamic analysis is necessary to illuminate how such asymmetries are interactively constituted. On the basis of an examination of turn formatting and dysfluencies, arguments are advanced in favor of a conversation analytic approach focusing on the impact of local linguistic factors on reception-role assignment. Levinson's (1988) revised version of Goffman's (1988) participation framework model was utilized to investigate the sequential effects of pronominal and nominal address and mention. Second-person address was found to be a more effective technique for next-speaker selection than exclusion through third-person mention; names were more effective than pronouns. Functions of indirect targetting and other-quotation are also discussed. Differences in participation were found to be partially attributable to differences in the frequency and range of use of person deictics.

Parenting was conceptualized as a process that includes nourishing, protecting, and guiding the child through the course of development. The methodology was based on the process of heuristic inquiry as described by Moustakas (1990). Heuristics refers to a process of internal search through which one discovers the nature and meaning of experience and develops methods and procedures for further investigation and analysis. The participants were ten married couples who were adoptive parents of Romanian children. They were recruited through contacting support group members and through my personal network. Individual depictions were derived from personal interviews, journal notes, and personal documents, and were then validated by the participants. Data analysis revealed a number of core themes which dictated the quality of the parenting experience. Bonding was an area of concern, with mothers generally reporting bonding more readily than fathers, and those who made the trip to Romania reporting restraining any feelings of attachment until the legal process was completed. All parents, both first-time parents and experienced parents, felt unprepared for the more involved parenting required. Finally, parents of children who exhibited difficult behaviours attributed negative behaviours to the child's genetic background. Parents of children who did not exhibit difficult behaviours attributed positive behaviours to either a mix of heredity and the adoptive environment or due largely to the adoptive environment. Data synthesis showed that at the core of the experience, parenting an adopted Romanian child is not unlike parenting any child, except that it is perhaps more involved parenting. This study provided new meanings of the parenting experience for the participants, for the researcher, for other adoptive parents, and for professionals working in the field (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"experiences related to adoption, married couples who have adopted Romanian children","*Adoptive Parents

The individual variables that this author expected to influence the way an individual appraises and emotionally reacts to an interracial conflict encounter were: (a) level of White racial identity development; (b) level of conservatism; and (c) goal relevance. More specifically, the study was designed to explore the variability in White individual's appraisal of threat, blame and their perceived emotional intensity in response to a hypothetical interracial conflict encounter. It is hoped that the results of this study will be useful in increasing the effectiveness of cultural sensitivity courses, thereby contributing to decreased prejudice and greater racial awareness among Whites in the United States. A total of 90 Caucasian respondents participated in this study by filling out a questionnaire package and responding to an interracial conflict encounter vignette. A Step-Wise Hierarchical Multiple Regression analyses was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results of this study gave support to the hypothesis that after controlling for background variables, the total effect of White racial identity development, level of conservatism and goal relevance accounted for a significant amount of the explained variance in the cognitive appraisal of threat in response to an interracial conflict encounter. Although not significant in the initial analyses, exploratory results of this study gave support to the hypothesis that the individual predictor variables also explained variance in the cognitive appraisal of blame in response to an interracial conflict encounter.

When these samples were combined, regression analyses suggested that higher support from peers, family and school as well as satisfaction with support predicted lower alienation. Peer, family and support satisfaction were also related to higher self esteem and psychological well-being. In terms of racial identity, pre-encounter attitudes predicted higher alienation, psychological distress, and lower self esteem. Internalization attitudes predicted positive functioning in these areas. A positive interracial climate, particularly equal status among Black and White students, predicted lower alienation. Contrary to expectations, neither peer or school support nor interracial climate uniquely predicted intention to graduate or GPA.

Specifically, this study tests social exchange theory by proposing two models, (1) uncertainty reduction and (2) power that explain how clients may assess rewards and costs from communication with counselors. Subjects first completed the Predisposition Toward Counseling Scale. Scenario/scripts consisting of one of four possible conditions: (1) same culture for counselor client/direct counselor communication style, or (2) same culture/indirect communication style, or (3) different culture/direct communication style, or (4) different culture/indirect communication style were used as treatment stimuli.

Subjects then evaluated the counseling interaction by responding to the Counselor Evaluation Inventory and the Interpersonal Communication Satisfaction Inventory.

Results revealed no significant interactions between clients' predispositions toward counseling, cultural composition of the counselor-client dyad, and counselor communication style.

As social interactions among members of various ethnic groups have increased, so too have the number of mixed-heritage couples. Consequently, there are now many more children of mixed heritage in our country than ever before, and their number is likely to increase. These children have traditionally been viewed by the larger society, and presented in the social science literature, as disturbed, maladjusted or inherently pathological. The purpose of this study was to explore from a phenomenological perspective mixed-heritage children's perceptions about themselves and their heritage. This study attempted to provide a better understanding of mixed-heritage children, by asking them directly about their perceptions and experiences. Using a case study qualitative method, data was gathered through in-depth interviews with twelve children of mixed heritage. A triangulation strategy was used for the data analysis in the search for patterns, categories and themes among participants' responses. There were three major findings of this study. It was found that participants have positive perceptions of themselves and their mixed-heritage. It was found that participants feel that they are sometimes perceived by others in negative and stereotypical ways. It was also found that participants value the role of their family in coping with the larger society. In addition, it was found that participants have experienced racism to different degrees and that some of them have experienced extended family tension because of their parents' mixed-heritage marriage. Participants attributed several advantages to their mixed heritage, including: (1) an ability to see things from different perspectives, (2) being open-minded to different people and situations, and (3) being able to bridge cultures. Some of the participants identified religion and language as key values of their families.

This study examines racial identification and its relationship to self concept among transculturally adopted Korean women. Participants for this study (N = 62) were Korean-born women between the ages of 16-43 who were adopted as children by Caucasian families in the United States. It was hypothesized that racial identity and self concept would be significantly positively related for this sample. Two measures of racial identity were included in this study: the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992), a continuous scale of mono-cultural ethnic orientation, and the Racial Identity Attitudes Scale (Helms & Parham, 1985), a categorical measure of stages of racial identity that taps both majority and minority mono-cultural orientation, as well as biculturalism. The Tennessee Self Concept Scale (Fitts, 1964) was used to measure personal identity or self concept. The results, using Pearson product-moment correlations, multiple regressions, and discriminant function analyses, indicate that there is a significant correlation between self concept and racial identity, but only when measured by an instrument (the Racial Identity Attitudes Scale) that taps bi-cultural orientation. Bi-cultural orientation was related to higher self concept than either minority or majority focused mono-cultural orientation in this sample. Additionally, it was shown that, on the whole, participants in this study held bi-cultural orientations and were interested in their ethnic/racial identity. Whereas participants in this study had lower physical and behavioral self concept scores than the original normative sample, they had higher self satisfaction and personal identity scores. This finding suggests that adoptees in this sample may have felt self conscious about some aspects of their physical appearance, but tended to feel satisfied wi (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"racial identity development & self concept, 16-43 Korean women adopted as children by Caucasian families","*Adoptees

Krippendorff's (1980) content analysis procedures, a total of 260 college courses and professional training programs in intercultural communication from 9 cross-cultural education and training categories (intercultural communication, language and culture, international/global communication, human relations, interethnic/interracial, cultural diversity, multicultural education, cross-cultural psychology, and cross-cultural research) were analyzed on the basis of goals, content, and methods. A majority (88%) of both types of programs were judged as integrating multidimensional goals (cognitive, affective, and behavioral), content (culture general and culture specific) and process (intellectual and experiential). The results of the analysis suggest that while some practitioners still maintain a unidimensional focus in their cross-cultural training and education activities, the majority of them prefer teaching and learning strategies that are multidimensional.

Ss were 292 White adults participating in the 1991 Oklahoma City Survey. Findings showed that childhood interracial contact in schools and neighborhoods not only disconfirmed negative racial stereotypes, but had a direct, significant effect on levels of adult antiblack prejudice even controlling for other relevant factors. Results suggest continued support for the desegregation of American schools and neighborhoods as a means of promoting more positive racial attitudes through interracial contact.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The positive and negative effects of one's school environment (and interracial contact within this environment) have been widely debated. A question of great concern is whether the racial composition (e. g., school environment) of a school affects one's self-esteem. The present study explored whether self-esteem, race-esteem, school commitment, and delinquency differ by the racial composition of a school. Self-report questionnaires were administered to a random sample of 1,100 high school students"" in a large midwestern city of the United States. The findings (a) suggest that all four measures differ by school environment, and (b) provide partial support for earlier studies claiming that, within racially homogeneous school environments, African American students, in particular, enjoy higher self-esteem. Moreover, this finding might suggest that racial diversity within certain school environments (e.g., mostly Caucasian or equally mixed) carries with it lower levels of self-esteem. Higher rates of self-reported delinquency, however, were found in the equally mixed school environment than in racially homogeneous school environments.

The relationship between self and other is frequently mediated through projection and identification. This article examines this unique interracial and interethnic therapeutic dyad emphasizing its clinical implications through the attribution of otherness, the use of colored screen projection, and the significance of power reversal. Special emphasis is given to the prevalent transferential and countertransferential reactions aided by clinical material. It is concluded that this therapeutic dyad provides a model for cross-cultural encounters where the resolution of contradictions can lead to the recognition of paradoxes, the acknowledgment of ambivalence, and the acceptance of disparate parts of the self. The management of ethnocultural transference and countertransference in the therapist of color and the White patient dyad can provide a model for dealing with cultural diversity and divergent worldviews.

The investigation tests hypotheses about the process by which these two factors operate, as well as differentiating between Black and person-of-color identities. Data were drawn from the National Survey of Black Americans (J. S. Jackson and G. Gurin, 1987) which surveyed 2,107 17-101-yr-olds. Evidence was found to support claims that interracial contact in childhood weakens adult feelings of closeness to other Blacks. Mixed support for the impact of parental socialization emerged once a more precise definition of identity was employed. With respect to process, insufficient support was found for the claim that childhood factors affect closeness through Black culture and outgroup orientation. The article concludes by outlining arguments regarding the merits of Black identity and calling for research to help resolve this controversy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"One of the most serious criticisms of research on the contact hypothesis is the contention that selection bias operates to promote interaction between Whites and Blacks who are already relatively unprejudiced toward one another. Accordingly, attempts to infer the effect of interracial contact on racial attitudes must recognize and correct for this potential source of bias. Endogenous switching regression models are used to estimate the effect of close interracial friendship on selected racial attitude variables while accounting for possible selectivity bias. Each model implies a distinct assumption about the process generating interracial contact and racial attitudes. Using data from the National Survey of Black Americans (J. S. Jackson et al, 1987; n = 2,107), the authors find no evidence of sample selection bias in estimating the effect of close interracial contact on black racial attitudes. Therefore, they do not reject the conventional models used in research on the contact hypothesis that treat interracial contact as an exogenous variable affecting racial attitudes. However, results show the usefulness of a switching regressions approach to reveal the contingent nature of the contact hypothesis.

Forensic psychiatrists have said little about this form of transracial adoption, and they seem willing to allow other disciplines to map out single-handedly the public policy in this area. This policy is expected to affect an estimated 175,000 Black children nationally who live in some form of out-of-home placement. Forensic psychiatrists should increase their understanding of and involvement in the debate over this special form of adoption. Several principles are highlighted that must be better understood if forensic psychiatrists are to participate in the debate with clarity and understanding.

Thirty-one Black-White biracial adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 served as subjects in this within-group design. The variables assessed were: (a) the strength of biracial ethnic identity, (b) the self-label the adolescent used for ethnic identification, (c) the level of adaptive functioning, and (d) the racial composition of the adolescent's environment. The two predictor variables for the dependent variable of adaptive functioning were the strength of biracial ethnic identity and the self-label of the adolescents. The predictor variable for the dependent variable of ethnic self-label was the racial composition of the biracial adolescent's environment. Adaptive functioning was assessed by the Roberts Apperception Test for Children, ethnic identity and self-label were assessed by the Multiethnic Identity Measure, and the racial composition of the adolescent's environment was assessed by the questionnaire. Prior to hypothesis testing, intercorrelations found that no significant relationships existed between SES, age, the Biracial Multiethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), and the Roberts Apperception Test for Children (RATC) data at the.05 level of significance. The results of the simple Pearson correlation between the data from the Biracial MEIM and the RATC adaptive scales were not significant. In a post hoc analysis of the 3 MEIM's (Black, White and Biracial) it was found that the Black MEIM and the White MEIM significantly correlated with the RATC subscale, Resolution, and the total RATC adaptive scale. The results of a t-test found that a significant difference was not found between the Black and Biracial MEIM on the adolescent's self-label.

The major relationship variables under investigation were love, attachment style, intimacy, communication, investment, commitment, and adjustment. The sample consisted of 22 same-race White couples, 15 same-race Black couples, and 15 Black-White interracial couples, between the ages of 21 and 65 years, who were either married or in long-term monogamous relationships. This study utilized the Love Attitudes Scale, Attachment Style Measure, the PAIR Inventory, the Marital Communication Inventory, Investment and Commitment Scales, and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of 5 Black-White interracial couples in order to assess the qualitative experience of being in an interracial marriage. The findings revealed no significant main or interaction effects between the racial composition groups on the relationship variables of love, attachment style, communication, investment and commitment. Significant main effects were found for racial composition on the variables of Social Intimacy, Recreational Intimacy, and Dyadic Cohesion. Same-race White couples were found to be significantly higher than same-race Black couples on all three variables, and significantly higher than Black-White interracial couples on Social Intimacy. A significant interaction effect between racial composition and gender was found on the love style Pragma which suggested females from the same-race White group and males from the same-race Black group tended to be higher on the love style Pragma than males and females from other racial composition groups.

Exploration into the empirical relationship between stages of biracial identity development and perceived alienation was investigated in a sample of 83 biracial (African-American/Caucasian) adults living in Southern California. Subjects were recruited from local and college newspapers. Subjects had the option of completing a questionnaire through the mail or by telephone. The development of the BIDI consisted of establishing a theoretical base and item pool, having experts rate the items, administering the scale, and running statistical analyses. The five subscales included: Lack of Salience, Conflict, Monoracial Identification, Appreciation, and Interaction. Lack of Salience and Conflict exhibited ""respectable"" internal-consistency reliability scores. A non-experimental method with a correlational and cross-sectional design was utilized. Alienation included the constructs Normlessness, Powerlessness, and Social Isolation. The investigator hypothesized that people at different levels of the biracial identity development stages would differ in Normlessness, Powerlessness, and Social Isolation scores and that the biracial identity subscales would account for a significant portion of the explained variance in Alienation. Results suggest that biracial adults who are high vs. low on the Conflict and Monoracial Identification subscales of biracial identity significantly varied in the degrees of Alienation experienced. Subjects with higher Conflict scores had higher Powerlessness scores, while subjects with higher Monoracial Identification scores had higher Social Isolation scores. However, the low reliability on the Monoracial Identification subscale indicates that these results need to be interpreted cautiously. Appreciation approached significance with individuals higher in Appreciation experiencing less Social Isolatio (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"development & quantitative examination of Biracial Identity Development Inventory (BIDI), relationship between biracial identity development & alienation, African-American/Caucasian adults","*Adult Development

Previous research on children's coping has been limited in addressing cultural variables which mediate coping responses, and a pathology-driven model has typically been used to explain African-American children's reactions to stress. Fifty African-American school-aged children completed a variety of stress, coping and racial identity measures and participated in an in-depth interview to test the hypotheses that children with negative racial attitudes would demonstrate fewer effective coping mechanisms, competent behavior, and would be more influenced by racial context than those with a positive racial identity. Further, it was expected that children's perception of control would influence both the number and variety of coping styles utilized in stressful encounters, and that those holding an internal locus of control would exhibit an increased capacity to distinguish effective coping. Results obtained showed that children who held an internal locus of control displayed greater variability in coping strategy use, were more effective in distinguishing effective coping in interracial situations; and were less likely to utilize the emotion-focused strategy of distancing. Research hypotheses concerning the role of racial identity and racial influences affecting coping style, competency, and effectiveness were not supported. This appeared to be related to the instrument used and the manner in which children were classified racially, as further analyses revealed a relationship between racial identity stage and ability to distinguish effective coping. The findings suggest the need to continue to investigate and support the development of intervention strategies which increase African-American children's internalized beliefs in their abilities and capacity to (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"cognition & locus of control & racial socialization & choice of coping strategy & competence, poor African American school-aged children","*Cognition

This monoracial categorization has become a visible symbol that acts as a foundation for a much wider array of experiences and situations in our schools and communities which affect the racial self-image of multiracial children. This incomplete categorization affects awareness and funding for supportive measures which should be available to them. The basic question which this dissertation raises is the question of whether the needs of interracial children are being met in the schools. In order to study this question, the school's racial categorization procedures as predominant cultural forms were investigated by way of its instruments--school forms, curriculum, resources, cultural programming and school material culture. In order to answer these questions, this inquiry utilized predominantly two methods of data collection: (1) documentation analysis of government and school forms and (2) semi-structured interviews with teachers as key informants. To establish a focus for the direction of the research, a theory of radical pedagogy was used to critically analyze the role of the schools in fostering or obstructing a more positive racial identity in interracial children and a theory of classification to provide a framework to analyze both the nature and language of our racial categorization procedures and its' instruments in the schools. This dissertation found that the schools do unknowingly make the normal racial identity development process problematic for at least some of those students who might want to select more than one racial identity. Multiracial children's invisibility in the schools' racial categorization procedures mirrors a wider range of their invisibility in school curriculum, books, cultural programs, class (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,racial categorization procedures of schools & self-image of multiracial children,"*Cultural Sensitivity

However, African-Americans and Afro-Canadians state unequivocally that it does continue; and that having to cope with racism negatively affects their sense of self esteem and racial identity. Several studies support the latter's claim (The Human Relations Task Force Report, 1989; Cose, 1993; Essed 1991), as does the present research. In the present study, a semi-structured interview technique was used with 18 African-American and Afro-Canadian professionals to elicit their perceptions of which key and salient variables cause them to label an experience racist. The study queried these individuals' affective responses to racism, the defenses (strategies) they have developed to cope with racism, and sought to determine if any exhibited a ""victim identity"" coping style. Additionally, these professionals were asked to identify any factors they believed would improve race relations in their respective countries and asked what advice they would offer youth to help them cope as adults in an interracial environment. Racism was an experience familiar to all the study's participants. They offered highly consistent definitions of racism and highly similar anecdotal accounts of racist experiences. Participants identified three categories of salient variables/cues they believed denoted racism: (a) shifts or changes in sensory behavioral cues viewed as atypical (socially inappropriate) and negatively affecting them personally; (b) atypical behavior in the service delivery/commercial sector where the Black person receives negative differential treatment; and (c) systemic cues in which the Black person observes practices which keep them at a professional disadvantage to their White colleagues. Finally, participants described intense negative affective responses to racism and identified severa (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,"affective responses to racism & coping style, blacks, US & Canada","*Affection

However, to date, there has been comparatively little research to ascertain the factors which influence the development of such preferences. This study investigates two causal theories that have been proposed to explain the development of preferences, addressing the general question of whether a causal relationship exists between prejudice and the residential preferences of Detroit area whites and blacks. First, an argument is posited that whites' liberal attitudes about living in integrated neighborhoods may be negatively affected by stereotype use. Here, it is also argued that blacks' experiences and perceptions of discrimination induce their aversion to integrating all-white neighborhoods. The results of the two estimated models--the first for whites and the second for blacks--provide convincing evidence that stereotype use mitigates the liberal residential preferences of whites and that blacks' perceptions of discrimination by white homeowners and their anticipation of encountering racial hostility are causally related to their reluctance to pioneer integration. Other substantive findings about the indirect effects of stereotype use and discrimination on the preferences of whites and blacks, respectively, the interrelationships among the findings from the two models, and general methodological and policy issues are also discussed.

M. Gordon's (1964) theory. His theory outlines a seven-stage model of acculturation. During the first stage, individuals increase their participation in and preference for activities of the dominant host culture, rather than their native culture. The next stage involves establishing social relationships with members of other ethnic groups and the host culture. Marital assimilation is the third stage and involves large-scale intermarriage. The process continues to the point where there is an absence of prejudice, discrimination, and value and power conflict in the later stages. The focus of this study was on these first three stages. Additionally, the construct of familism, the degree to which one expresses identification with and attachment toward their family, was examined to understand how this variable relates to the acculturation process and attitudes towards intermarriage. The participants in this study were 161 Cuban undergraduates attending college in South Florida. The students completed instruments that measure the various steps in the acculturation process, social desirability, familism, and attitudes towards intermarriage. Correlational analyses yielded several interesting results. There was a significant positive relationship between the extent to which the participants engaged in Anglo-American cultural activities and positive attitudes towards intermarriage. Additionally, gender differences in attitudes towards intermarriage were found to be significantly related to the students' level of acculturation. As males increase their participation in and preference for activities of the dominant host culture, their positive attitudes towards intermarriage also increase. This relationship was not found with the female students whose attitudes towards intermarriage remain the same across levels of behavioral acculturation.

Particularly prevalent in the adoptee population are antisocial characteristics such as criminality, aggressiveness, youthful pregnancy, and adjustment reactions. Various explanations for this tendency have been posited. The current research focused on the resolution of infertility issues of adoptive parents, and the relationship between such resolution and the willingness to both openly acknowledge the differences between adoptive and biological parenting and to interact with others regarding adoptive issues. It also considered the hypothesis that these adoptive parent experiences and behaviors are related to certain demographic conditions through a mechanism termed ""role handicap"" in past investigations. Adoptive parents of three adoption agencies were asked to respond to a mail questionnaire, which included a demographic section, an acceptance of adoptive reality questionnaire, and a resolution of infertility questionnaire. Confidentiality procedures insured that individual responders would not be identified with their responses. Resolution of infertility was measured with the Adjustment to Infertility Scale. Parental beliefs and behaviors regarding adoptive issues were calibrated on the Adoptive Parenthood Questionnaire. The relationship of resolution of infertility to acceptance of adoptive reality was the measurement of primary concern. Other relationships examined were those of both resolution of infertility and acceptance of adoptive reality to postinfertility stage, gender, religion, religiosity, and differentiating adoptee characteristic (interracial, foreign, and/or handicapped). No significant relationships were obtained for any of the hypothesized relationships. A factor analysis of the Adoptive Parenthood Questionnaire yielded three discrete factors. One of these, the celebration of and voluntary association around adoption, had a significant positive relationship (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,The resolution of infertility and the acceptance of adoptive reality,"*Adoptive Parents

Results do not confirm strong effects of rearing or social environment or age of adoption on IQ, nor can the IQ decline figures be trusted because different tests were used at Time 1 and 2. Correlations with natural and adoptive parent education and IQ measurements are also misconstrued when suggesting no support for the genetic hypothesis, which is in reality strongly supported. Contrary to Weinberg et al's conclusions, results indicate that adoption by White middle-class families has not benefitted the intelligence of Black, interracial, or White children at an average age of 17 yrs. It is suggested that the positive correlations between the IQs of the adoptive parents and those of the Black and interracial adopted children present one anomalous result that should be more fully examined.

Weinberg et al (see record 1992-34580-001), suggesting that hereditarianism is more probable than it was before and environmentalism less probable, implying consistency with the hypothesis that the mean Black/White difference in IQ is significantly genetic in origin. There is evidence that the birth cohort was not genetically typical of the White population. The comparisons most relevant to hereditarianism are between the Black/Black cohort and the birth children and between the Black/Black adoptees and the White cohort. Genotype-environment interaction offers an ordering and rough magnitude of the gaps predicted by hereditarianism. Transracial adoption design can control for a number of environmental variables commonly cited to explain race differences in phenotypic intelligence.

These competition arguments are examined using data on antibusing events, school desegregation, and interracial residential exposure in SMSAs from 1968-1990. Results suggest that the amount of school desegregation significantly raised rates of protests against busing. Furthermore, there is little evidence that the federal origin of court-ordered busing increased antibusing activity.

Edited Book",,"(from the introduction) ""Inside the Mixed Marriage"" is about the personal experiences of people in mixed marriages. . . . Here the marital partners consider the changing sets of advantages and constraints mixed marriages have imposed on them and their children. And, in addition to discussing the impact of society on [their] marriages, [they] speculate on the impact [their] marriages have had on the attitudes of others. It is the view from inside the mixed marriage which makes these [personal] narratives significant. They provide sharp contrasts to those who understand mixed marriages solely in the context of intergroup relations, social control, and social dominance. They hit directly at popular myths and fears. These narratives illustrate the artificiality of social constructs like ethnicity, race and culture.

Measures of perceived normative pressure to hold prejudiced attitudes correlated positively and substantially with Ss' prejudiced attitudes. However, correlations between social pressure and racial prejudice were not due to conformity and probably reflected mechanisms such as socialization and homophilic selection. Conformity proneness also showed little association with overall racial prejudice or deviation from modal prejudice levels.

Reviews the book, Racially Mixed People in America by Maria P. P. Root (Ed.) (see record 1992-97305-000). In this edited volume, Root presents a new paradigm for the emerging multiracial population in America. The call for deconstruction of existing theory and the creation of new paradigms for understanding and investigating the multicultural experience is a major premise of this book. Existing social, political, and theoretical frameworks--based on monocultural, monoracial, linear models of social relations and social identity--have forced biracial individuals to choose one or the other culture and to deny significant parts of their heritage and existence. These models mirror the dichotomous, forced choice schemes of racial classification. This volume seeks to correct these practices and perceptions by presenting alternative approaches to social identity and racial classification based on the incorporation of simultaneous membership and multiple, fluid identities.

Tenzer begins his discussion with the unstartling and uninspiring conclusion that White women have ""various beliefs"" about interracial sexuality, a conclusion no more edifying than stating ""I will or will not leave town tomorrow."" It signifies nothing. A rather anorexic presentation of these data (largely reports of the percentage of his sample's agreement with the validity of belief statements) follows and is coupled with sociocultural commentary by the author that draws on a mixture of sociological theory, psychoanalysis, historical exegesis, and personal opinion. Tenzer's book does achieve a measure of interest when he advances his central thesis that interracial sexual relations have been a pervasive and unacknowledged facet of interpersonal life since Europeans first encountered Africa and the Americas.

Results of parent-child IQ correlations and midparent-child IQ correlations were higher for biological offspring than for adoptive parents; correlations between adoptive parents and their adoptive offspring did not decline. This suggests that biologically related family members tend to resemble each other intellectually more than adoptive members. The pattern of IQ correlations for unrelated siblings suggests that familial environmental influences on IQ decline from childhood to late adolescence.

There is a move afoot by biracial (Black and White) young adult children to claim both parts of their ethnic heritage.

High intraracial reliabilities revealed that people of one race showed equally high agreement regarding the traits of own- and other-race faces. Racially universal appearance stereotypes (the attractiveness halo effect and the babyface overgeneralization effect) contributed substantially to interracial agreement, which was only marginally lower than intraracial agreement. Moreover, similar attention to variations in appearance yielded similar degrees of own- and other-race trait differentiation. When own- and other-race differences in the differentiation of faces on babyfaceness were statistically controlled, differences in trait differentiation were eliminated. Despite the individual impressions of other-race faces, certain racial stereotypes persisted.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) The mission of the conference in Mexico City in June 1990 was to bring together counselors and other human development specialists, including theorists and researchers, to examine the challenges posed by the increasingly diverse Spanish-speaking populations located throughout the Americas. An attempt was made to clarify the roles of helping professionals as mediators and advocates for persons of Latino/Hispanic origin, with particular attention to ethnic/cultural identification and within-group differences. An effort also was made to consider the contribution that indigenous practices make to counseling in Latin America and the social and economic consequences of majority-minority relations in both Latin American and North American cultures. This conference promoted and facilitated important dialogue about the broad issues of community, diversity, communication, and spiritual concerns that affect Latino/Hispanic groups. Indeed, numerous presentations and discussions focused on each of these broad topics; thus, this monograph is organized around these four areas of emphasis.

Contributors also examine how nuclear families accept a nonblood ""relative"" into the family, the best way to raise a special needs child, and the need for adoptees to know the history of their family of origin. Included in the book are sections on developmental issues in adoption, assessment of prospective parents, the preparation of special needs children, adoption research, and legal aspects of adoption.

The S had internalized White prejudices, living an identiy drama and caught in a paroxysm of narcissistic humiliation and despair. Nurturing a White ego idea, the S despised the Black traits in his body and hated his parents. The author notes that the S was, at the time of writing, studying to become a labor mediator so as to give a voice to the voiceless and powerless.

Counselors must develop a positive working relationship with BRC and their families and must help BRC to build their self-esteem as unique individuals by identifying and supporting the children's positive coping mechanisms, abilities, and interests independent of racial heritage.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) America has been the breeding ground of a ""biracial baby boom"" for the past 25 years. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of information regarding how racially mixed people identify and view themselves and how they relate to one another. ""Racially Mixed People in America"" steadily bridges this gap, and offers a comprehensive look at the social and psychological adjustment of multiracial people, models for identity development, contemporary immigration and marriage patterns, and methodological issues involved in conducting research with mixed-race people, all in the context of America's multiracial past and present. Including contributions by ethnohistorians, psychologists, and sociologists, this powerful volume will provide the reader a tool for examining ideologies surrounding race, race relations, and the role of social science in the deconstruction of race. ""Racially Mixed People in America"" is essential reading for researchers and practitioners in cross-cultural studies, psychology, family studies, sociology, and social work.

Students in India and Canada who saw conflict in diversity (CID) most often favored a national religion. In Canada and the US, the CID group least often favored government's neutrality in religious matters and were least encouraging of Native American culture. In Canada, the CID group least often felt that racially segregated neighborhoods stand in the way of racial harmony. In both the US and Canada, the CID group advocated the imposition of English as the national language, opposed interracial marriages, and attributed racial conflict to irreconcilable differences. Despite social and cultural cleavages in India, Indian students appeared to have adopted democratic principles to a greater extent than had Canadians and Americans.

This book on intermarried couples in therapy focuses specifically on interracial and interethnic marriages but excludes inter-religious or interfaith marriages. His goal is to provide theory-based, practical material that can assist therapists and students in helping couples involved in these intermarriages. Unfortunately, very little or very poor editing was done on this book. This is an annoyance to the reader, although it does not interfere with overall comprehension. Despite my criticisms of the book, I think it does have quite a bit to offer the practitioner who treats intermarried couples. This usefulness is heightened by the fact that Ho's book is, to my knowledge, the only one of its kind. His ideas can enlighten the therapist not attuned to ethnic differences in couples. His therapeutic suggestions often provide useful and innovative ideas for treatment.

This study addresses the underlying demographic correlates of interracial marriage as distinct among 7,023 Black women and 7,038 Black men in a western location. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the structural correlates were nearly identical for men and women: the interracially married tended to be younger, more likely to have been married before, and more distant in age from their spouses. Furthermore, persons born in the North (both northeast and north central regions) and in foreign countries were more likely to be married to non-Blacks, which seemingly indicates that moves away from communities of origin to environments that are relatively tolerant regarding race facilitate interracial marriage.

The model includes 5 theoretical constructs: inequality, community wealth, interracial attraction, integration conviction, and school involvement. Analysis of Ss' interview data demonstrated that the more affluent the community, the less welcome the minority students were. This finding is consistent with a conflict perspective that argues that the larger the class disparity, the more likely minorities are to feel unwanted, both in school or in the community at large. According to the model, inequality produces negative interracial attraction and also indirectly determines negative integration conviction through its effect on community wealth.

Intermarried Chinese men and women tended to be older, better educated, and to have better jobs and incomes than average.

These couples must socialize their children to function in the mainstream while coping as a minority group member. Ethnic socialization refers to the communication of an ethnic identity; the necessity of fostering resilience and adaptive coping mechanisms is critical for caste-bound minorities who must function in a world of ambiguity. Existing literature suggests that self-esteem for African-American children is related to personal support and encouragement in the home, but achievement is related to factors outside family socialization. The balance between majority values and African-American culture struck by the presence of a minority agenda becomes the deciding factor for positive vs negative socialization outcomes and overall mental health.

Teens act out a short play and then, through questions provided with each drama, they discuss how the characters in the play dealt with the particular issue. The attention is focused on the characters and the issue rather than the teens themselves. These dramas address challenging subjects: abortion, suicide, child abuse, gangs, home life, drugs, etc. They don't gloss over the realities teens face today; rather they present the issues in a straightforward manner and will encourage your teens to talk about them in the same way.

Practicing family therapists will find that the book presents practical information and guidelines that they can readily use in their work with intermarried couples and families. In the academic arena, a specification of knowledge, techniques, and skills in intermarriage therapy should facilitate the learning process of both undergraduate and graduate students.

Edited Book",,"(from the jacket) In this volume David Brodzinsky, who has conducted one of the nation's largest studies of adopted children, and Marshall Schechter, a noted child psychiatrist who has been involved with adoption-related issues for over forty years, have brought together a group of leading researchers from various disciplines to explore the complex, interdisciplinary subject of adoption. While recent empirical work has shown that adopted children are more vulnerable to a host of psychological and school-related problems compared to their nonadopted peers, and that the rate of referral of adopted children to mental-health facilities is far above what would be expected given their representation in the general population, our understanding of the basis for these problems remains unclear. In this book, theoretical, empirical, clinical, and social policy issues offer new insights into the problems facing parents of adopted children, and especially the children themselves. A comprehensive study, ""The Psychology of Adoption"" will be of interest to child psychiatrists, developmental and clinical psychologists, social workers, social service providers, and adoptive parents.

The immediate crisis occurred when a school system was desegregated, and interracial conflict was exacerbated. After observing the competitive situation in an elementary school classroom, the author and colleagues suggested that students be placed in a jigsaw classroom. This method structured student interactions such that cooperation was required for success and achievement. In responding to an energy crisis, some of the home energy auditors of a gas and electric company were trained to communicate with homeowners about energy conservation, based on strategies of social and cognitive psychology. As a result, these auditors persuaded 60.9% of the homeowners they visited to weatherize their homes, a figure significantly higher than that of the control group.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) ""Black and White in School: Trust, Tension, or Tolerance"" takes a probing, much needed look at interracial relations in one particular school, a paradigm of the urban educational environment. ""Wexler Middle School [a pseudonym] opened amid great fanfare and high hopes,"" the book begins. Desegregation, promoted not only as a necessary corrective, but even as a cure-all for society's racial discord, was the cornerstone of Wexler's establishment as a model school. Dr. Schofield's four-year ethnographic study, documented in this volume, revealed unforseen problems as well as hope that desegregation can benefit both black and white students. This book provides a wealth of information for those interested in the sociology of education, intergroup relations, peer group behavior in early adolescence, educational equity, and desegregation. It offers rich insights for social scientists, administrators, counselors, educators, and community leaders.

Reviews the book, Transracial Adoptees and Their Families: A Study of Identity and Commitment by Rita J. Simon and Howard Altstein (1987). The scientific and political issues that shaped the rise and fall of transracial adoption provide the backdrop for this monograph. The stated purpose of the book was to report the results of the third wave of data collection from a sample of transracially adoptive families in order to answer questions about the long-term effects of transracial adoption on the adoptees and their siblings, about the adoptees' racial identities and self-esteem, and about the strength of the loyalties and commitments the parents and children have toward each other. On the basis of their interviews, the authors concluded that, while permanent inracial placement was preferable, transracial adoption continues to be a viable alternative for Black children that should be explored on a case-by-case basis. The design of the study and measures used in it, however, leave the results open to multiple interpretations. Although the study is longitudinal by design, no inferential statistics were used to link data across the different waves of data collection. Furthermore, the book is silent on critical psychometric issues such as reliability of coding and internal consistency of scales.

The pilot TV program involved an interracial and cross-gender team of skilled young adults, cast in counter-stereotypical roles, who traveled to other planets to solve problems of intergroup conflict. To reduce prejudice, the team of protagonists shared equal status and common goals, they cooperated in a fairly intimate context, and they enjoyed successful outcomes. Evaluation of the program is described. It is argued that TV can be a pathway to peace by creating a sense of world community, promoting intercultural understanding, and impeding the formation of the enemy image.

Authored Book",,"(from the introduction) The heart of this volume is Part II. It reports the results of the third phase of our study of transracial adoption, in which we interviewed 96 parents and 218 children, 111 of whom have been transracially adopted, 91 of whom have been born into the families, and 16 of whom have been adopted. This third phase occurred four and a half years after our last contacts with these families and twelve years after we interviewed them for the first time. . . . In phases one and two, we reported that the parents were optimistic that their children would have integrated and wholesome personalities and the emotional security sufficient to allow them to make their way and gain acceptance among both black and white communities. Rather than becoming the pariahs that the Black Social Workers warned about, these children would also become part of a small but growing integrated community in which race was not a major basis for acceptance or evaluation. Phase three assesses the likelihood that the parents' hopes have and will be realized and that the transracial adoptees are aware of their ""special status"" and capable of coping with it. We begin this volume by providing, in Part I, what statistical data are available on the numbers of transracial adoptions nationally, practices of adoption agencies, and recent court rulings. Part I also discusses the positions of the National Association of Black Social Workers, Child Welfare League, and other agencies, public and private, involved in the placement of nonwhite children. Part III examines alternative forms of adoption such as single parent adoption. It reports the effects of contraceptive practices and abortions among teenagers on birth rates and adoptions; and it provides data and analysis about intercountry adoptions.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Proposes a method for measuring schools' ""interracial climates"" and examines the extent to which variations in these climates are related to schools' racial compositions, rates of change in their racial compositions, and the social and academic status of Black and White students.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In the years immediately following the 1967 racial disorder crisis in Detroit, there existed between black and white community leadership ideological and policy polarization. Over the next decade such polarization transformed itself into a nonideological pragmatic accommodationist orien tation. This analysis draws on Turner's emergent norm theory to interpret stages evident in the normative shift in black and white leadership attitudes and behaviors within a context of continuing stressful city conditions. Employing a combination of decisional, functional, and positional selection criteria, 14 black and 22 white community leaders were periodically interviewed and observed between 1968 and 1980. As posited in emergent norm theory, the crystallization and recrystallization of norms held by black and white community leaders involved multiple competing leadership ideas before a dominant norm emerged. While there are signs that a possible new emergent norm stage of repolarization may be developing, this analysis focuses on the interactionist process that resulted in a shift from interracial community leadership confrontation toward policy and pragmatic cooperation for a period of over a decade.

A triple-order interaction effect extended previous findings by demonstrating that the expression of suffering reduced aggression (a) even if the victim had no power to retaliate and (b) even if the victim was a member of a racial minority. In contrast to the suppressive effect of suffering, potential retaliation was a relatively ineffective deterrent of physical attack. Additional factors limiting the aggression-inhibiting power of threatened retaliation were the victim's expression of suffering and expectations of weak counteraggression.

Classification was based on personal interviews, participant observation, voluntary association in meetings and other groups, and a sociocultural schedule. Strong association was noted between acculturation level and frequency of contact with the Indian community. Another strong indicator was choice of companions. Tradition-oriented women sought out other Indians, whereas the more assimilated tended not to socialize with Indians except for immediate kin. No close correspondence appeared between degree of Indian blood and intermarriage. Degree of individual acculturation appears to depend on several factors, including the influence of the Indian parents, some of whom desire assimilation for their children, and contact with White leaders. Modifying influences include family relationships and personal identification as an Indian, plus 2 factors assuming added importance today: mass media emphasis on freedom in choice of life-style and the Pan Indian movement.

Two theories of interracial sociability were considered. The 1st argues that interracial friendliness is affected primarily by the number of opportunities students have for cross-race interaction relative to same-race interaction; it predicts that students in the numerical minority are likely to make more cross-race friendship choices than those in the majority. The 2nd theory claims that the racial minority is socially threatened by the majority and tends to isolate itself from the more dominant and powerful other race. These predictions were examined over a school year in a longitudinal data set of Ss in 18 desegregated classes. The results of sociometric questionnaires given at 6 time points over the school year provide strong support for the opportunity hypothesis and show little evidence that being in the racial minority diminishes interracial friendliness. Cross-sectional analyses showed that as the proportion of 1 racial group in the classroom increased, the friendlier the Ss of the other race were toward members of that racial group.

The sample was 53% White, 47% Black, 56% male, and 44% female. All classes studied a 10-wk language mechanics curriculum on grammar, punctuation, and English usage. The treatment was composed of an interdependent cooperative-task structure and a cooperative-reward structure that enabled the Ss to learn about each other as individuals. Results support several hypotheses derived from the theory of the strength of weak ties. Friendships between races and sexes tended to be weak rather than strong, and ties between peer groups also tended to be weak. The cooperative-group intervention stimulated new weak ties between students of different race and sex. However, these did not form a bridge between groups but instead were concentrated within existing peer groups. Findings confirm that cooperative groups stimulate new weak ties between individuals of different race and sex but raise doubts about whether this intervention directly improves intergroup relations among preexisting peer groups.

A previous study by the author and H. A.

The present paper reports on the interracial behavior of the previously studied 7th graders as they moved through the essentially segregated 8th grade.

Results indicate no differences in mother-infant attachment between nonadopted and intraracial adopted Ss or between intraracial and interracial adopted Ss. Interracial adoptive mother-infant pairs did show a higher incidence of insecure attachment in comparison to nonadoptive pairs. Mothers of interracial adopted infants also were less comfortable having others care for their babies and perceived less emotional support from extended family and friends for their decision to adopt a child prior to the actual adoption than did other mothers. No relation was found, however, between quality of mother-infant attachment and either perceived social support, infant development quotient, infant temperament, number of foster homes experienced by the infant, or infant's age at the time of adoption placement. It is suggested that the higher incidence of psychological problems found among adoptees in middle childhood and adolescence cannot be explained in terms of insecure attachment relationships during the infancy years.

The analysis showed that the increased exposure of White pupils to Black pupils (or interracial contact) substantially affected the demography of school systems and led to reductions in White enrollment. Moreover, the adverse effect of increased interracial contact was not limited to school districts that had implemented desegregation programs, although these districts experienced an accelerated rate of White enrollment decline. White enrollment losses appeared to be short-term, limited primarily to the year a desegregation program was implemented. Findings imply that White enrollment trends are sensitive not to the programmatic components of desegregation strategies but rather to the amount of change in interracial contact that such strategies bring about.

Friendly interactions, on the other hand, were affected by opportunities for interracial contact within and prior to the high school. Equal status between students of different race was not important in determining positive or negative outcomes of interracial contact.

Embedded in the subject of transracial adoption is one of the key paradoxes of treatment programs: can a service be good for the individual but bad for the group? Or, conversely, good for the group but bad for the individual? Furthermore, can criteria for program evaluation incorporate the variable of time? Good for now but bad for later? In this book, however, Simon and Altstein boldly take on the paradox and try to deal with both interpersonal and policy questions. Not surprisingly, they do not come up with definitive answers, but it is to their credit that the attempt is made. Although they are candid in reporting problem areas, the authors continue to see transracial adoption as a means of helping to counteract the problems of homeless children. They emphasize, however, that their survey is not finished and the answers are not all in. This volume, then, is essentially an interim progress report, bolstered with background information on current adoption issues. It is useful for professionals who wish a balanced current view of issues, and who want current data on continuing research.

Edited Book",,"(from the jacket) It has always been assumed that contact between members of different groups does improve relations between them. Indeed, this view has been the basis of many social policy decisions advocating integration in schools, housing and sports. Yet the reported effects of this contact hypothesis have often been inconsistent. Many studies have failed to find a reduction of prejudice following interracial contact; others have yielded more positive results. Perhaps the most persistent problem is that all too often interpersonal contact fails to reduce intergroup conflict. The contributors to this book assess the contact hypothesis in situations of intergroup encounter. They pay close attention to the durability of positive effects-whether harmony between groups endures-and present an incisive and realistic picture of social-psychological contributions to the reduction of conflict.

The results show considerable support for Blau's theory, suggesting that the general macrostructural framework can be profitably applied to disparate forms of social behavior. Moderate, positive correlations are found between rates of IM and IC. Both IM and IC are influenced significantly by at least 1 of the following social structural conditions: group size, heterogeneity, intergroup inequality, and segregation. However, the effects of social structure vary by the form of association. The rate of IM is positively affected by the degree of racial income equality, whereas IC rates are more strongly influenced by relative group size and racial residential segregation.

This book has 2 major purposes. The first is to illustrate the scope and sophistication of the emerging field known as the social psychology of education. The second is to provide solid, informed suggestions to educators for the amelioration of current educational problems. To that end, each author explicitly discusses implications for educational practice. This book is intended for psychologists and educational researchers.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Investigated the view that racial prejudice among White Americans today is often expressed in subtle, indirect, and rationalizable ways. Whites may therefore regard themselves as unprejudiced and nondiscriminatory as they continue to disadvantage minorities. It was hypothesized that Whites would be less helpful to Blacks only when normative guidelines within the situation suggest that the failure to help would be justifiable and not necessarily inappropriate. However, Whites would not discriminate against Blacks when the failure to help would be clearly inappropriate. In the present experiment, the normative guidelines regarding the appropriateness of helping was varied by manipulating the causal locus of the recipient's need (internal or external) and the source of the helping request (the recipient or a 3rd-party observer). Supportive of the hypotheses, Ss' (130 White female university students) helping behavior discriminated against Black recipients only in the condition in which the recipients' needs were caused by their failure to work hard and the requests were issued by the recipients themselves (i.e., when the failure to help would not be regarded as particularly inappropriate).

Significant group differences were limited to mean achievement test scores and science grades. Achievement scores were significantly related to grades, but classroom behaviors also accounted for a significant and unique portion of the variance. There were no significant relationships between behaviors and other student measures. Teacher ratings of effort, ability, course difficulty, and environment were also acquired. Teachers rated Whites as smarter and believed that Black females exerted the greatest effort and Black males the least. As a secondary interest, number and type of student interactions were recorded. Few hostile interracial encounters were observed, and interactions were predominately within race.

It is argued that the perspectives make divergent predictions about the process and outcomes of interracial interaction, but these predictions have not been tested because of the differing paradigms associated with each perspective's supporting research. An experiment employing pseudo-interracial dyads is reported that appears to resolve some of the competing hypotheses. 70 White undergraduates participated in indirect target-perceiver dyads in which the stated race of the target was varied. In 2 additional phases of the experiment, 6 undergraduates rated the target or both the target and perceiver on the basis of audiotapes. Problems with the procedure suggest that the pseudo-interracial dyads paradigm cannot answer several important questions about Ss' use of stereotypes and responses to requests to evaluate Black targets and lacks external and construct validity.

If this hypothesis is true, the mechanisms by which this effect operates also must be examined. In the analysis, the three aspects of the dissonant school environment were used to explain why Blacks experience lower levels of self-esteem as they come into contact with Whites. A random sample of Black students (grades 3-12) responded to the influence of self-esteem and racial contact. Results reveal that although racial contact does exert a slight effect on self-esteem, in no instance are any of the effects statistically significant.

Edited Book",,"(from the preface) This book was designed to explore in depths what unique experiences and situations that are common to Black children and their parents. The volume was developed within the framework that all children during their childhood-regardless of race, ethnicity, social class, or gender- must complete similar developments tasks if they are to become competent adults. Therefore, the book does not attempt to duplicate the information that will be found in a comprehensive developmental textbook. Instead, it documents how these developmental tasks are uniquely experienced in the environments of children's growth and development.-PP This book has been developed around the themes of the significant environments within the lives of Black children. There are two major assumptions made as this book is developed: One is related to the economic environment of many Black children and the other is related to the negative images that are carried about Black children by members of the wider society. The environments that were selected to be developed in detail are as follows: the theoretical environment; the socioeconomic environment; the educational environment; the parental environment and racial socialization; and the internal environments of children's racial attitudes and self-esteem.

Results indicate general support for the hypotheses, with the biggest differences between the two groups occurring on the sexual items (premarital sex, birth control, abortion, homosexuality, pornography, sex on TV, and satisfaction with own sex life). Differences also appeared on issues related to marriage and the family (divorce, interracial marriage, and sex) and religion. Three questions relevant to women's roles produced contradictory results. Eleven items concerning political and economic issues revealed four significant differences. Here, swingers were more liberal on the legalization of marijuana but more conservative on capital punishment, welfare, and controlling business. Finally, a breakdown on all the items by sex revealed the females to be more satisfied with their friends and their sex life, and the males to be more in favor of the women staying at home.

Each S was purposely overloaded with duties, and the confederate reacted with voluntary help, helping only after comments by the observing experimenter, or no help. Group task outcome was varied by arranging for half the team to experience failure and half to experience success. Ss, who were from small towns and rural areas of the southern US, developed significantly greater respect and liking for a groupmate who helped voluntarily than for one who did not help. Respect and liking for a groupmate who helped because instructed to do so by the experimenter was intermediate. There was a nonsignificant trend for Black helpers to be liked more than White helpers. Both Black and White helpers were liked as well when the group failed in its task as when it succeeded.

Instruments were administered during interviews. Results show that (a) the conceptual and empirical distinctions between symbolic racism and ""old-fashioned"" prejudice have been exaggerated and (b) symbolic racism may be best understood as a symptom of generalized tendencies to derogate out-groups-tendencies associated with a configuration of personal attributes that reflect commitments to conservative sociopolitical values and conventional standards of conduct. Findings are discussed in reference to the persistence of racial prejudice and their implications regarding exposure to and the effects of interracial contact.

J. caniceps dorsalis also fed significantly faster than the other juncos. For both species, feeding rates were approximately the same in large and small mixed-species groups. In larger groups, however, individual grey-headed juncos won conflicts at a higher rate, and individual dark-eyed juncos lost conflicts at a higher rate. Also, dark-eyed juncos fed at a significantly lower rate in groups of grey-headed juncos than in groups of similar size but composed mostly of conspecifics.

Overall, the 2 racial groups were more similar than dissimilar in their sexual behavior patterns. A few differences did emerge. Black males had more interracial coital experience than White males, and White males had more masturbatory experience than Black males. White females, when compared to Black females, were more likely to have performed fellatio, used coitus interruptus, and have masturbated a partner.

Research on Black and White nonverbal behavior reveals that White and Black North Americans show different patterns of eye-gaze, head nodding, and ""back channel"" behaviors. The results of research investigating interracial interaction in educational contexts suggest that both White and Black teachers behave more positively toward members of their own race than toward members of other races and that the nonverbal behaviors of teachers are related to their racial attitudes. The mere presence of a White or Black student may be sufficient to evoke the nonverbal behaviors associated with particular attitudes. Teachers should be aware of the fact that students of different races may possess differing communicative codes and of the likely nature of such differences. Teachers should also be aware of their own attitudes and behavior and those situations in which they are likely to display negative behaviors.

Items addressed basic demographic data (including professional life), interracial interactions, and current job characteristics. Analysis revealed that White Ss born in the US represented as little as 15% of the faculty. Factor analysis (using data from 81 Ss) yielded 10 dimensions of experience and adjustment. The majority of Ss felt they were socially accepted, had a personal commitment to the goals of the college, were limited in their career advancement, worked under a more rigid administration than would be experienced at a White college, could discuss racial differences with Blacks, and had difficulty separating subjective feelings related to racial disadvantage in grading. Tenured Ss were significantly less likely than nontenured Ss to feel socially accepted and comfortable with administrative policies. Data indicate that race and interracial interaction are more complex than simple predictive relationships with social class or parental attitudes.

The book is certainly a good example of ethnography of schooling: the author admirably combines participant observation, interviews, and field experiments to present an intimate portrait of a desegregated school. The author found that interracial relations that developed over a period of three years was ""neither the optimistic prediction that would quickly and easily lead to very major gains in interracial harmony and friendship nor the pessimistic one that racial strife would be widespread and disruptive."" In conclusion, the book is an important contribution on desegregated schools and interracial relations. The many significant contributions of author's study, however, cannot be overemphasized.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"It has commonly been assumed that an advanced formal education bestows a more enlightened perspective that is less vulnerable to the narrow appeals of intergroup negativism. Other investigations have argued that education increases commitment to democratic norms, but only at a superficial level. These arguments are reviewed in the present paper and are then tested using national survey data (N = 1,914) on intergroup beliefs, feelings, predispositions for personal contact, and policy orientations of men toward women, of Whites toward Blacks, and of the nonpoor toward the poor. Analysis of the data failed to support the view either that education produces liberation from intergroup negativism or that it produces a superficial democratic commitment. It is argued that in paternalistic relationships that are relatively devoid of conflict, intergroup ideology has a simpler articulation, and the well educated are as unguarded as anyone else in affectionately delineating sharp distinctions between groups. However, when subordinate challenge forces more hostility into the relationship, the well educated are intellectually equipped to lead in the generation of a more sophisticated, refined ideology. In the race context, the well educated are slightly ahead of less educated Whites in developing interracial beliefs, feelings, and personal predispositions that pull back from making sharp categorical distinctions while maintaining critical racial boundaries.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"612 lone-assailant rape cases reported in 1 city between 1971 and 1975 were analyzed to determine whether a temporal variation in racial characteristics of rape within a single city would be evident. A factor controlling for the number of rapes committed by the same offender was entered into the analysis. An overview is presented of previous efforts to identify the racial characteristics of rapists and their victims, focusing on the intraracial assumption, the West phenomenon of Black-White interracial rape, changes in interracial rape, and numerical distortions in offender activity. Results of the present analysis indicate that rape was primarily intraracial during all years except 1971, in which it was predominantly interracial. Further variations were revealed when the racial interactions were classified according to the extent of an offender's assaultive activity. The serial offender, committing at least 2 assaults, complicated the relationship between race and rape, and the extensive assaults of a few individuals influenced the racial characteristics of the crime. Serial assaults by Black offenders suggested that interracial rape is not a unitary concept. Findings illustrate how failing to control for the activities of the series offenders distorts the actual number of offenders of any racial group and consequently over- and underestimates the representation of different racial groups.

During the spring and summer of 1983, 52 Black persisters (enrolled for the past 3-4 yrs) were personally interviewed, as were 41 Black student dropouts. Analysis showed that positive interracial contact experiences were related to Black student persistence in this predominantly White university. Persisters had more non-Black friends and high school classmates prior to college and expressed more positive feelings about Whites in general. However, they also expressed more negative feelings about their White professors and classmates than did their Black classmates who had dropped out. More dropouts than persisters participated in exclusively Black campus activities. Dropouts tended to experience more problems than persisters in financial concerns. Seven suggestions for changing the total educational environment to lower the rate of Black undergraduate attrition are given.

The Ss were 93 Black children and 307 White children in Grades 6, 8, 9, and 10. Results indicate that White Ss appeared to be more prejudiced than Blacks in situations requiring prolonged interracial contact; however, no differences were noted in circumstances involving minimal intimate social relationships for short periods of time. No differences in prejudice were found among grade levels; however, females were generally less prejudiced than males. Black males of low prejudice were more intelligent, more external, and less anxious than Black males of higher prejudice. It is suggested that integration in schools should be gradual and that personality factors, not external circumstances, may make major contributions to the development of prejudice.

These factors were the disposition of the White dyad members to either seek out or shun interaction with Blacks, the race (Black vs White) of the experimenter, and the gender composition (male-male vs female-female) of the dyads. Results show that within dyads, White dyad members displayed more interactional involvement than their Black partners but experienced the interactions as more stressful and uncomfortable. Whites predisposed to avoid interaction with Blacks looked and smiled at their partners less than those predisposed to initiate interaction. Both Black and White members of these avoidance dyads reported heightened feelings of anxiety and concern about their interactions, but the moderating influences of the Whites' approach-avoidance dispositions on interaction behavior were essentially limited to conditions in which the experimenter was Black and the White S was a ""solo minority."" It is suggested that Black-White partner effects are attributable to differing amounts of cross-race contact typically experienced by Blacks and Whites. Black-White experimenter effects are interpreted in terms of S. E. Taylor's (1981) hypothesis that stereotypes and related dispositions are activated in social contexts in which group membership is made salient.

Central to this theory are the concept of proportional size and the properties that emerge from the distribution of people's positions. Three important properties-heterogeneity, inequality, and intersection/consolidation-form the basis for the proposed hypotheses. These hypotheses hold that increasing heterogeneity increases the probability of intergroup relations; the intersection of nominal by graduated parameters integrates groups by raising the rates of social association among them; and the lower the positive correlations between parameters, the more extensive are the intergroup relations. Data from the 1970 US Census from metropolitan areas were used to test the hypotheses, with the result that rates of interracial marriage were inversely associated with various measures of racial inequality. Racial inequality was associated with racial salience, the predominance of ingroup relations, in the positive direction. The concept of salience was explicitly incorporated in the examination of a theoretical paradox in Blau's theory, namely, the failure to find a positive association between heterogeneity of race and intermarriage. It is concluded that the choice of mates is not completely free from the constraints of social structure.

Questionnaires and interviews with both children and parents revealed 3 ways that families dealt with racial identity issues. 18 of the families rarely discussed racial issues or associated with Blacks, and the children perceived themselves as different from other Blacks in terms of attitudes and culture. These children also held strong feelings of ""differentness"" and negative attitudes toward other Blacks. A 2nd group of 6 families acknowledged the child's racial identity and the need to provide Black role models for the child. These families lived in integrated neighborhoods, and the children expressed an interest in contact with other Blacks and often discussed racial identity issues with parents and peers. A 3rd group, in which parents generally had adopted several Black children, were characterized as interracial, and children were taught to emphasize their Black heritage. These families also provided a psychological support network for the adopted children. Findings suggest that transracial adoptions require special efforts on the part of parents and children and postplacement work on the part of the adoption agency.

Initial group encounters were intellectual and somewhat educational as Ss shared their life experiences. Armoring was used by Black and other Ss of color to promote self-caring during direct encounters with racist experiences. Co-leaders of the group were a Black clinician (the author) paired with a graduate student who had or was experiencing a mixed race relationship. Most Ss moved to the host environment of the spouse upon marriage. Group activity focused on establishing a definite identity for children and reinforcing it with models to support pridefulness. Group concerns about childrearing practices were racial: White Ss were criticized for being too permissive with children, and Black Ss were criticized by spouses for being too strict and by their families for being too permissive. Ss needed support and clarification around the question of what is developmental and what is cultural. Ss were trained to take leadership roles and continued meeting in their homes.

References to the race of therapist may be the first sign of a developing transference relationship. Failure to appreciate the impact of racial difference can impede therapeutic progress, while sensitive confrontation may be a valuable tool in the recognition and communication of emotionally charged feelings in therapy. Dream material is influenced by the race of the therapist who may be less easy to disguise in dreams, and the therapist may avoid certain dream interpretations because of unacknowledged discomfort about race. Three case studies illustrate how the author's racial difference influenced psychotherapeutic interactions. These observations have implications for the supervisory process in training and for the general issue of the influence of the person of the therapist on the process of psychotherapy.

Young siblings were intellectually similar, whether genetically related or not. In the AAS, Ss' IQ test scores were similar to those of their parents and siblings only if they were biologically related. It is concluded that younger children are more influenced by differences among their family environments than older adolescents, who are freer to seek their own niches.

Data from a survey of the registered social workers indicate inequities in the delivery of social services. Providers serving non-Whites tended to spend less time providing casework services and more time on providing welfare services than did providers serving Whites. These interracial differences may be explained by income or employment auspice. The major racial inequity became apparent when providers serving primarily non-White clients were analyzed. White providers serving non-Whites spent more time on welfare activities and less on casework services than did non-White providers serving non-Whites. These differences cannot be explained by income or the providers' education and experience. Such patterns of delivery raise issues for the profession and have implications for the needs, usage, and training of qualified personnel. It is concluded that research aimed at evaluating the consequences of these differences and programs to eliminate inequities should be of the highest priority.

From a sociological perspective, the concept of ""absorption of immigrants"" into Israeli society has elements of both a fusion or melting-pot model and an assimilationist-integrationist model. Israelis stress the solidarity that emerges from a common Judaic heritage, but as the author notes, the foundations of the social and political State of Israel rest firmly in modern European values and institutions. Israelis with European roots assumed that Oriental immigrants would renounce their ""Levantine"" background and conform to the values of a Western, industrialized society. While IM has contributed to the creation of a genetically mixed population, it has not necessarily fostered widespread integration. It is suggested that there must be a conscientious and serious effort to restore the historic legitimacy of the Oriental culture to its proper place in the current value system. There must be a reaffirmation of the Oriental experience in Jewish history, literature, and religious philosophy in a manner that will make even the youngest pupil proud of his/her heritage.

Results show that the largest differences favoring Whites were performance tests involving spatial-perceptual ability, whereas the tests favoring Blacks involved short-term memory. The profile of White-Black differences on the WISC-R subtests was markedly different and negatively correlated with the profiles of social class differences within each racial group, indicating that the pattern of racial differences is not explainable in terms of the difference in the average socioeconomic status of Blacks and Whites. Analysis of factor scores shows that the largest proportion of the variance between races is attributable to the general factor common to all the subtests, whereas the group factors (Verbal, Performance, and Memory) contributed only minutely to the interracial variance.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Expectation states theory (EST; J. Berger et al, 1966) has been used as the basis for applied research on race and its effects on interracial interaction (IRI). EST can be used to describe the process by which high-status members of IRI groups come to dominate group interaction. Using this theory, there are a number of interventions designed to modify status effects in settings where they are judged undesirable. In the classroom, expectation states affect observable behaviors of practical importance: (1) a pattern of White dominance in IRI on valued intellectual tasks: This pattern is undesirable because racist expectations for less competence from minority students are reinforced. (2) Expectation states also affect the participation, task engagement, and effort of the minority student on school tasks. If a student has generally low expectations for academic competence, he/she will be less likely to put out the requisite effort to become a more successful student. The author reviews the literature based on EST that deals with race as a status characteristic in educational settings, focusing on interventions that can shift IRI toward ""equal status behavior"" and away from dominance of the group by high-status members. Two of the interventions include the use of inconsistency to produce equality and the use of referent actors.

Results extend the findings of other researchers who found that color may be less important than the expectations and meanings attributed to social interactions, which vary widely within individuals. There had also been a significant and reliable variance in the way biracial stimuli have been perceived, from which a range of interracial attitudes within any population can be inferred. In behavioral tests, White children showing negative feelings toward Blacks also demonstrated less positive attitudes toward White peers in cooperative tasks.

The race and sex of the person with whom S was interacting were coded, as were the behavior's mutuality (one-sided, mutual), affective tone (positive, neutral, negative), and orientation (task oriented, ambiguous, social). Considerably more cross-race interaction was noted than found in previous studies conducted in nonacademic settings in interracial schools. Ss interacted significantly more with peers of their own race than with peers of the other race. This was due to the females' strong own-race preference. Males interacted cross-racially at approximately the rate that would be expected if race were not a factor in interactant choice. Male interactions were predominantly mutual in nature, whereas those of females were predominantly one-sided. There were no major differences in the tone of the inter- or intraracial interactions of Ss in the 4 sex-race subgroups. Negative behaviors constituted less than 1% of all interactions. Cross-race interactions of all groups were more task related than within-race interactions, within-race interactions were more social than cross-race interactions.

The ultimate intent of the project was to find a path for more extensive research aimed at improving interracial attitudes and behavior, especially in work situations. Behavior modeling training was used as the vehicle for attempting to change the behaviors. Ss were 131 employees (mean age 39 yrs) and 12 supervisors (mean age 41 yrs). Several measures were used because it was uncertain how change would be found. A questionnaire and expectation scale did not reveal significant change, possibly because of the small sample size and the reluctance of supervisors to be candid. Structured interviews, however, indicated dramatic improvements in interrace attitudes and observations for both supervisors and employees. Second posttest improvements (20 wks after training) were, in fact, even greater than improvements noted at the 1st posttest (six wks after training). Before and after training, comments by employees and supervisors provided strong evidence of the extent of change that occurred.

Females who married across ethnic groups generally scored higher in 1 domain of personality (dominance) than did females who married within their own ethnic group. Males who married cross-ethnically also differed in dominance from those who did not, but in different directions in different ethnic groups. In the group that had the highest status (Whites) in the decades in which these Ss married, they were less dominant; in the other groups, to varying degrees, they were more dominant. In general, males and females in cross-ethnic matings were more similar in personality test scores than males and females who married within their own ethnic groups. Spouse correlations were generally positive, with little difference in personality between homogamous and heterogamous couples. The average difference in personality between those who married within and outside their own ethnic group was associated with the rarity of outmarriage for the sex and ethnic group concerned.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Investigated the effects of deindividuation, anger, and race-of-victim on aggression displayed by 96 White male undergraduates. Deindividuating situational cues produced an internal state of deindividuation that mediated aggressive behavior. Deindividuation theories are extended by the finding that the internal state of deindividuation was composed not only of the factors Self-Awareness and Altered Experience, but also Group Cohesiveness, Responsibility, and Time Distortion. As predicted, nonangered Whites were less aggressive toward Black than White victims, but angered Whites were more aggressive toward Blacks than Whites. Interracial behavior was consistent with new, egalitarian norms if anger was not aroused, but regressed to the old, historical pattern of racial discrimination if anger was aroused. This pattern of interracial behavior was interpreted in terms of a new form of racism: regressive racism.

It is a compilation of review chapters written by some of the leading researchers who have drawn together current findings and ideas in the major research areas of children's friendships and social relations. The volume is designed for all those with academic and applied interests in children's social development. Amongst psychologists it will be of particular interest to those working in the flelds of social, developmental, and educational psychology. It will also appeal to sociologists and ethologists whose interests lie in the aetiology, culture, and organization of children's social groups. For those who are professionally concerned with children in teaching, in child care, or in social work there is also much of value in the book. Several chapters deal specifically with children's relationships in the classroom, their conceptions of their peers and the development of friendship cliques.

Although businesslike environments impeded overall cross-racial association, they had no effect on more purposeful intergroup contacts, which were facilitated by teacher patience and by diversity in instructional arrangements.

Reviews the book, Mixed Families: Adopting Across Racial Boundaries by Joyce A. Ladner (1977). This study on transracial adoption brings a new point of view to a controversial issue. It is an attempt to describe a broad cross section of white families who adopted Black and interracial children. The trend started in the early '60s and reached its highest point 10 years later. It slowed down almost to a standstill when the Association of Black Social Workers came out strongly against placement of any Black children in White homes where they would not be able to develop a sense of racial identity. Ladner takes a different position. She believes that the controversy between the advocates of transracial adoption and their opponents overshadows the real issue. She feels that White parents with special qualities of sensitivity, self-awareness, and maturity can be permitted to adopt Black children.

Neither the authors nor the reviewers seem to have taken into account the impact of the dramatic rise in foreign adoptions. Moreover, the reviewers are correct in pointing out that single parent adoption (also on the increase) is rarely regarded as an alternative to transracial adoption. On the contrary, single adoptive parents are major consumers of cross-racial adoption. The continued longitudinal analysis of children in transracial families is to be encouraged, not out of mere academic curiosity, but as an issue of vital practical concern.

This book represents an excellent review of the general history of adoption issues and policy as well as of transracial adoption. Because of the sensitivity and honesty with which the authors confront current sociopolitical pressures, the book should stimulate discussion rather than acrimonious dispute. It is hoped that Simon and Altstein will follow these children through adolescence and adulthood to determine whether their development continues as their parents and the authors now expect. Such a longitudinal analysis could provide significant insights into the currently active dispute over genetic versus environmental determinants of intelligence. The reviewers recommend the book to everyone interested in adoption generally and transracial adoption in particular, both professionals and concerned laypersons.

The level of competence of group members was also varied. The Ss, who were White military servicemen from small towns and rural areas of the southern US, expressed significantly greater attraction for more competent than for less competent groupmates, and for White groupmates than Black. Comparison of these data with the findings of an earlier study suggests that receipt by a group of a meaningful reward for success is a significant factor in promoting feelings of satisfaction and the development of intermember attraction in such groups. In the absence of such a reward, Ss in this study did not differ in the attraction they expressed for groupmates as a function of group outcome (success, failure, and neutral outcomes) or of personally helping less competent groupmates. Implications of these findings for management of the integration process are discussed. No evidence was found of self-enhancing or self-defensive biases in the attribution of responsibility for group outcomes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The existence of equal-status interracial interaction often has been taken for granted, despite the existence of negative and contradictory research results. A major problem lies in the fact that the equal-status concept has remained vague and inconsistently defined. In the present paper, a reformulation of the equal-status concept is proposed, and a critical review of previous research is developed. Studies in which equal status is confirmed, questionable, and nonexistent are differentiated. Many studies that obtained favorable results were found to have a questionable basis for their claim of equal status. It is suggested that these studies can be explained with reference to far less problematic variables that are also identified with the theory of contact (e.g., intimacy, common goals, institutional support, and racial/ethnic balance). Studies in which equal status is confirmed invariably result in positive change. Some research was uncovered in which the existence of equal status, although questionable, was maintained even in the face of negative results. A more critical and systematic approach is advised, and a reformulation of the equal status concept is offered.

The likes and dislikes of 482 female and 549 male Caucasian college students for eye color, hair color, and complexion color of the opposite sex were investigated by means of sexual selection questionnaire. Results indicate sex differences in both likes and dislikes for all 3 features. Males indicated somewhat greater preference for lighter female coloration, while females indicated somewhat greater preference for darker male coloration. These results are discussed in terms of the ""kernel of truth"" hypothesis of stereotyping, and the possible relationship to earlier research on semantic meanings of color and gender words. Special attention was paid to the aversion of both sexes to redheads, and to the implications for understanding the predominance of Black male/White female couplings in Black-White interracial marriage in America.

The Multifactor Racial Attitude Inventory was used to measure prejudice. In Exp I, 36 high- and low-prejudiced White female undergraduates, acting as teachers, were led to praise successful White and Black students (confederates). Analysis of samples of nonverbal behavior showed that high-prejudiced teachers nonverbally discriminated between White and Black students (favoring Whites) significantly more than low-prejudiced teachers. In Exp II, 40 White and Black teachers (female undergraduates) taught successful White and Black students (confederates). Results show that both Whites and Blacks behaved nonverbally more positively to a student of their own race than to a student of the other race, although only same-race judges (12 White female undergraduates) could distinguish the differences in affect displayed by the Ss.

Ss were given a battery of attitudes indices and behavior measures, including the Koslin Social Distance Scale, the K-Z Test, the Friendship Questionnaire, and social distance, picture imitation, and discrimination tasks. Ss who were high in prejudice were randomly assigned to an experimental condition or a matched control group. Race of examiner was varied. Posttests were administered after 2 wks and again 4-6 mo later. Results reveal a significant short-term reduction in prejudice for all experimental groups on combined measures. Vicarious contact and perceptual approaches were more effective than the other 2 methods. Some interaction effects with grade and race of examiner were found. Long-term treatment effects were less pronounced, although some gains were maintained in the vicarious contact and perceptual differentiation groups.

The relationships among several types of interracial contact and tolerance were examined for teenagers from schools with varying degrees of racial balance. 5,800 Georgia high school students, Black and White, of both sexes, responded to a paper-and-pencil survey measuring interaction with classmates of the other race. The schools were selected on the basis of racial sex from urban and rural districts. Factor analysis determined that all 8 survey questions measured the same dimension. Mere classroom attendance at a desegregated school was not associated with greater White tolerance for Blacks, but contact implying equal status did increase such tolerance. There were some sex differences in degree of contact associated with tolerance in both races.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Studied interracial attitudes and behavior during a series of week-long sessions at a summer camp. The camp involved prolonged, intimate contact between 92 Black and 104 White children of equal status. The situation was structured so that each living unit had a Black and a White counselor and equal numbers of Black and White campers. Measures of racial attitudes and behavior included a verbal attitude assessment, a series of interpersonal choices, and an analysis of photographs taken by the Ss. All 3 measures showed some significant and positive changes. Consistent with other studies, males generally showed more positive interracial attitudes and behavior than females. As a consequence of the elevated pretest scores of males, only females showed significant changes in attitudes and interpersonal choices. Possible rival hypotheses for the obtained changes are analyzed and rejected, and it is suggested that intergroup attitudes and behavior depend on the relative power and status of the groups in the social situation within which they interact.

This book represents one of the better attempts at delving into the Black ""psyche."" The book is very successful and stands as one of the most thoughtfully planned and researched volumes on interracial differences yet written. The book's stated purposes are to learn about the ways of thinking found in the Black ghetto and to develop a map of this way of thinking that could be compared with the corresponding map of middle-class Whites. The idea is that if we teach Whites to understand the way of thinking of Blacks, they will get along better. In spite of the wealth of information that the book provides, it fails at an interpretive level to provide the map of ghetto thinking it seeks to provide. A far more disappointing aspect of the book is its usage of the concept of ""ecosystem distrust"" as an explanatory paradigm for summarizing the data on the subjective perceptions of the Black sample. The book is well worth reading because it provides a wealth of information about what Black people think. Whether it provides an accurate rationale for the reason why Black people think the way we do is debatable.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Erratum/Correction,"In ""Motivation, Race, Social Class, and IQ"" by W. Samuel, D. Soto, M. Parks, P. Ngissah, and B. Jones (Journal of Educational Psychology, 1976, 68, 273-285), there are two inaccuracies pertaining to Table 4. First, the standard deviation reported for low-socioeconomic status Whites with a Black tester in the low expectation-evaluative condition was misprinted as 2.89 instead of its true value of 19.24. Second, the F ratio for the Atmosphere x Socioeconomic Status x Race of Subject x Race of Experimenter interaction should be 2.84 (p < .10) rather than 8.76, as reported on p. 282 (first column, fifth line from the bottom). This interaction was peripheral to the main hypotheses of the article and does not affect its conclusions. All other F ratios are accurate. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 1976-23080-001.) Administered the Performance subscales of the WISC to 208 male and 208 female junior and senior high school students (aged 12-16 yrs) to test the prediction that if performance responded to the manipulation of the testee's motivation state, the size of interracial differences in mean IQ would be more flexible than was suggested by A. R. Jensen's (1969) review of the literature. The variables of test atmosphere (evaluative or gamelike), tester expectation (high or low), race of tester (Black or White), and race of S (Black or White) were manipulated. The pattern of mean IQ scores as well as self-ratings of mood indicated that test performance was optimal at moderate levels of motivational arousal. A replication of the experiment employing 208 male Ss increased cell sizes to the point that socioeconomic status could be treated as an independent variable. Results suggested that interracial differences in mean IQ might be erased depending upon the social psychological characteristics of the test setting and the socioeconomic background of the testee.

The personality characteristics predictive of prejudice and prejudice changes, and how these characteristics differ between Blacks and Whites were also examined. 63 Black and 49 White male inmates newly admitted to a medium security state correctional institution served as Ss. Over a 1-mo period every new inmate was requested to answer a series of questionnaires to assess his cognitive complexity, self-esteem, attitudes toward people, and prejudice. Three weeks after his 1st session each S was requested to respond to a 2nd measure of prejudice. Results indicate that initially Whites were much more prejudiced than Blacks. The contact situation increased prejudice in Blacks and decreased prejudice in Whites. Within each group positive attitudes toward people in general predicted a decrease in prejudice. This was the only variable that functioned alike for both races. Simple cognitive structure, highly predictive of prejudice in Whites, was predictive of a very low level of prejudice in Blacks. Low self-esteem predicted a decrease in prejudice in Whites but an increase in prejudice in Blacks. It is concluded that implementation of contact situations should not be undertaken without adequate insight into the effects on both races.

The present study employed a card-game paradigm to investigate the efficacy of these factors in enhancing interracial acceptance. 32 Black and 32 White male volunteers (average age 23.5 yrs) in a drug abuse program were randomized in a 3 (type of game) x 2 (level of competition) x 2 (race) design. Results suggest the importance of both cooperation and competition in increasing interracial acceptance. Anticipation of a highly competitive situation proved to be more important than the actual team-interaction process. Results suggest that the generalizability of the treatment effects may vary across the races as a function of the racial balance in the daily social milieu. Further research must assess the reliability and significance of this generalization.

Prior to responding, one-third of the Ss observed a White peer model administer low level shocks, another third observed the same model administer high level rewards, while a final third did not observe the specific responses of the model. To examine the effects of modeling in comparison to an inhibitory strategy, half the Ss were informed that the target would have an opportunity to retaliate. While retaliation reduced aggression and increased reward, it also led to an increase in an indirect form of aggression (i.e., shock duration). Observation of either model, however, reduced aggression without increases in indirect aggression. In addition, observation of one type of model's response generalized to another response (e.g., observation of low aggression increased reward, while observation of high reward reduced aggression). Results are discussed in terms of strategies to reduce interracial aggression and the effectivenes of nonaggressive models as a means of aggression control.

Research supporting this idea is discussed and findings are reinterpreted from symbolic interactionist and situationalist points of view. The position is developed that much of interaction dynamics between Blacks and liberal Whites is situationally determined. Such interaction is characterized by strong situationally specific cues, both internal (e.g., anger, fear, guilt), and external (e.g., color of other). In conjunction with behavioral demand factors, emanating from cultural myths which set up expectations for specific behavior patterns from self and other in such encounters, these cues operate to elicit stereotypical behavior from Blacks and Whites as ""interracial interactants."" From the perspective developed, a reconceptualization of interracial interaction is presented, and its implications are discussed.

Reviews the book, Psychology and Race edited by Peter Watson (1974). This book was written to present an objective account of race and racism from various social science perspectives. It is divided into two parts: Part One, Aspects of Interracial Interaction, has three sections. The first, Focus on the Majority Group (Section A), consists of papers on the development of racial awareness and prejudice in children, the measurement of prejudice, cognitive and affective dimensions of prejudice, and techniques for reducing prejudice. Section B, Focus on the Minority Group, consists of papers on Negro self-identity, race and marginality (mixed bloods and Jews), and the problems of adjustment and assimilation of immigrants. The four papers in Section C focus on Interaction, treat various dimensions of behavior, attitude, and performance in interracial situations. Part two is titled The Race Variable and Key Issues in Social Psychology. This title is misleading. In reality the 10 papers, under the four subheadings of The Interaction of Personality and Culture, Education, Language, and Miscellany of Other Key Issues (including psychiatric disorders of minority groups, crime and delinquency in immigrant and minority groups, and tests as sources of discrimination in personnel decisions) only in part deal with issues in social psychology as generally conceived.

The deviate positions on each of the issues for discussion were (a) opposition to the legalization of abortion, (b) opposition to interracial marriage, (c) opposition to living together before marriage, and (d) advocacy of violence as a legitimate means of political protest. 12 deviates were selected. They were asked to formulate arguments concerning a topic, and each was provided with arguments to supplement his or her own ideas. 12 groups, each containing a deviate and 3 other participants, initially discussed 1 of the 4 topics for 30 min. Each naive member of these groups was later assigned to a new group in which the same topic was discussed. Arguments presented by the deviates were identified from tapes of the sessions, and their use by members of the original group in the successive groups was traced. Analysis of the data showed that the arguments presented by the deviates were repeated in the successive groups with a frequency significantly greater than chance. Arguments presented by the ""violence"" deviate were repeated with significantly greater frequency than those of the other deviates. It is concluded that arguments presented by a deviate do influence the choice of arguments by majority members in subsequent discussions on the same topic.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Delineates the myths of Black sexuality and the issues involved in the use of an interracial therapy team which must be considered in applying directive programs to the treatment of sexually dysfunctioning Afro-American couples. Myths concerning the hypersexuality of Blacks depict Black males as sensual, aggressive, and easily aroused lovers who have unusually long latencies to ejaculation, and depict Black females as requiring intercourse for sexual gratification and being able to dispense with foreplay. Interracial therapy teams raise issues connected with differences and similarities in the life styles of therapist and client, antagonism of the client toward the therapist, and excessive consciousness of race on the part of the therapist. Furthermore, the special factors involved in a behavioral approach to sexual dysfunctioning raise issues connected with (a) the therapist being placed in the role of sexual expert, (b) dilution of the therapeutic presence by the therapist's attempt to compensate for stereotypic reactions to Black sexuality, and (c) behaviors that are accepted as normal within the client's culture being treated as sexually deviant by the therapist. A case history elucidating management of the myths and issues is presented, and implications for treatment and research are discussed.

A 2-3 factorially designed experiment was conducted with 64 White US Air Force airmen. The success or failure of the group and race of the recipient served as additional independent variables. Ss, who were from southern small towns and rural areas, felt significantly greater satisfaction with the group experience and greater attraction for a less competent group member when they were induced to help him than when help was provided by another member of the group. Ss also felt greater satisfaction with the group experience and developed greater attraction for their groupmates when their group was successful than did Ss who participated in failing groups. Each of the effects held for both White and Black recipients of help. Implications of these findings for the management of the integration process are discussed.

Peer-Reviewed Status-Unknown",Journal Article,"Tested the hypothesis that the culture shock Black students experience in attending a predominantly White college leads to a greater weakening of authoritarianism in these students as compared with their White peers. The question of how far interracial contact is related to the liberalizing or narrowing of attitudes was also examined. The study discusses how the culture shock process might work in a predominantly White college, how it might bring about a weakening in authoritarian attitudes over time for Black students, and what processes would encourage or mitigate the effects. Longitudinal data on 407 Black and White college freshmen are analyzed. Weakening in authoritarianism was measured by the Autonomy scale of the Omnibus Personality Inventory. In support of the culture shock hypothesis, Black students who were protected from the unfamiliarity of a predominantly White college by close, dependent relationships with faculty were less subject to liberalizing attitudinal change than Black students not so protected. Having a greater number of student friends (i.e., greater exposure to the unfamiliar environment) was, however, associated with greater change towards nonauthoritarian attitudes. These relationships varied for White students in a way generally suggested by the hypothesis.

Color preference and color attitudes were measured in 3 different ways. A correlation was found between playground behavior (i.e., positive or negative play with peers) and response to the colors black and white as measured in a situation in which Ss guessed the locus of origin of positive and negative self-evaluative statements broadcast simultaneously from black and white boxes. The correlation was substantially higher for females than for males. The high correlation for females is discussed in terms of a difference between the sexes in rate of perceptual and linguistic development.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"A review of the literature and the miscellany of statistics and studies raises a question as to the substantive validity of the untested thesis that, on the whole, caste and class positions have been traded off in White marriages with Blacks and that such marriages are peculiarly lower class. Based on an examination of all occupational information given for couples and their parents on the Philadelphia marriage license records in recent years (1960-1962 and 1965-1970), it was found that all socioeconomic groups significantly participated in interracial marriages, with professional and white-collar groups remarkably well represented. Generally, there was no distinguishable degree of ""marrying up"" or ""marrying down"" by Whites and Blacks with one another. A case by case study of the relative occupational position of husband and wife indicated a prevalent position of equality; but when there was a difference between Blacks and Whites, Whites more often married Blacks of lower status. Other races in mixed marriages present a different picture which merits separate and further analysis.

The different environments within the institutions were defined in terms of the norms as perceived by the residents of the different living areas. Ss were pretested for cognitive complexity, self-esteem, and attitudes toward people in general. Interracial attitudes of these Ss were measured at 2 time periods: as the Ss entered the institution and 3 wks later.

Less direct aggression was delivered to a Black target when Ss witnessed a White person delivering low level shocks to a Black than when Ss witnessed unspecified White behavior.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Analyzed 6 dimensions of racial ideology, using interview data from 1,934 Blacks in a Northern and a Southern city. Blacks who favored separatism tended to be more alienated, fearful of race genocide, race conscious, and supportive of racial violence than those who endorsed interracial cooperation. Suspicion, distrust, and estrangement toward White society were particularly evident in the sentiments of Blacks less than 30 yrs old who lived in the Northern city and who had low socioeconomic status.

A racial attitude inventory made up of 9 empirically identified dimensions successfully predicted Whites' membership in attitudinal criterion groups. Two additional dimensions were hypothesized: (a) reactions to interracial marriage and (b) preference between 2 approaches to racial equality for Black Americans, one stressing changes in society and one stressing changes in Blacks themselves. Cluster analyses confirmed the existence of these 2 additional dimensions as well as the original 9. A validation study indicates that both new dimensions as well as the original 9 successfully differentiate groups of Whites known to differ in racial attitude.

Current interest focuses on the research process itself in the study of race relations, particularly the role of the researchers' attitudes and values. The present Journal issue is organized into 3 sections. The 1st 5 articles deal with how White Americans perceive, evaluate, and respond to Black Americans. The 2nd series (3 articles) deals with the reverse: how Black Americans relate to White Americans. Two articles in the 3rd section directly compare and contrast the attitudes of Blacks and Whites. It is felt that as a group the papers offer some new methods and concepts that seem promising for the reduction of interracial conflict, but that conflict will nevertheless continue in the immediate future.

R. Jensen's (1969) review of the literature. The variables of test atmosphere (evaluative or gamelike), tester expectation (high or low), race of tester (Black or White), and race of S (Black or White) were manipulated. The pattern of mean IQ scores as well as self-ratings of mood indicated that test performance was optimal at moderate levels of motivational arousal. A replication of the experiment employing 208 male Ss increased cell sizes to the point that socioeconomic status could be treated as an independent variable. Results suggested that interracial differences in mean IQ might be erased depending upon the social psychological characteristics of the test setting and the socioeconomic background of the testee.

White males were aggressive and persistent but nonaltruistic and unable to resist temptations to break the rules of society or repair the damage they caused to others. Black males were nonaggressive, persistent altruistic, and more likely than any other group to make reparation for injury. White females were nonaggressive, likely to make reparation for damage to others, and altruistic; they displayed resistance to temptation but little delay of gratification-task persistence. Black females exhibited the same self-control pattern as White women and also were nonaggressive, nonaltruistic, and not inclined toward reparation for damage to others; their most outstanding behavior, however, was a high level of explaining feelings to increase understanding, resolve strife, and reassure others.

As part of an initiation ceremony, 57 Black and 55 White 8-12 yr olds observed the behavior of unfamiliar Black adult and White adult models responding to the commands of an Indian chief. In 3 separate camp sessions, the proportions of responses imitative of racially different models were 0.40, 0.42, and 0.37 for campers observed on the 1st day and 0.52, 0.49, and 0.53 for those observed on the 5th day. The overall difference between low and high contact groups was significant (p < .05). A separate-sample pretest-posttest design ruled out threats to the internal validity of the study, and the observation of behavior in a naturalistic context enhanced the ecological validity. It is concluded that interracial contact effects were not limited to changes in behavior among the children themselves but generalized to unfamiliar adults encountered in the same setting.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the effects of competence of group member and group success-failure on interpersonal attraction of White Ss for both White and Black group mates in cooperating interracial groups. Ss were 60 military service men from southern small towns and rural areas. Ss exhibited less attraction for a Black group mate when he performed less competently than when he performed competently. No parallel effect for competence was found on attraction to White group mates. Ss liked and respected both their White and their Black group mates more following group success than following group failure. There was a Competence * Success-Failure interaction on attraction for Black group mates; the combination of low competence and group failure produced the least liking and respect. The lowered attraction expressed toward a less competent Black group mate is explained in terms of fulfilling the Ss' stereotypes. The lack of a competence effect when White Ss rated White group mates is discussed in relation to other cues that become important when interaction extends beyond first-impression situations. The Competence * Group Success-Failure interaction on attraction to Black group mates is interpreted with regard to the scapegoat hypothesis.

These interracial situations thrust Jewish liberals more often than their non-Jewish counterparts into brief dilemmas and role conflicts which they resolved by mechanisms redefining liberal roles. It is argued that although the 204-person sample was representative of only the upper range of statuses among Jews and non-Jews, it permitted rigorous test of an ethnic identification hypothesis among those most committed to racial liberalism.

Analysis of variance results show that White Ss slightly preferred Whites for the satisfaction of their academic and social needs. However, with stepwise multiple regression analysis, race was not a significant predictor variable for academic or social acceptance by White Ss. GPA and sex were the most prominent predictors of acceptance. Black Ss accepted both Black peers and White peers equally for academic interaction but preferred Blacks for social interaction. Race was a significant predictor variable for academic and social acceptance by Black Ss. However, race was secondary to GPA and/or sex for academic acceptance by Black females and Black males.

No main effects for the race of the group member being evaluated or the level of participation in decision making were obtained, nor were there interactions among any of the 3 independent variables. Separate analyses of the attraction ratings given the White and the Black groupmates further revealed that whatever elevated or depressed the ratings for one, similarly affected the ratings for the other.

Exp I, which employed 14 white job interviewers (male university students) and 5 trained white and black job applicants, demonstrated that black applicants received (a) less immediacy, (b) higher rates of speech errors, and (c) shorter amounts of interview time. Exp II employed 30 naive, white applicants (male university students) and 2 trained white interviewers. In this experiment Ss received behaviors that approximated those given either the black or white applicants in Exp I. Results indicate that Ss treated like the blacks of Exp I were judged to perform less adequately and to be more nervous in the interview situation than Ss treated like the whites. The former Ss also reciprocated with less proximate positions and rated the interviewers as being less adequate and friendly. Implications for black unemployment are discussed.

Both blacks and whites at all 3 grade levels chose significantly more members of their own race than members of the other race; blacks rejected whites significantly less than would be expected by chance, an effect which increased over time for older pupils; and, initially, whites rejected blacks less frequently than expected by chance, but shifted to approximately chance rejection of blacks. In January and February 1971, 2 observers counted interactions among pupils in each grade for 10 min for 5 wks. As expected, interactions increased significantly with grade level; however, subsequent analysis revealed that the primary variable determining interracial interactions is the proportion of blacks to whites in the classroom. A relatively low proportion of minority members (black or white) appears to be most effective in improving interracial relations.

The influence of the studies of F. Galton and of G. Mendel on late 19th and early 20th century thinking is discussed, emphasizing the stress on ""disharmonious combinations"" caused by intermingling the genetic traits of different races. Serious questioning of this thesis is traced from the mid-1920s. A change in published statements on race crossing from condemnation to agnosticism to a certitude that race crossing is not biologically dangerous and may even lead to increased vigor is noted from the mid-1930s to 1951 when the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization published its favorable review. It is pointed out that a similar controversy related to race crossing is now taking place concerning hereditary mental differences between races, pivoting around A. Jensen's 1969 study. It is concluded that changing social attitudes will probably influence this area of biology, regardless of the existence of little new scientific evidence, because history has shown that genetic views are closely meshed with social and political considerations.

A program of consultation to an inner-city junior high school faculty based on these 2 models is described and evaluated. In applying process consultation and open systems theory, the school consultant strives for active participation by all in the problem-solving process, leading to self-assessment and self-directed change. Process consultation involves the organization and the consultant in the ""joint assessment"" of the problems, with particular focus on the ""processes"" within the system that need improvement. The consultation program occurred in 1969 when the principal of a racially mixed junior high school requested a program for graduate students to do counseling for the emotionally disturbed children in his school. The tentative plan was for graduate students to enter the system as consultants to teachers around issues and concerns at the level of the classroom. There were 8 projects in the program: (a) development of teacher skills in small-group techniques, (b) behavior modification, (c) videotape recording and playback of teaching styles, (d) motivational development in a special reading class, (e) systems analysis and sociometric patterning in the classroom, (f) use of psychodrama technique for classroom communication, (g) teacher and counselor discussion group for interracial issues, and (h) environmental engineering and control in the classroom.

Prior to statistical analysis, 2 orthogonal variates were identified: direct aggression and indirect aggression. It was found that lower levels of direct aggression were delivered to black targets under potential censure conditions (responses available) than under noncensure conditions (responses not available). No differential responding was exhibited toward white targets as a function of the same situational conditions. In Exp. II, potential censure was found to facilitate both a direct form of reward and an indirect form of aggression toward black targets. Results are discussed in terms of problems associated with heightening aggressive inhibitions. An expanded conceptualization of the notion of indirect aggression is offered.

The latter says that all white Americans, symbolized by Lulu, tease the black into demanding his rights and then murder him, using his demands as justification. But on the psychoanalytical level the underlying themes are oral loss, frustration, and consequent rage. When Clay breaks from his false white man's self, his black identity erupts in such intense rage that he dies in the next instant. The play's fundamental tension between true and false identity is an orally based schizoid one in which the personality is charged with hatred and disintegrates in a self-destructive defense. The 2 ways of expressing aggression, transformation and violent revenge, represented in the play, correspond to E. Erickson's 2 categories of oral defense, the expulsive and the intrusive. The symbolic role of the subway passengers is briefly analyzed.

In the main study, 32 black and 32 white Ss completed the Self-Analysis Questionnaire and 2 racial attitude scales. Ss then viewed slides of racial situations and their blood pressure and respiration were recorded. Results do not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or noncognitive level, that state anxiety is altered by vicarious ""formal"" or ""informal"" interracial situations, and that black girls react more intensely to such situations whan white ones. However, differential reactions did result from vicariously experiencing ""formal"" vs. ""informal"" situations. (25 ref.)

This incident aggravated previous latent fears within group members. Afraid to discuss their feelings and faced with this common threat, they banded together and displaced the feelings onto a less threatening but significant issue-the racial feelings within the group. This discussion revealed, metaphorically, some of their reactions to the provoking incident, thus serving as resistance. The phenomenon of group resistance is explored, and it is concluded that such an intense resistance is particularly difficult for the therapist to handle. (17 ref.)

Davis (see record 1966-02762-001) study. 150 white undergraduates responded on behavioral differential scales to stimulus persons who varied in race and 2 beliefs. Ss also evaluated civil rights issues, along with the stimulus-person beliefs. Using multidimensional scaling and multimode factor analysis, 2 S factors were isolated. These 2 S types, called race rejectors and belief rejectors, differed systematically with respect to the importance attached to the race or belief characteristics of the stimulus persons. Furthermore, race was increasingly important for all S types as the response continuum became more intimate. A cube of data consisting of stimulus person characteristics, response continuum, and S type is presented in interpreting the race vs. belief controversy. Finally, the hypothesis that race rejectors would perceive their important others as more disapproving of interracial contacts than would belief rejectors is confirmed.

Of the 3 measures of status, income, occupation, and education, the research on education is most clear-cut.

The demanding intellectual work to get beyond cliches and slogans to a fundamental and usable understanding of the important social problems is stressed. Several experimental studies of interpersonal conflict, i.e., United States foreign policy, are considered. The nature of these ideas and the results of the experiments bearing on them are discussed. A rationale is offered for the view that the games people play as Ss in laboratory experiments are relevant to war and peace. (27 ref.)

During the summer of 1946, the Research Center for Group Dynamics (then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and the Connecticut Interracial Commission jointly sponsored a workshop for community leaders. Each evening the research and training staffs gathered to pool their observations of the day's events. At some point, a group of participants joined these meetings and, a short time later, claimed that they were learning more about their own behavior and their group's development from these evening meetings than they were from their daytime sessions. These events are commonly believed to be the origin of the experience-based method of teaching people about interpersonal relations and the processes involved in group development. The method employs groups whose only agenda is its own self-analysis. This book is an exhaustive study of leader-member interaction in four such groups, whose members were enrolled in a course at Harvard University entitled, ""Social Relations 120 Analysis of Interpersonal Behavior.""

The Commission's fact-finding has involved four general subject areas: (1) The extent of racial isolation in the public schools and the extent of the disparity in educational achievement between white and Negro school children; (2) the factors that contribute to intensifying and perpetuating school segregation; (3) the relationship between racially isolated education and the outcomes of that education, and the impact of racial isolation on the attitudes and interracial associations of Negroes and whites; and (4) the various programs that have been proposed or put into operation for remedying educational disadvantage and relieving racial isolation in the schools. The Commission has sought out the facts in the hope of shedding needed light on the issues. On the basis of its findings, the Commission has made recommendations which may provide a basis for action by government at all levels; action that it hopes will fulfill for all American children--Negro and white alike--the promise of equality of educational opportunity.

The study were based on a sample survey of almost 2,500 households in the Honolulu Standard Metropolitan Area. Out of 2,486 households in the sample, 1,874 consisted of members of the same race, 406 were mixed, and 206 lacked adult partners of different sexes. Differences between the mixed and unmixed racial distributions were found to be significant at the one per cent level. The higher income level of unmixed households was attributable only in part to higher occupational status. The greater youthfulness of interracial households was likewise not an important factor in the income difference. Whatever the reasons, mixed households appear to be handicapped in many ways. Their occupational status, income level, and housing are far inferior to the norms enjoyed by unmixed households.

The Report covers a wide range of insightful observations concerning the psychodynamics of responses to desegregation. The treatment of the functions of racial myths and prejudices in supporting arguments for segregation is one of the most succinct and effective that this reviewer has seen, especially as it considers fears related to sex and the psychological, sociological, and biological aspects of interracial marriage. The shortcomings of this little volume are few and relatively minor. Many of the principles and observations are based upon actual desegregation studies, and, in view of the comprehensiveness and success of the St. Louis desegregation plan, one is surprised to note the absence from the text and from the highly useful bibliography.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article discusses the trends in orthopsychiatric therapy by specifically focusing on the evolution and trends in group psychotherapy. All kinds of groups are initiated, depending on what phase of individual insecurity is considered the neediest. There is an increase in economic groups, such as labor unions, to provide economic security. Religious groups are formed on the basis that the spiritual life of the individual is void and needs new values for combatting the conscience-less deeds committed both the group and the individual alike. There are interracial groups and international groups-all with the earnest desire to promote better understanding between participants. These groups were all of a repressive-inspirational nature and all have been successful in different degrees in attaining a happier life for their participants. Despite the multiplicity and the variety of groups, there still remained a large number of individuals who, though desiring to be accepted members, could not join a group, or when they did, could not remain in it because of inability to give adequate expression to their needs and feelings. Group therapy in counseling form and nondirective in attitude, has been explored by Rogers and has been the subject of research. In activity groups with delinquent children, especially the very aggressive, any attempt by the worker to interfere with destructive behavior results in more participants being drawn into the fight.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"A full-scale test of Rokeach's theory of belief prejudice with 630 9th-grade students strongly supports the validity of the theory. When information about a stimulus person's beliefs in the area of personal values is made available, similarity or dissimilarity in beliefs is the primary determinant of attitudes of white gentiles toward Negroes and Jews. These results also hold for Negro and Jewish students' attitudes towards members of the majority. Only secondarily does racial or religious affiliation per se, or high versus low relative socioeconomic status, influence the students' feelings (friendliness measure) and action orientations (social distance scale) toward others. In response to individual social distance items, gentile Ss showed relative unwillingness to interact with Negroes as compared with whites in ""sensitive"" areas of interracial contact. Similar results, but to a much lesser degree, were obtained for anticipated interaction with Jewish stimulus persons. Gentile Ss' responses on another occasion to an otherwise undescribed ""Negro teenager"" correlated substantially with their responses to a lower status Negro to whom values unlike their own were ascribed. Other data indicate strong race and religion effects and a weaker status effect in the absence of information about stimulus persons' beliefs.

At these ages, the white children showed the traditional pattern: girls were far more romantically oriented than boys although at about the same level in terms of actual heterosexual interaction. Negro boys, however, showed a high level of preadolescent heterosexual interest and involvement together with an apparent progressive disenchantment with marriage.

The Japanese and 9 Chinese students made significantly fewer statements rated as bigoted and were more willing to accept members of other ethnic ancestries. However, they did not differ significantly from the Caucasians in extrapunitiveness.

Included also are analyses of atypical partners as those of Mexican-American background, age, education, and other factors. The author concludes that the prognosis for inter-racial marriages already established, and the growth of others, does not appear favorable.

In ""Laboratory Practices Develop Citizenship Concepts of High-School Students,"" Frederic L. Ayer and Bernard R. Corman summarize the results of a series of studies showing the activities adolescents identify with excellent and poor citizens, and how a method of guided experience in citizenship helps them increase their awareness of the responsibilities and activities that citizenship in a democracy entails.

In ""Some Personality and Social Factors Related to Changes in Children's Attitudes Toward Negroes,"" Paul H. Mussen analyzes the reasons some white boys increased in prejudice toward Negro boys, whereas others decreased in prejudice, after both groups, comprising about an equal number of whites and Negroes, had had four weeks of intimate contact at an interracial summer camp. In the second part of the study, Mussen describes how he assessed the reliability and validity of the attitude test used in measuring the prejudice of the boys. (From Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 1950, 45, 423-441, 504-506. Reprinted by permission of the author and of the American Psychological Association, Inc.). In ""College Experience and Attitude Development,"" Theodore M. Newcome examines what changes in attitudes on public issues occur in a group over a period of years in a specific environment. Newcomb studied a series of entering Bennington College freshmen through their senior year. He found that although the majority of the girls became more liberal during their successive years of attendance at the college, some showed no change from their earlier conservatism, and a few actively resisted the ""liberalism"" of the ""local atmosphere."" An explanation is offered for these differences-namely, that although all the girls had membership in the college group, the attitude development of each girl was a function not only of the way she related to the college membership group but also of her identification with off-campus reference groups which provided support for her conservative attitudes.

This book reports the first of a program of studies in intergroup relations being conducted by the Research Center for Human Relations at New York University. It is an impressive piece of research that will contribute significantly to the growing stockpile of knowledge about intergroup relations, as well as provide a sound factual basis for guiding official policy decisions relating to the occupancy pattern of new and existing public projects. Essentially, the study is a comparative evaluation of two types of public interracial housing projects: ""Integrated"" (where white and Negro families live as neighbors in the same apartment buildings) and ""Segregated"" (where Negro and white families live in different buildings or in different parts of the project). According to the reviewer, laudable features of the book are its neatness of organization and readable style. Tables are clear and introduced at the right places; footnotes actually amplify as they should, and succinct summaries appear at the end of each chapter. The book is almost a model illustration of how social scientists can contribute effectively toward the solution of critical problems of our day.

These types of social movements should be regarded as divisions of a continuous series and should be considered with respect to a collective action continuum in the dominant group which would run from reactionary to revolutionary. When racial accommodation is in the process of breaking down ""there occur forms of collective action, primarily types of social movements, which ultimately involve both dominant and subordinate groups."" These may be both interracial and non-racial. Interracial movements are fundamentally concerned with the social consequences of the incomplete merger of 2 societies and each interracial movement is composed of different combinations of persons of the 2 groups, the coexistence of which introduces new axes of inter-group conflict. These interracial movements which develop rivalry and conflict among themselves are yet mutually beneficial and the fact of their co-existence is an element in the social change process.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(create) The discussion of education and of democracy in Chapters 16 and 17 has emphasized primarily problems which are common to the human family, regardless of those biological cleavages of race and sex which must be fully considered if the ultimate orchestration of humanity is to be achieved; and Chapter 18, on the role of the churches, took for granted the common problems of all races and of all men and women sharing a religious outlook. It has nevertheless been characteristic of autocracy in general, and of Fascism in particular, to weaken the will to democracy by emphasizing differences rather than uniformities, and in particular, by emphasizing inequalities and prestige categories, rather than the common human attributes which are characteristically precious to one of democratic faith. Whenever inborn differences between groups are emphasized, it is easy to believe one's own group superior, the other inferior. Historically, all sorts of human exploitation, including slavery, have arisen in this context; even a morally sophisticated society can rationalize its ""inborn differences"" into justification to oppress. It is necessary, therefore, before completing our survey of the practical opportunities for democracy, to consider just how the inequality of opportunity between races and the social inequality of the sexes play their part to impede the development of the democratic spirit, as well as to emphasize in a positive way the psychological findings as to race and sex which serve as the basis for a positive faith in an equalitarian and humanistic peace. Turning first to the problem of race, I asked Dr. Kenneth B. Clark: What are those fundamental principles the recognition of which is essential to a wise handling of interracial problems? Emphasizing the need for exact research on sex differences, both biological and social, as an approach to our problem, I put to Dr. Georgene H. Seward the question: What are the essential factors to be blueprinted in a democratic definition of sex roles?

The discussion of the various population trends, as shown by these figures, is based, however, on Dr. Adams' own observations and experience as professor of sociology in the University of Hawaii, and leads directly to an interesting interpretation of the customs and attitudes of the various ethnic groups resident there. It is primarily a sociological document, but contains considerable material of value to social psychologists. The reviewer concludes that Adams' observations are characterized by shrewdness, common sense, and scientific detachment.

First, it proposes to make comparisons, disregarding race, for several disorders and disorder groupings with respect to the following factors: (a) age of patients at the time of first admission; (b) distribution of first admissions within given clinical categories expressed as percentages of total first admissions, by age levels; (c) standard rates of first admission, disregarding age levels; (d) deaths per 100 resident patients; (e) duration of hospital residence prior to death for patients dying at the hospital; (f) age at the time of death of patients dying at the hospital. The second purpose is that of making pertinent interracial comparisons with respect to each of the above factors, in each of the several clinical categories selected for special study. In securing the data bearing on these factors the general procedure was as follows: Selected data from the Annual Reports of the Georgia State Hospital for the Insane were tabulated for each of the years 1923-32, inclusive, and averages were computed for the decade. The findings herein reported, incomplete and imperfect as they admittedly are, appear to the writer to have considerable psychiatric and social significance. However, it is suggested that the chief significance of this study lies in the fact that it has revealed research leads relative to marked racial differences in mental disorders which are worthy of further detailed study. The present data do not justify the assumption of a constitutional inferiority among Negroes, nor do they prove that the differences are due to racial discrimination or exploitation.

The tests used in these investigations were principally standard group intelligence tests of the language type, which reflect very markedly the different social, cultural, and educational backgrounds of the subjects. In this investigation the Peterson Rational Learning Test was used, an ideational learning test which seems to draw little on past experience and training, and which stimulates the subjects to approximately maximal effort throughout the performance. The subjects of the present study were students of the various Indian schools of North Dakota and of one school on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Eastern Montana. The degrees of Indian blood represented by the subjects were obtained from the government records. Positive values indicate that the mixed bloods excel while negative values show full blood superiority. Unless a minus sign appears before a figure, the value will be assumed to be positive. In other words, as the tests become more and more of the informational and achievement nature, the differences increasingly favor the mixed blood; or, conversely, as the tests depend more and more on basic learning and manipulative abilities, the differences between the two groups tend to disappear.

These are: (1) struggle for existence, (2) absence of an intellectual class who devote their time to the advancement of knowledge, (3) a short life span, with consequent lack of intellectual maturity, (5) lack of language development, (6) lack of objective documentation by which results of experience could be preserved and by which others could profit, and (7) the limited possibilities of reaction in comparatively simple surroundings. Conclusions follow that differential racial abilities are not quantitatively explainable, and that, moreover, the genetic approach (now over-emphasized) has serious limitations.

From the time of Linnaeus, the taxonomic viewpoint became prominent and gave rise first to efforts at the classification of races and then to the measurement of race differences. Within recent decades, there has been a trend toward a cultural point of view, and the corresponding method has been one of search for cultural facts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Selective survival of groups as well as selective survival within groups must be considered in the study of man. The operation of selection within groups is conditioned largely by social forces. Conflict, as a factor in the evolution of the human species, has been replaced by more peaceful means with the growth of civilization. Following the white man's subjugation of other races in various parts of the globe there has been found a striking decrease in numbers and often a complete extinction of the primitive groups. White domination, however, has accelerated race fusion and in many parts of the world has recently come to exert an important influence in promoting the increase of native peoples. The widespread depopulation ""may be only a temporary phase characteristic of what we may call the exploring and settling stage in the development of interracial relationships."" An increase in some of these primitive populations is found at present, and the causes may be traced to the changing relationships of native races to the dominant whites or other ruling peoples. The realization that the native populations are a valuable economic resource which it pays to conserve has cut down conflicts and increased wise administration. The adjustment of the natives to the economic and social organization of the more advanced races has resulted in symbiosis replacing hostility. ""The student of the present evolution of our own species must concern himself not merely with the struggle between individuals or even neighboring groups, but with far reaching influences which tie together in bonds of common interest peoples of remote extraction. And along with these new relationships of interdependence are developing new kinds of rivalry whose outcome can be only dimly foreseen.""

The reviewer states that Dr. Eastman has given much valuable material for the psychologist, although designed primarily for his young son, as a record of his father's boyhood. Dr. Eastman has the double advantage of both an Indian's and a white man's education, and so he is able to tell of Indian life not only from the inside but from the outside.

Authored Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Race intermixture is much more common than is generally believed, owing to that ethnologic error consequent on the discovery of Sanscrit, which tests race by speech. As the intermingling of races began early, the question of the existence of pure races today, or even during the historic period, is an open one. The influence of race intermixture in the production of degeneracy is easily settled. Basing their opinion on the notorious sterility of the hybrid offspring of the horse and ass, certain biologists have assumed like results in man and have cited the alleged absence of Australian half-breeds in evidence. Since the hare and rabbit, dog and wolf, sheep and goat produce breeds intermediate between the parents, fertile while environment is unchanged, horse and ass sterility cannot be accepted as of much value in settling the question. Recent researches have shown that the half-breeds which survived birth among the Australians were killed in accordance with tribal usages regulating population in accordance with food supply. Whether the results of race intermixture prove degenerate or not will turn largely on the environment.
