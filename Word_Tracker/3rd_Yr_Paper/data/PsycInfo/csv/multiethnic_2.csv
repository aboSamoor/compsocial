Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We examined the factorial validity and dimensionality of the Stress-Related Growth Scale (SRGS; Park, Cohen, & Murch, 1996) using a large multiethnic sample (n = 1,070). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested that a multidimensional representation of the SRGS fit better than a unidimensional representation. Specifically, we cross-validated both a 3-factor model and a 7-factor model using confirmatory factor analysis and were shown to be invariant across gender and ethnic groups. The 3-factor model was represented by global dimensions of growth that included rational/mature thinking, affective/emotional growth, and religious/spiritual growth. We replicated the 7-factor model of Armeli, Gunthert, and Cohen (2001) and it represented more specific components of growth such as Self-Understanding and Treatment of Others. However, some factors of the 7-factor model had questionable internal consistency and were strongly intercorrelated, suggesting redundancy. The findings support the notion that the factor structure of both the original 1 -factor and revised 7-factor models are unstable and that the 3-factor model developed in this research has more reliable psychometric properties and structure.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Quality of life (QOL) is increasingly assessed in cancer patients. In this article, the authors examined the psychometric performance of a commonly used QOL questionnaire, the Quality of Life Questionnaire--Cancer 30 (QLQ-C30; N. K. Aaronson et al., 1993), in multiethnic cancer patients. Content validation studies in patients and clinicians identified possible new items. Multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis supported equivalent structure across ethnic groups (Caucasians and Asian/Pacific Islanders [APIs]). A higher order QOL factor appeared to directly affect functioning scales and symptom count. Exploratory factor analysis examined effects of new items. Ten factors were extracted, 6 consistent with the original instrument and 4 reflecting potentially new aspects of QOL: Positive Social Support, Coping, Existential Well-Being, and Sexuality/Intimacy. The QLQ-C30 appears appropriate for use in API cancer patients. Further work needs to ensure that it includes all important domains.

Content validity was judged to be fairly comparable by three raters in Study 1. In Study 2, convergent and divergent validity support was obtained for all four questionnaires when administered to 369 multiethnic college students, but the relative degree of support varied across constructs. Hence, selection of a self-control instrument may be guided by the target behavior of interest.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Rates of depression and anxiety in south Asian populations are lower than expected. It remains uncertain whether this reflects a real difference in prevalence or differences in case recognition and management. Objective: To examine whether concordance of culture or ethnicity between doctors and patients affects the prescribing rates for antidepressant and anxiolytic medications in general practice populations, taking into account demography, practice size and organization. Method: A cross-sectional general practice study, using practice and demographic data from primary care trusts, doctors' place of qualification from the General Medical Council, combined with practice level prescribing data from the prescription pricing authority (PACT) for the period 2000-2002. Set in 139 practices in the east London primary care trusts (PCTs) of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham, multiethnic areas with large populations of south Asian residents and doctors. The main outcome measure was the annual prescribing rates for each group of drugs, calculated as the mean of two years average daily quantities (ADQs) for each medication, divided by the practice population. Results: In east London the median prescribing rate (ADQs) for all antidepressants was 7.97 (inter-quartile range 4.91-10.76), for all anxiolytics and hypnotics 2.27 (interquartile range 1.11-3.96). There were significant differences in prescribing rates between practices with UK trained GPs and practices with south Asian trained GPs, with the highest rates of antidepressant prescribing in practices with UK trained GPs and low proportions of south Asian patients. No differences were found in anxiolytic and hypnotic prescribing rates between these practices. 57% of the variation in prescribing between practices could be explained by a model including the place of GP qualification, the proportion of registered women, older (>65) patients, and the list size per full time GP. Conclusions: Compared with previous studies prescribing rates for antidepressants have almost doubled over five years, the greatest increase being for selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). There is a modest fall in prescribing rates for anxiolytics and hypnotics. Concordance between south Asian practice populations and doctors from similar south Asian cultures is not associated with an increase in antidepressant prescribing. Lower rates of prescribing in practices with south Asian trained doctors occur regardless of the ethnic composition of the practice population. Reasons for these differences are uncertain, but may include differences in explanatory models for presenting symptoms, and management strategies which rely less on a biomedical paradigm.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Smoking is a major public health risk and information regarding high-risk groups is needed to plan, implement and evaluate interventions aimed at lowering the number of smokers. Methods: During the years 1999-2001 data was collected regarding the smoking behaviour of the Israeli population in three national surveys. All three surveys included ages 25-64 and two included also ages 21-25 and over 64. Results: Smoking was associated with age, sex, ethnicity, education and religiosity after adjusting for the various demographic characteristics of the survey population. The prevalence of smoking among Arab and immigrant men from the former Soviet Union is higher than among Jewish men. Among women the opposite association exists. The older, religious and more educated reported smoking less frequently. In the Jewish population respondents, defining themselves as secular, reported higher rates of smoking. Only in women was marital status associated with smoking. A few specific high-risk groups for smoking can be identified such as young, less educated men, Arab men, single Jewish women and young immigrant men and women. Conclusions: The three ethnic groups residing in Israel differ in the prevalence of smoking; each has a distinct pattern of smoking, positioning them at different stages within the conceptual framework of the larger smoking pandemic. Ethnicity, religiosity, age and education are associated with smoking in both sexes. This calls for specific tailored interventions aimed at younger men with less education, Arab men, and young immigrants.

This was a qualitative study using focus groups. Subjects were drawn from three existing community groups in Tower Hamlets, a multiethnic, socially deprived borough in east London. Thematic content analysis was used to explore and present the data. Many women received little practical or emotional support once home from hospital with a new baby, because of the lack of extended family networks; this contrasts with the 40 day rest period common in Bangladesh. These women understood emotional distress as separate from physical symptoms or illness, and recognized that one may influence or cause the other. Distinctive language was used to describe these thoughts and feelings. The roles of health visitors, midwives and GPs were understood solely in terms of physical care. Accordingly, they did not access professionals for emotional or psychological problems. Lack of language support services contributed to the women not seeking help. Information about services, and professional roles in the postnatal period should be extended to include key family members such as husbands and mothers-in-law...

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study examined the feasibility of using cellular telephones to improve access to smoking cessation counseling in a low-income, HIV-positive population. Two pilot studies were conducted: (a) A survey of interest and barriers in participating in a smoking cessation intervention (n=49) and (b) a cellular telephone smoking cessation intervention in which participants were provided with free cellular telephones and received six telephone counseling sessions over a 2-week period (n = 20). A primary care clinic serving a multiethnic, medically indigent, HIV-positive population served as the setting. Demographics and smoking status were assessed by self-report and expired-air carbon monoxide testing. In study 1, participants reported multiple barriers to participating in a smoking cessation intervention, including transportation, transience, and telephone availability. However, they also reported a high level of interest in participating in a smoking cessation intervention, with the greatest interest in a cellular telephone intervention. In study 2, 19 of the 20 participants successfully completed 2 weeks of smoking cessation counseling with a 93% (106 of 114 calls) contact rate. A total of 19 participants made a quit attempt, and the 2-week end of treatment point-prevalence abstinence rate was 75%. The provision of cellular telephones allowed for the implementation of a proactive telephone smoking cessation intervention providing an underserved population with access to care. Cellular telephones also may provide unique benefits because of the intensity of counseling and support provided as well as the ability to provide counseling in real-world, real-time situations (in vivo counseling).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The aim of this study was to describe smoking prevalence and smoking behavior in a multiethnic low-income HIV/AIDS population. A cross-sectional survey design was used. The study site was Thomas Street Clinic, an HIV/AIDS care facility serving a medically indigent and ethnically diverse population. The HIV exposure profile of the sample was diverse: 46% men who have sex with men, 35% heterosexual contact, and 11% injection drug use. Among participants with a lifetime history of smoking 100 or more cigarettes (62.8%), only 26.6% were currently abstinent, lower than the 48.8% rate seen in the general population. The results indicated that race/ethnicity, education level, age, and heavy drinking were significantly associated with smoking status. Hispanics were less likely than Whites were to smoke, younger participants were less likely than older participants were to be current smokers, and heavy drinkers were more likely to be current smokers than were those who were not heavy drinkers. As education level increased, the likelihood of smoking decreased and the likelihood of quitting increased. The high smoking prevalence in this HIV/AIDS population demonstrates the need for smoking cessation interventions targeted to the special needs of this patient group.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: This evaluative study assessed the effect of a creative expression program designed to prevent emotional and behavioral problems and to enhance self-esteem in immigrant and refugee children attending multiethnic schools. Method: The 12-week program involved 138 children, aged 7 to 13, registered in both integration classes designed for immigrant children and regular classes at two elementary schools. Pretest and posttest data were collected from the children themselves and from their teacher. Teachers used Achenbach's Teacher's Report Form to assess the emotional and behavioral symptoms of their pupils whereas children self-reported their symptoms with the Dominic, a computerized questionnaire. Self-esteem was measured with the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale administered by interviewers to the children. Results: At the end of the program, the children in the experimental groups reported lower mean levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and higher mean levels of feelings of popularity and satisfaction than the children in the control groups, when controlling for baseline data. In integration classes, the effect on self-esteem was especially notable in boys. The intervention's effect on internalizing and externalizing symptoms was not modified by gender, age or fluency in the mainstream language. Conclusion: The study provides some evidence that creative workshops in the classroom can have a beneficial effect on the self-esteem and symptomatology of immigrant and refugee children from various cultures and backgrounds. These quantitative results support previous qualitative analysis showing that the workshops participate in the reconstruction of a meaningful personal world while simultaneously strengthening the link of the child to the group. They also transform the teachers' perceptions of newcomers by placing an emphasis on their strength and their resilience, while not negating their vulnerabilities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper describes a conceptual approach to understanding the impact of marital violence on preschoolers, examines the predictors and mediators of child behavioral problems in a clinical sample of multiethnic preschoolers who witnessed their mothers' battering by their father figure, and presents empirical evidence supporting the use of relationship-based therapeutic modalities in treating preschoolers exposed to violence. We find that exposure to violence and maternal life stress are each predictive of child behavior problems, and that the impact of maternal life stress on child behavior problems is mediated by maternal psychopathology and the quality of the mother-child relationship.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The basic social processes invoked by the terms race, racism, and discrimination are quintessentially social psychological phenomena. These concepts concern the meanings of social groupings and how those meanings come to guide patterns of relations among individuals recognized as members of particular groups. A key challenge for scholarship in this area is to reach beyond the boundaries of customary and specific research problems, methodologies, and theories. To further advance the impetus toward ""bridging,"" this special issue now unites three goals in seeking to increase social psychology's understanding of processes of race, racism, and discrimination: to encourage bridges across major subareas, methods, and theories; encourage work of multiethnic scope; and to highlight work that adopts a target-group or minority-group frame of reference.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"C. A. Kearney and W. K. Silverman (1993) developed the School Refusal Assessment Scale (SRAS) to assess the function of and to prescribe treatment for school refusal behavior. The present investigation examined the psychometric properties and clinical utility of the SRAS in a multiethnic sample. Participants were 30 children and their mothers who were identified as school refusers after an initial screening. Results indicate that scales measuring negatively reinforced school refusal were intercorrelated, whereas scales measuring positively reinforced school refusal were not. Concurrent validity of dimensional and categorical scoring algorithms was examined. Although parent-child agreement was relatively low, validity analyses suggested that each reporter contributed important information. Clinical implications and areas for future research were discussed.

Pearson correlation analyses were performed to determine whether BMI scores were related to self- and body-dissatisfaction and the relationship between self- and body-dissatisfaction. BMI was highly correlated with body and self-dissatisfaction for males and females. Males appeared more satisfied than females with the body and more diverse in choice of larger or smaller ideal body type. Highly significant BMI/ethnic group differences emerged. White males were large (high BMI) but very satisfied with body and self. Filipino males were the largest of all male groups but followed a female pattern of strong body/self-dislike and preference for smaller body. Chinese females were small and highly satisfied with body/self whereas Japanese females were small but highly dissatisfied with body/self. Study clearly demonstrates Asian ethnic subgroup differences in BMI and body/self dissatisfaction.

Kurelek's art struck a chord with Canadian consciousness. He became known as the people's painter, capturing the lives of the Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish, and Irish immigrants who settled in multiethnic Canada. To his biographer he remains an enigma. To the art critic, he could be taken seriously as an outsider artist; outsider artists are typically self-absorbed, oblivious to convention, and preoccupied with detail. He worked at a frenzied pace, producing a tremendous body of work ranging from criticism of abortion to his famous series, Passion of Christ.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"There is a growing concern that governmental calls for parental involvement in children's school mathematics learning have not been underpinned by research. In this article the authors aim to offer a contribution to this debate. Links between children's home and school mathematical practices have been researched in sociocultural studies, but the origins of differences within the same cultural group are not well understood. The authors have explored the notion that parents' representations of school mathematics and associated practices at home may play a part in the development of these differences. This article reports an analysis of interviews with parents of 24 children of Pakistani and White origin enrolled in primary schools in England, including high and low achievers in school mathematics. The extent to which the parents represented their own school mathematics and their child's school mathematics as the 'same' or 'different' are examined. In addition, ways in which these representations influenced how they tried to support their children's learning of school mathematics are examined. The article concludes with reflections on the implications of the study for education policy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We utilize the concepts of individualism and collectivism (or communitarianism) to understand group differences and longitudinal change in what it means to belong to a team, itself a communal context. Our setting is two multiethnic high school girls' basketball teams in southern California. Players were asked to keep journals documenting experiences of interpersonal harmony and conflict in the team setting. Earlier analysis indicated that the experience of playing on a team made players more collectivistic in response to a values questionnaire. How did this change come about? Here we use player journals to answer this question. The journals also show that the process of value change differs depending on whether players interpret the issues surrounding team building through an individualistic or a collectivistic lens. Individualistic journals were more likely to be written by players having at least one European American or African American parent and by Asian American and Latina players having at least one parent born in the United States, whereas they were less likely to be written by Asian American or Latina players from purely immigrant families. However, perhaps because of the situational press towards collectivism in the team context, a collectivistic orientation in player journals was not associated with a particular set of ethnic backgrounds.

Data were collected over 3 years from participants (N = 16,146) in the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) in New York State who either graduated or terminated involvement prior to graduation. Both groups had a significant decrease in food insecurity score (p < .05) from pre- to posteducation. The difference between the graduated and terminated groups approached statistical significance using a t-test comparison (p = .055). A multiple regression analysis indicated that food insecurity score decreased significantly more in graduates (p < .001). A dose response relationship was seen between the number of lessons received and decreases in food insecurity. Programs that educate low-income families in food selection and resource management skills can decrease the risk of food insecurity, although effects vary by sociodemographic characteristics of participants and program delivery methods.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study explored youths' and parents' perceptions of family interaction processes as well as the broader social and cultural factors that influence family functioning in a multiethnic sample of inner-city families with delinquent youth. In-depth interviews were conducted with 61 male youths (aged 13-18 yrs) and 33 parents (27 mothers, 4 fathers, 2 grandmothers; mean age 68.5 yrs) predominantly from minority families. Guided by an ecological framework, qualitative data analyses were employed to explore individual and contextual factors that were perceived either to foster or to impede individual and family functioning. Findings supported previous empirical research highlighting the importance of family interaction processes in the lives of delinquent youths. Analysis of parent and youth data revealed important relationships among the individual, family, and community domains. The emphases placed on these interrelationships, however varied in distinct and notable ways for parents and youths. The implications of these divergent patterns for family-level interventions are addressed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article used school-level data from the Schools and Staffing Survey and the California Department of Education to assess the extent to which African Americans versus non-Hispanic whites attend schools with children with limited English proficiency (LEP) and tested ecological theoretical expectations about spatial patterns arising within the context of multiethnic, multiracial communities. All individuals aged 5-20 who were enrolled in grades K-12 were included in the sample. In areas with few immigrants, LEP students do not ""crowd"" the schools attended by most African American and non-Hispanic white children. In areas with a significant LEP population, a pattern of segregation emerges between non-Hispanic white students, on the one hand, and LEP and African American students, on the other. In California, LEP students are represented in schools attended by average African Americans at about twice the level as schools attended by average non-Hispanic whites. At the same time, non-Hispanic whites are greatly underrepresented in African American students' schools. This pattern is particularly strong in metropolitan statistical areas and school districts where the LEP student population reaches about 10 percent, even after MSA and district composition are taken into account.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In an urban middle school, 406 students (mean age 12.4 yrs) including 116 African American (68 girls and 48 boys), 118 Latino (59 girls and 59 boys), and 172 students from four other ethnic groups (labeled multiethnic; 83 girls and 89 boys) completed nomination procedures that identified classmates who were perceived as aggressive or as victims of peer harassment. Peer acceptance and rejection also were measured by nomination procedures, and participants reported their self-perceived loneliness, social anxiety, and global self-esteem. Compared to Latino and multiethnic respondents, more African American students were nominated as aggressive, and fewer were nominated as victims of harassment. However, African American harassment victims reported more loneliness and lower self-esteem than did harassment victims in the other ethnic groups, and they were more rejected by peers. The data were interpreted as evidence that deviations from normative perceptions of a person's group (i.e., being a victim of harassment when the perceived group norm is aggressiveness) are particularly detrimental to psychological and social adjustment.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Self-reported substance use and delinquent behavior were assessed yearly, 3 times beginning in the sixth or seventh grade, for a multiethnic sample of middle school students (n = 5,045). Both substance use and delinquent behavior became more prevalent across early adolescence, but only a small fraction of adolescents were using illicit substances at the end of the study. The proportion of adolescents reporting neither substance use nor delinquent behavior dropped significantly in contrast to the proportion reporting both behaviors. Co-occurring problem behaviors were associated with significantly higher mean levels of each behavior, with increasing group differences over time. In addition, more persistent copatterning of substance use and delinquency was associated with significantly higher levels of nearly every indicator of these problem behaviors at Year 3.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In most multiethnic developing societies, the state attempts to play a crucial role in managing ethnic tensions and reconciling diverse ethnic interests by undertaking relevant policies and programs. Malaysia is a classic case where there is a coexistence of some major ethnic groups with distinct identities and where the state has used wide-ranging preferential policies to manage ethnic problems. In fact, the formation of the state itself is largely founded upon ethnic politics and characterized as an ""ethnocratic state"" or ""ethnic democracy."" This article examines the origin and rationale of ethnic preferences, major domains of ethnic contestation and state intervention, critical impacts of such ethnic preferential policies, and possibilities to replace such preferential policies by alternative policy measures in Malaysia.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Inhibition of emotional expression has been associated with the incidence and progression of breast cancer and other chronic illnesses. Others have theorized that it may not be repression itself, but rather ambivalence over the expression of emotions that is the important health-related factor. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a long-term, national study focusing on disease prevention among postmenopausal women, is unique in its assessment of expression and ambivalence of negative emotion in a large study sample of multiethnic, older women. Psychological factors such as expression of negative emotion and ambivalence about expression of emotion are also determined by social patterning. The current study examined the psychometric properties of the instruments used to measure each construct and variation across race/ethnicity and age. The analysis suggests that the scales can be used with confidence in diverse ethnic and age groups. Examining ambivalence about expression of negative emotion in future longitudinal research will further elucidate its role in predicting disease incidence and recovery, both important in reducing the public health burden of chronic disease.

The sample consisted of 7,443 women, aged 18-44 years, receiving care at urban, primary health care clinics in southern Texas. White women disclosed abuse at a rate of 8.9%, followed by African American women at 6.0% and Hispanic women at 5.3%.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Prevention of youth smoking has great potential to improve the health of Americans. There is limited information about correlates of tobacco use among adolescents from ethnic minority groups, especially Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Hawaiians. Purpose: This article examines the relationships among ethnicity, sense of coherence (SOC), and tobacco use. Methods: We conducted a baseline survey of a cluster randomized tobacco prevention trial in public middle schools in Hawaii with a multiethnic sample of 3,438 seventh-grade students. Results: Ethnic differences in smoking prevalence were very large, with high smoking rates among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, White, and Filipino students and with low rates among Japanese and Chinese students. Higher SOC scores predicted significantly lower risk of having ever smoked and of smoking in the past 30 days. SOC was most strongly related to ever smoking among Filipino, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and White students; Japanese students experienced the strongest protective effect from SOC for past-month smoking. Conclusions: The results suggest that SOC is strongly associated with tobacco use among this age group. It will be important to examine whether SOC can be improved by an intervention program and whether increases in SOC are associated with reduced smoking.

The response rate was 85%. The respondents were from three ethnic groups in northern Norway: indigenous Sami, Kvens and Norwegians. Females' mean scores were higher than males' scores for Total Problems, Internalising Problems, the Internalising syndrome scales and the Attention Problems scale. Males' mean scores were higher than females' scores for Delinquent Behaviour. There were few differences between the ethnic groups, but Sami had higher scores than Nor Norwegians for the Withdrawn and Social Problems syndromes. Parental status was weakly associated with Total Problems, Internalising and Externalising Problems, while age, socioeconomic status and urban/rural location were not associated with the problem scales. Results for Anxiety-depression (SCL-12) and Conduct Problems were compared with a national representative adolescent sample (n=4567), showing slight differences between the samples in Anxiety-depression and no significant differences in Conduct Problems.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: Adolescent smoking has been associated with stressful life events. However, few studies have examined the associations between stress, smoking intentions, and smoking behavior among a multiethnic sample of adolescents. Methods: We compiled a checklist of stressful life events relevant to multiethnic youth and administered it to 1,074 sixth-grade students in urban Los Angeles. Results: The most frequently reported stressful events were similar across ethnic groups and generations in the USA: test taking, chores, and arguments with friends. The events reported as the most severe were disturbances in family life, such as: death, arguments between parents, and illness or injury. Whites and Latinos had reported higher levels of ever smoking and intentions to smoke than Asian/Pacific Islanders (PIs). On the positive family-related events scale Latinos scored higher than did whites or Asian/PIs. Whites scored higher than Latinos or Asian/PIs on both negative peer-related and negative personal-related events. Associations were observed between total stress, stressful life events, and smoking behavior and intention to smoke. Total stress was associated with ever smokers, smoking intentions within the next year and in high school over the entire sample. Negative peer-related events were associated with intention to smoke within the next year, among Latinos. Among Asian/PIs negative peer-related events were associated with intention to smoke within the next year and in high school. Negative school-related events were significantly associated with ever smoking and intentions to smoke in the next year and marginally associated with intentions to smoke in high school among children born in the USA whose parents were also born in the USA. Negative peer-related events and positive personal-related events were significantly associated with intentions to smoke in the next year among children born in the USA whose parents were immigrants. Conclusions: Results suggest that negative peer- and school-related events may lead to increased risk of smoking behavior and intentions to smoke among multicultural adolescents.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study documents significant associations among lifetime abuse experiences, psychiatric diagnoses, and sexual risk behaviors in a multiethnic community sample of young men and women (N=1803) in South Florida. Self-report data were collected via structured interviews as part of a longitudinal follow-up of a larger school-based study. Participants were grouped according to extent of lifetime abuse experiences. Cumulative lifetime abuse experiences were associated with increased risk for a broad range of individual lifetime psychiatric disorders, as well as cumulative lifetime psychiatric disorders. Both cumulative abuse experiences and cumulative psychiatric disorders were independently associated with (1) higher levels of sexual risk behaviors and (2) higher risk for lifetime sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Implications for selective prevention of sexual risk behaviors and STDs among young adults with histories of abuse and psychiatric disorders are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Little is known about the experiences of women from varying ethnic groups following treatment for breast cancer. Purpose: This study provides a comprehensive description of heath-related quality of life (HRQL) and identifies problem areas and predictive factors for a multiethnic sample. Methods: Six hundred twenty-one breast cancer survivors from 2 major cities participated within 5 years of their diagnosis. Participants were African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Whites. Patients filled out questionnaire packets comprising standardized instruments related to HRQL, psychological adjustment, cancer-related treatment, and demographic variables. Data were analyzed using 2 methods: (a) observation of findings prior to controlling for demographic and treatment variables and (b) observation of findings after controlling for variables confounded with ethnicity. Results: Findings indicate that most women experienced good HRQL. Group differences revealed that African Americans found more meaning in life as a result of having breast cancer, and Latinas reported more physical symptoms. Age predicted aspects of HRQL for African Americans and Whites. Conclusions: This study comprehensively assessed HRQL following breast cancer for ethnic minority women. Most breast cancer survivors in this study reported levels of HRQL comparable to established norms. However, some quality of life impediments surfaced in particular groups. Researchers should not assume that predictive models of breast cancer HRQL are the same across ethnic groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The role of parental support, hostile campus racial climate, and sense of belonging to campus in predicting psychological adjustment and drug use was examined in a sample of 319 African American and White college freshmen. No ethnic-group differences were found for mean levels of parental support, racial hostility, belonging to campus, or psychological adjustment. White adolescents reported higher levels of drug and alcohol use than did African American adolescents. Drug use was related to anxiety and depression for White adolescents but not for African American adolescents. For both ethnic groups, higher perceptions of racial hostility were related to higher levels of adjustment problems and binge drinking. Higher levels of parental support were related to lower levels of depression and loneliness for both ethnic groups. Modest support for belonging to campus as a mediator between parental support and hostile racial climate and the outcomes was found, with more evidence for African American adolescents than for White adolescents.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Depression, alcohol use, and suicidal behaviors are common problems among adolescents in the United States. Little is known about how these problem behaviors differ among adolescent, multiethnic females. In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, regression analyses were performed to determine differences in these adolescent problem behaviors among multiethnic females, using Latinas as the referent group. The random sample of 3,310 12-19 year olds included Latinas, and African-, Asian-, Native-, and Euro-American females. Measures included the CES-D, number of drinks each time alcohol was consumed in the past year, and a composite measure of suicidal behaviors. Latinas reported significantly higher risk for adolescent depression than did Euro-American peers and higher risk for alcohol use than did African- and Asian-American peers only. There were no significant differences in risk for suicidal behaviors between Latinas and their peers representing any of the other four ethnic groups. As adolescents of Latin, African, Asian, Native or aboriginal, and European ethnicity live all over the world, the findings inform future studies on adolescent depression, alcohol use, and suicidal behaviors among adolescents representing any of these ethnic groups in any part of the globe.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: Most previous longitudinal studies demonstrating relationships between psychosocial variables and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression utilized samples of gay men accrued before the era of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), without including viral load (VL) as an indicator of disease progression or assessing the impact of medication adherence. This study sought to determine whether psychosocial variables would predict both CD4 and VL changes in a diverse sample assessed entirely during the era of HAART and accounting for adherence effects. Methods: This longitudinal study assessed a multiethnic HIV+ sample (n=177) of men and women in the midrange of illness (CD4 number between 150 and 500; no previous acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-defining symptom) every 6 months for 2 years. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to model change in CD4 and VL controlling for sociodemographics (age, gender, ethnicity, education) and medical variables (baseline CD4/VL, antiretroviral medications at each time point, adherence). Results: Baseline depression, hopelessness, and education predicted the slope of CD4 and VL. Avoidant coping and life event stress predicted VL change. Cumulative variables produced stronger relationships (depression, avoidant coping, and hopelessness with CD4/VL slope and life events stress with VL slope). High cumulative depression and avoidant coping were associated with approximately twice the rate of decline in CD4 as low scorers and greater relative increases in VL. Social support was not significantly related to CD4 or VL slope. Conclusions: Psychosocial factors contribute significantly to the variance in HIV disease progression (assessed through CD4 number and VL) in a diverse sample, accounting for adherence and do so in the era of HAART.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Previous research has shown that meanings of smoking are highly predictive of smoking in middle school children. Three factors of meanings of smoking have been suggested in the literature: personal meanings, functional meanings, and social meanings. These conceptually derived factors of meanings of smoking have not previously been empirically studied. Purpose: This study examined the factor structure of the Meanings of Smoking Index (MSI) to determine the unique contribution of meanings of smoking and positive outcome expectancies to smoking behavior in middle school children. Methods: A multiethnic sample of 2,247 eighth-grade students enrolled in 24 middle schools in greater Los Angeles completed a paper-and-pencil survey in class. Results: Four factors of the MSI emerged (functional, personal, social image, and weight concern). Positive outcome expectancies and each of the four factors of the MSI predicted lifetime smoking in a multivariate model. Conclusions: Meanings of smoking were empirically distinct from positive outcome expectancies. Adolescents who endorsed personal and functional meanings were more likely to smoke. Social image and weight concern meanings were negatively related to smoking after controlling for all other meanings. Meanings of smoking may prove to be important and modifiable mediators of smoking and therefore useful in future prevention studies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Built on recent findings that (a) factors of the tripartite model in adults are not uniformly related to all anxiety disorder dimensions as recent research has suggested, and (b) the tripartite model of emotion appears to have increasing support and utility in child samples. The structural relations were evaluated among tripartite factors and dimensions representing selected anxiety disorders and depression in a large multiethnic school sample of children and adolescents (893 girls and 746 boys, aged 6.17-18.92 yrs). General aspects of the tripartite model were supported. For example, Negative Affect was positively related with all anxiety and depression scales, and Positive Affect was negatively correlated with the depression scale. Consistent with previous observations in adult samples, Physiological Hyperarousal was positively related with Panic only, and was not significantly positively correlated with other anxiety syndromes. The structure of the best fitting model appeared robust across different grade levels and gender. In follow-up analyses, several interactions of grade level with structural parameters emerged, such that the relation of some of the tripartite factors with anxiety and depression were noted to increase or decrease across grade level.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Sibling collusion is a process by which siblings form coalitions that promote deviance and undermine parenting. Collusive sibling processes were identified and measured using macro ratings of videotaped family interactions. Hypotheses were tested on a multiethnic sample of urban youth (males and females, aged 12-14 yrs), with a target child identified as either ""high risk"" (n = 26) or ""normative"" (n = 26), and their families. Siblings in families with a high-risk target child showed reliably higher rates of collusion than those in families with a normative target child. Sibling collusion also accounted for variance in problem behavior after controlling for involvement with deviant peers. Findings suggest that deviant conduct forms a common ground among siblings, potentially amplifying risk of mutuality in problem behavior during early adolescence. These data also indicate that attention to sibling relationship processes is relevant to family interventions designed to mitigate the development of behavior problems.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The international trend for large, corporately owned nightclubs that are similar around the globe is changing and homogenizing the public drinking cultures in many large cities. To better understand this phenomenon, we examined the different types of clubs in Toronto, Canada. The typology is drawn from qualitative and quantitative data compiled by trained observers who conducted 1,056 nights of unobtrusive observations in 75 high-capacity nightclubs. Ten club ""types"" were constructed using the genre of music as the primary distinction: Dance, Superclub, Rave, Lounge, Upscale, Pop, Salsa, Reggae-Rap, Alternative, and Live Music. These types roughly approximate different subcultures, and provided a means to explore differences related to age, gender, ethnicity patterns, and alcohol and drug usage, as well as the apparent functions for which patrons frequented the different types of clubs. The predominant pattern of the current club scene in Toronto is one of large, corporately owned clubs frequented by a youthful multiethnic clientele, with most club environments characterized by slick decor and heightened sexuality.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: We conducted this study to understand the interpretations of elder mistreatment (EM) in multiethnic older adults. Design and Methods: Focus group sessions were held with three ethnically homogenous groups (n = 18) and a group of eldercare professionals (n = 6) eliciting responses to vignettes depicting various types of elder mistreatment. Qualitative analysis of focus group transcripts was performed to define EM occurrence, its severity, and to identify the perpetrator and victim. Results: Four main categories emerged: social expectations, caregiver expectations, victim characteristics, and characteristics of the interaction. Themes included issues of gender roles, filial obligations, martial commitments, and ageism as features of the vignette discussions. Professional and lay caregiver issues were features of the caregiver expectations. Mental capacity, physical dependency, physical attributes, and complicity were the victim characteristics discussed. The characteristics of the interaction that were identified included resistance to care, retaliation, habitual occurrence, and perpetrator intent. Implications: Older adults identify multiple factors influencing the interpretation of elder mistreatment. These factors may determine strategies for future EM intervention.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Previous research suggests that self-derogation/rejection and peer factors are strongly related to adolescent substance use. However, much less is known about the role and significance of these risk factors in the escalation of drug use over time. In the current study, we examined whether early reports of self-derogation and peer approval prospectively predicted drug dependence. Data from three waves of a nine-year prospective study were employed to examine these relationships among a multiethnic sample of young adult males (N = 872). Analysis confirmed that self-derogation and peer approval of substance use independently predicted drug dependence even when early substance use was controlled. These findings underscore the utility of these factors in identifying high-risk individuals for prevention and early intervention efforts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: While information websites have been developed by major cancer organizations, their appropriateness for patients in multiethnic, multilingual public hospital settings has received limited attention. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the utility of cancer information websites for a public hospital patient population. Methods: A 70-item questionnaire was developed to evaluate cancer information seeking behavior, Internet access and use, and content appropriateness of two cancer information websites: People Living with Cancer from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Breast Cancer Info from the Susan Komen Breast Cancer Foundation (SKF). Interviews were conducted with consecutive consenting oncology patients seen in a public hospital oncology clinic. Results: Fifty-nine persons participated in the survey. The response rate was 80%. Participants were Caucasian (25%), African American (19%), Hispanic (42%), and Asian/Pacific Islander (11%). English was the primary language in 53% of participants, 56% had a high school education or less, and 74% had an annual income less than US $35000. With respect to computer and Internet use, 71% had computer access, and 44% searched for cancer information online, with more being interested in obtaining online information in the future (63%). Participants who had computer access were likely to be English speaking (P = .04). Those less likely to have previously used a computer tended to have a lower annual income (P = .02) or to be males aged 55 years or older (P < .05). When shown sample content from the two websites, almost all participants stated that it was ""easy to understand"" (ASCO 96%, SKF 96%) and had ""easy to understand terms"" (ASCO 94%, SKF 92%). Somewhat fewer respondents agreed that the websites provided ""information they could use"" (ASCO 88%, SKF 80%) or that they would return to these websites (ASCO 73%, SKF 68%). The majority planned to ""discuss website information with their oncologists"" (ASCO 82%, SKF 70%). Conclusions: Multiethnic, multilingual cancer patients at a public county hospital commonly had Internet access and found the content of two websites representative of major cancer organizations to be both understandable and useful.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study examined the association of racial climate to social integration outcomes among 215 African American students and 144 White students from a predominantly White university. Presented is preliminary evidence regarding the utility of an ecological approach based on Allport's (1954) intergroup contact theory in examining students' climate perceptions and their impact. Responses to a racial climate scale previously used in secondary settings were collected from participants, and, through factor analysis, a revised scale was developed. The revised scale showed evidence for five subscales assessing perceived intergroup interactions on campus at individual and institutional levels, as well as individuals' personal intergroup interactions. Group differences were found for the subscales and in relationships between subscales and college integration outcomes. Findings suggest the importance of understanding college climate at interpersonal and institutional levels and of assessing impact for both majority and minority students.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter is organised along the following lines. Firstly, a selective overview of the two theoretical positions underlying the terms 'speech community' and 'community of practice' is set out. Secondly, data from an ethnographic study of a multilingual London secondary school is presented, the bulk of which comes from two student-produced texts regarding an accusation of racism. Thirdly, a discussion section examines the descriptive and explanatory power the two different theoretical positions bring to explaining the ethnographic data from an urban multicultural and multilingual school.

This book consists of a series of studies by linguists and educational researchers, examining and developing aspects of the concept which have remained relatively unexplored. Framings provided by theories of language-in-use, literacy practices and discourse extend the concept, bringing to light issues around conflict, power and the significance of the broader social context which have been overlooked. Chapters assess the relationship between communities of practice and other theories, including literacy studies, critical language studies, the ethnography of communication, sociocultural activity theory and sociological theories of risk. Domains of empirical research reported include schools, police stations, adult basic education, higher education and multilingual settings. The book highlights the need to incorporate thinking around language-in-use, power and conflict and social context into communities of practice.

As patients with HIV/AIDS continue to live longer, other important health-related outcomes, such as quality of life (QOL), should be thoroughly studied. There is also evidence that racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, but potential health disparities among individuals already infected with HIV/AIDS have not been adequately examined in ethnically diverse populations. The purpose of this dissertation was to: (1) examine the impact of both demographic and behavioral variables on functional status and overall QOL among a population of ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged HIV/AIDS patients; (2) examine the psychometric properties of a functional status measure-the Household and Leisure Time Activities questionnaire (HLTA); and (3) assess a proximal-distal theoretical framework for QOL using a full structural equation model in a population of patients with HIV/AIDS. Analyses were performed using data collected in the fall of 2000 from the project, Health and Work-Related Quality of Life and Health Risk Behaviors in a Multiethnic HIV-positive Population . Investigators from The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas-Houston Medical School, and The University of Texas School of Public Health conducted this project. The study site was the Thomas Street Clinic (TSC), a comprehensive HIV/AIDS care facility funded by the Harris County Hospital District (HCHD). TSC provides HIV/AIDS care to a diverse population of approximately 4000 medically indigent residents of Harris County. A systematic, consecutive sampling procedure yielded a sample size of 348 patients. Findings suggested that overall QOL, work-role functioning, household functioning, and leisure time functioning were impaired in this patient population. Results from the psychometric evaluation indicated that the HLTA was a reliable and valid measure of household and leisure time functioning status in a low-income multiethnic HIV-positive population. Finally, structural equation modeling of the proximal-distal QOL model suggested that this model was not a viable representation of the relationship between the study variables in this patient population.

Four million American women experience an assault by an intimate partner during an average 12-month period. Women of all ethnicities, income levels and educational backgrounds suffer from intimate partner violence; however, some ethnic groups may be disproportionately affected by the experience of IPV. The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (2003) suggests the need for more comprehensive data collection on this problem, including data with regard to sociodemographic risk factors and the long-term indirect mental and physical health consequences over time for women who experience IPV. A longitudinal investigation of the physical health and mental health consequences of IPV in a multiethnic sample of women was conducted. Two questions were considered: (1) what are the differential sociodemographic risk factors for IPV among African Americans, Caucasians and Latinas? and (2) to what extent does IPV impact the physical and mental health of African American, Caucasian and Latina women over time, above and beyond, what can be explained by other life-stressors, such as poverty or histories of sexual trauma? Secondary data analysis probed these issues among 47 African American, 58 Caucasian and 52 Latina women. Results indicate that, while no ethnic differences in rates of IPV were found, socioeconomic status and sexual trauma history were related to the experience of IPV among ethnically diverse women. Additionally, ethnicity and IPV appear to differentially impact mental and physical health over time; and ethnicity and IPV appear to interact, disproportionately decreasing mental health in women of color. These findings suggest the need to move beyond ethnic categorizations and move toward a comprehensive understanding of how sociodemographic background, other trauma and IPV interact to decrease health in women. Clinical implications and areas of future study are discussed. Overall, IPV should be considered a clear and present danger to women's mental and physical health over time; and is related to a consistent and chronic burden that impacts their mind, body and spirit. This phenomenon, gone unaddressed, will continue to plague future generations of men, women and children worldwide.

Past studies have focused on the impact of socioeconomic stress (SES) on health in adolescents using individual measures of SES such as parental income, occupation, and/or education. The impact of school and community variables on cardiovascular risk factors in adolescents has not been well studied. The primary goal of this study was to assess the impact of school socioenvironmental factors on cardiovascular risk factors in a sample of 15,885 multiethnic 10 th graders, consisting primarily of understudied ethnic minority groups from 36 public high schools in Miami-Dade County, using a multi-level modeling approach. Ethnic and gender differences in cardiovascular risk factors and health behaviors were also described. The main finding of this study was that school socioenvironmental factors had an impact on body mass index (BMI) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in adolescents. Multiple indicators of socioenvironmental stress negatively impacted BMI and accounted for a large proportion of the variance in a hierarchical linear regression model. High enrollment of students in limited English proficiency classes impacted SBP, suggesting that low acculturation had a positive effect on SBP. Other important findings were the ethnic and gender differences that emerged in cardiovascular risk factors and health behaviors. Overall, African Americans, Caribbean Blacks, and Black Hispanics had higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors and poorer health behaviors than White non-Hispanics, White Hispanics, and Asians. The results of this study suggest that interventions to improve adolescent health should not only be made at the individual-level, but also in the school. The community and government should be aware of the impact of school environment on adolescent health. Availability of healthy foods, higher quality physical education, reduced class size, and improved school atmosphere are some of the many interventions that could be considered in the school.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Ethnic minorities or those with low socioeconomic status (SES) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality, compared to higher SES Whites. National surveys also indicate that low-income, ethnic minority women have the highest rates of inactivity in the United States. Purpose: This study (the Increasing Motivation for Physical ACTivity or IMPACT study) promoted adoption and maintenance of physical activity (PA) in sedentary, low-income women participating in federally funded job training programs. Methods: The study consisted of 2 months of weekly 1-hr classes, then random assignment to 10 months of either home-based telephone counseling for PA plus information and feedback via mailed newsletters (Phone + Mail Counseling condition) or just the mailed newsletters (Mail Support condition). The IMPACT intervention included behavior change strategies for PA as well as discussions related to motivational readiness for PA change. Participants completed surveys and physiological assessments at baseline after the classes ended (i.e., at 10 weeks) and at 6 and 12 months postbaseline. Seventy-three percent of randomized participants (n = 72) were Latina, with a mean age of 32 +/- 10 years. More than half the women had not completed high school, and 73% had an annual income less than $20,000. Results: After 10 months of a home-based intervention, women in the phone + mail counseling condition had significantly greater increases in estimated total energy expenditure compared to women in the mail support condition (p<.05). Conclusions: Regular PA counseling delivered via the telephone and through the mail appears effective for encouraging regular PA among low-income women transitioning from welfare or job training to the workforce.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study explores how pre-adolescent boys of immigrant and working-class backgrounds stage insults and, as part of this process, mobilize categorizations. Data are drawn from ethnographic research combined with detailed analysis (conversation analysis and membership categorization analysis) of video records from peer interactions in an elementary school in Sweden. It was found that the boys deploy multiple resources (of syntactic and phonetic shapes) provided by the talk of the prior speaker and the turn structure of different activities (i.e. games, ridiculing, gossiping) and transform this talk (shifting emphasis, substituting insult terms and pronouns, recycling arguments, repeating striking parts, code-crossing) to collaboratively stage a counter to insults. A variety of negative characteristics (concerning linguistic, social and economic standards) are invoked and negotiated in the boys' insult talk, which both colludes with and transgresses local norms of conduct and institutional discourses. Overall, this study demonstrates the political character of pre-adolescent children's everyday talk in terms of its orientation towards dominant language ideologies and the place that gender, ethnicity and social class occupy within it.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: Treatment outcome for preschool-age children exposed to marital violence was assessed, comparing the efficacy of Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) with case management plus treatment as usual in the community. Method: Seventy-five multiethnic preschool mother dyads from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds were randomly assigned to (1) CPP or (2) case management plus community referral for individual treatment. CPP consisted of weekly parent-child sessions for 1 year monitored for integrity with the use of a treatment manual and intensive training and supervision. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and participated in the Structured Clinical Interview for DC:0-3 to assess children's emotional and behavioral problems and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Mothers completed the Symptom Checklist-90 and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale interview to assess their general psychiatric and PTSD symptoms. Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated the efficacy of CPP with significant group x time interactions on children's total behavior problems, traumatic stress symptoms, and diagnostic status, and mothers' avoidance symptoms and trends toward significant group x time interactions on mothers' PTSD symptoms and general distress. Conclusions: The findings provide evidence of the efficacy of CPP with this population and highlight the importance of a relationship focus in the treatment of traumatized preschoolers.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Decades following Brown v. Board of Education (1954), issues regarding the effects of skin color, poverty, and racial differences in the availability of protective factors persist. For a multiethnic sample of mainly African American (56%), female (69%), and high-achieving (65%) youths, a dual-axis model of vulnerability is used to compare four groups of youths identified as high, masked, low, and undetermined vulnerability on the basis of the presence of risk and protective factors. Risks included level of poverty, number of parents in home, and skin-color pigmentation. Protective factors included youths' perceptions of school climate, parental monitoring, and consonance between skin pigmentation and preferred skin color. The author suggests that 50 years post-Brown, issues concerning White privilege, color stereotyping, power discrepancies, and economic disparities maintain ""invisible"" and persistent hurdles for vulnerable youths who vary on available protective factors. Findings confirm the impact of vulnerability on psychosocial and achievement outcomes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The increasing diversity of immigrant-receiving countries calls for measures of residential segregation that extend beyond the conventional two-group approach. The authors represent simultaneously the relative social distance occupied by a wide array of ethnic groups. They use census tract tabulations for the Toronto Consolidated Metropolitan Area in 1996 and the technique of multidimensional scaling to summarize the residential neighborhood pattern of the city's largest 50 ethnic groups. From the two-dimensional multidimensional scaling configuration, the authors find that African/Caribbean groups and blacks were highly clustered and shared common patterns of segregation with other groups. This study highlights the value of looking beyond broad racial or panethnic classifications in understanding ethnic congregation and residential segregation patterns. The results also demonstrate the merits of this method in providing a more conceptually meaningful way to understand social distance among groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Theoretically the paper addresses the question of how official and unofficial discourses are related and what function the unofficial register serves for the official one. It draws on the idea of 'underlife' and the heterogeneity of discourse in order to show how the unofficial discourse can be a productive tool for students to both distance themselves from school and negotiate school identities in order to create new, and (for students) more compatible, forms of 'school'. Institutional settings do not automatically produce the institutional scripts, positions and norms they are associated with; rather, they need to be authored by participants who 'instantiate' these scripts, positions and norms. This paper focuses on how students author school (the official) but at the same time produce alternative discourses (the unofficial). A data set of transcribed student group talk in a multiethnic classroom in the Netherlands is used for the analysis.

Authored Book",,"(from the introduction) This manual presents a unique, step-by-step model for treating children who have experienced chronic conflict or violence within their families. The first edition was developed specifically for children of highly conflicted separating and divorced families who were referred by family courts to the Judith Wallerstein Center for the Family in Transition, which has been one of the country's foremost centers for divorce research. The second edition includes changes that have been made to the model during the past seven years as it has been applied more broadly in multiethnic, multicultural neighborhoods, schools, and family agencies to help children who are living in a whole range of stressful situations related to family conflict and violence. Whereas the first edition focused solely on older school-age children, the second edition includes a section specifically designed for younger school-age children as well. Now the manual provides developmentally appropriate treatment curricula for children ranging from about five to fourteen years.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article provides an overview of the current issues and challenges facing the nascent paradigm of minority language rights (MLR). It focuses on the theoretical points of dispute and tension with respect to MLR, as well as the challenges attendant upon their implementation in complex, multiethnic and multilingual contexts. The article acknowledges, but also responds to, key critiques of MLR to date. These include debates about linguistic modernisation, linguistic identities and essentialism, language and social mobility, and macro and micro language practices. In light of these debates, the article speculates about possible ways forward for the MLR paradigm.

We examined the multiethnic population in northern Norway where social inequalities between the Sami and the non-Sami population are not prominent. Clients (N = 347) and therapists (N = 32) in outpatient treatments reported demographics, ethnicity and the therapeutic alliance. Clients also reported pretreatment psychosocial status, service utilization and the type of help requested. Therapist recorded clinical and diagnostic assessments and treatment plans. The Sami and non-Sami client groups were similar in demographics and pretreatment psychosocial characteristics. However, the therapists prescribed more sessions and more socially focused interventions when clients were Sami. Verbal therapy was more often used by the non-Sami therapists. Alliance ratings were positively correlated only between Sami therapists and their clients, and Sami therapists rated the largest initial clinical improvement. Clinics located in the high Sami density areas offered their clients more therapy sessions, than in clinics in the high non-Sami density areas. Ethnic similarity between client and therapist were associated with more frequent use of medication and less frequent use of verbal therapy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The sociological study of the mental health of racial-ethnic minorities depends on the measurement quality of the instruments used to evaluate mental health. A commonly used instrument in research on mental health disparities, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), has not been thoroughly validated for use in the multiethnic and foreign-born populations currently living in the U.S. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this analysis provides the first multiethnic evaluation and psychometric analysis of the CES-D by acculturation level among youth ages 12-20. Correcting for the measurement problems contained in the CES-D improves the ability to detect differences in depression across ethnocultural groups, and to identify relationships between depression and other outcomes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: To evaluate any association between obesity in middle age, measured by body mass index and skinfold thickness, and risk of dementia later in life. Design: Analysis of prospective data from a multiethnic population based cohort. Setting: Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Group, a healthcare delivery organisation. Participants: 10 276 men and women who underwent detailed health evaluations from 1964 to 1973 when they were aged 40-45 and who were still members of the health plan in 1994. Main outcome measures: Diagnosis of dementia from January 1994 to April 2003. Time to diagnosis was analysed with Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, race, education, smoking, alcohol use, marital status, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, stroke, and ischaemic heart disease. Results: Dementia was diagnosed in 713 (6.9%) participants. Obese people (body mass index > 30) had a 74% increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 2.26), while overweight people (body mass index 25.0-29.9) had a 35% greater risk of dementia (1.35, 1.14 to 1.60) compared with those of normal weight (body mass index 18.6-24.9). Compared with those in the lowest fifth, men and women in the highest fifth of the distribution of subscapular or tricep skinfold thickness had a 72% and 59% greater risk of dementia, respectively (1.72, 1.36 to 2.18, and 1.59, 1.24 to 2.04). Conclusions: Obesity in middle age increases the risk of future dementia independently of comorbid conditions. An amendment to this article reports that: This is version 2 of the paper. In this version, in the results section of the abstract the comparison is between men and women in the highest fifth (not the higher fifth) and the risk of dementia in men and women in the highest fifth of tricep skinfold thickness is 59% greater (not 60%), in table 1 the footnote says that data on education were missing for 1185 (not 185), and the adjusted hazard ratio for obese men is 1.30 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.87 (not 1.20) in table 3 and the third paragraph of results.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Recent systematic reviews of measurement strategies have identified a striking lack of data to support the validity of most questionnaires used with multiethnic, migrant populations. In the context of two ongoing research studies examining the reproductive health needs of migrant women in Canada, cultural validation was required for proposed study questionnaires and protocols in a total of 13 languages. Multilingual, multiethnic women with various migrant profiles were recruited from the community to review research materials in a series of focus groups. Recommendations by these women were made in relation to consent and interpretation procedures, development of trust in research, home visits after birth, approaches to sensitive topics, inclusion of discrimination as a research variable, and reimbursement of participants. Preliminary work applying focus-group methods to mixed ethno-cultural groups yielded valuable information on appropriateness of planned research.

We review literature on multiethnic cities by focusing on three important aspects of urban structures and processes: racial and ethnic residential patterns, ethnic businesses, and the performance of racial and ethnic groups in the labor market. Although the literature has identified many factors that shape these urban structures and processes, our discussion specifically focuses on the effects of multigroup contexts on urban structures and processes. We focus and compare four major racial and ethnic groups: whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. Specific ethnic subgroups of all four groups are also discussed.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) According to the author, it is imperative that Mexican-descent youth develop relationships with adults and peers through which they gain access to academic resources and develop and sustain a vision of themselves as college bound. This chapter offers one example of how such relationships can be developed. It focuses on a particular group of Mexican-descent migrant students who forged supportive relationships with adults and with peers through the Migrant Education Program (MEP) and the Migrant Student Association (MSA) at their high school. The field site for the study is Hillside High School (HHS), a large multiethnic public high school located along California's Central Coast. All students in this focal sample graduated from high school on schedule in June 2002, and 85% had plans to enter college the following fall: 25% were headed directly to a 4-year college, 60% expected to enroll in one of California's community colleges, and the remaining 15% intended either to join the military, attend trade school, or work. Considering the many barriers to school success that these young people faced on a daily basis, this obviously is an impressive record.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In this chapter, the author examines the socioecological context of children's play in a traditional community in the Okavango Delta of Botswana, in order to develop a better understanding of the possible influences of play on children's development of adult competence. The mixed subsistence economy of the study community provides the means to identify the common and divergent elements of agrarian and foraging subsistence regimes' influence on children's play. Although only a small proportion of the people in the present study obtain all their nutritional requirements from foraging, all of them obtain substantial portions of their needs from fishing, hunting, and the collection of wild plant sources. No longer nomadic, and with elements of social structure strongly influenced by both economic change and long social interchange with other groups, the people in the study community contribute another dataset of play behavior among foraging people, and, at the same time, advance our knowledge of play in the context of agrarian socioecology. As a multiethnic community of forager/agropastoralists, this group at once illustrates the flexible adaptation of childhood and the joint effects of multiple socioecological contexts on children's time allocation and behavior.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The evolution of psychiatry in Latin America reflects the merger of three different types of human interactions. The first one is represented by the aborigine cultures that prevailed in this Continent before its discovery. This group in primarily represented by the Aztec and Incas Indians who primordially occupied Mexico and Peru respectively. The second one is primarily exemplified by the Spaniards and Portuguese colonizers who discovered and occupied this Continent from 1492 till the second part of the XIX Century. The third one is personified by the forced African migration (slavery) that was initiated by the colonizers and maintained during most part of the colonization period. This ongoing multiethnic and multicultural process has led to what is today Latin America. In this context, the psychiatric ideology that prevailed in Spain and Portugal, primarily in Spain, had an enduring impact across Latin America during the colonization period. Nevertheless, the influence of the aborigine population culture and psychological framework not only helped to build the foundations of this continent but its manifestations still are present in today's Latin America. Given this context, in this article, a historical perspective of psychiatry in Latin America will be delineated, with emphasis on education, research and clinical practice from the pre-discovery period to the present time.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Increased rates of childhood obesity combined with more accessible information about the relationship between diet, physical activity and inactivity, and chronic diseases suggest the need for analyzing the complex process of receiving and transmitting messages related to child feeding practices. This study examined the perceptions of childhood obesity within 1 multiethnic community, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In particular, through the use of focus groups, individuals indicated that sociocultural, familial, and official nutritional messages were most influential to their health care behaviors. The coordinated management of meaning (CMM) theory was used to gain insight into how individuals negotiate competing messages occurring at different levels of meaning. Given its focus on cultural influences (parallel to the concepts of archetypes), CMM proved especially relevant for understanding child feeding beliefs, values, attitudes, and practices in diverse ethnic populations. Implications for future health communication research that might draw from a CMM approach were identified, as well as pragmatic endeavors that focus on the development, implementation, and evaluation of culturally appropriate interventions in the prevention of childhood obesity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Understanding variability in conceptions of dementia in multiethnic populations is important to improve care and guide research. The objectives of this study were to describe caregiver conceptions of dementia using a previously developed typology and to examine the correlates of conceptions of dementia in a multiethnic sample. This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Boston and the San Francisco Bay area. Participants were a convenience sample of 92 family dementia caregivers from four ethnic/racial groups: African-American, Anglo European-American, Asian-American, and Latino. In-depth, qualitative interviews explored the caregivers' ideas about the nature and cause of dementia (i.e., explanatory models). Explanatory models of caregivers were categorized as biomedical, folk, or mixed (folk/biomedical). Quantitative analyses examined the association between ethnicity and other caregiver characteristics, and explanatory model type. Overall, 54% of caregivers, including 41% of Anglo European Americans, held explanatory models that combined folk and biomedical elements (i.e., mixed models). For example, many families attributed Alzheimer's disease and related dementias to psychosocial stress or normal aging. Ethnicity, lower education, and sex were associated with explanatory model type in bivariate analyses. In multiple logistic regression analysis, minority caregivers (P<.02) and those with less formal education (P<.02) were more likely to hold mixed or folk models of dementia. Although minority and nonminority caregivers often incorporated folk models into their understanding of dementia, this was more common in minority caregivers and those with less formal education. Further research on cross-ethnic differences in a larger, more-representative sample is needed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: We examined the efficacy of a cancer prevention intervention designed to improve health behaviors among working-class, multiethnic populations employed in small manufacturing businesses. Methods: Worksites were randomly assigned to an intervention or minimal-intervention control condition. The intervention targeted fruit and vegetable consumption, red meat consumption, multivitamin use, and physical activity. Results: Employees in the intervention group showed greater improvements for every outcome compared with employees in the control group. Differences in improvement were statistically significant for multivitamin use and physical activity. Intervention effects were larger among workers than among managers for fruit and vegetable consumption and for physical activity. Conclusions: The social-context model holds promise for reducing disparities in health behaviors. Further research is needed to improve the effectiveness of the intervention.

Literature on drug use in adolescence suggests that personal vulnerability accounts for most experimental and problem drug use. Included in the vulnerability construct are religiosity, perceived risk, social influence, drug access, social norms, and social risk defined primarily as exposure to various forms of violence. This study shows that personal vulnerability explains only some of the variance in use and predicts variance differently with respect to different specific drugs and polydrug use. Further, it argues that additional contextual factors including social networks, party and club attendance, and drug selling activities, all typical of emerging adulthood and urban lifestyle, are also important factors in enhancing potential for accelerated drug use during this developmental period. Finally, it notes that the consequences of these activities have implications for further economic and social marginalization of urban, multiethnic low income emerging adults.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Performativity is a theory of how reality comes into being. It is also a deconstructive practice. This article addresses the question of performativity as an emergent mode of working in social and cultural research. It does so by way of exploring a research project focusing on prostitution in a multiethnic context in north Norway, carried out by two researchers doing collaborative work on men, sexuality and knowledge. The author's interest is in exploring performativity as a mode of engaging, aimed at achieving transformations in the terms through which the real is constituted. The author argues that practising performativity requires an openness within the research process to the possibility that researchers and their practices themselves must alter. Such transformative modes of relating seem to be called for in order to develop effective ways of engaging with the present.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Editorial,"Due to the increased migration from the sixties in the last century up until now, health care in the ""modern Western world"" is more and more confronted with the consequences of a multiethnic society, especially in Europe. One of the main areas where the consequences are very apparent is in the interaction between the health care provider and the patient. Many researchers argue that ethnic differences between both parties are a potential cause for misunderstanding and lead to a loss of quality of care. Examples of misdiagnosis, lack of patient compliance and differences in treatment yield to arguments for unequal treatment and discussions around discrimination and racism. Based on empirical research in various contexts, the main cause for these consequences of the ethnic confrontation in the doctor's office lies in differences in a whole set of values, norms, attitudes and expectations of the patient and the doctor before they meet each other. In research on ethnic disparities in health care, we need to focus on the consequences of differences in that set of values, norms, attitudes and expectations, not only at the patient's side but also at the doctor's site. It is the interaction of these sets that should matter in ethnic related health care research, other characteristics like language and socioeconomic status are important but of secondary importance.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: To assess the relationship between social isolation and stroke outcomes in a multiethnic cohort. Methods: As part of the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study, the authors prospectively followed a cohort of patients with stroke for 5 years. Baseline data including social isolation were collected. At follow-up, the authors documented outcome events as defined by the first occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke recurrence, or death. Cox hazard models were used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR, 95% CI) for prestroke predictors of post stroke outcomes. Results: The authors followed 655 ischemic stroke cases for a mean of 5 years. The cohort was 55% women; 17% white, 27% African American, 54% Hispanic; mean age 69 +/- 12 years. There were 265 first outcome events. In univariate analysis, coronary artery disease (OR 1.3, 1.0 to 1.7), age > 70 years (OR 1.9, 1.5 to 2.5), atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR 1.8, 1.3 to 2.5), race-ethnicity (white vs Hispanic) (OR 1.7, 1.1 to 2.9), physical inactivity (OR 1.3, 1.1 to 2.6), help at home (OR 1.8, 1.4 to 2.4), and social isolation (OR 1.4, 1.2 to 1.6) were associated with increased risk of an outcome event. No association was seen for hypertension, diabetes, education, sex, insurance, occupation, marital status, or primary care physician. In the multivariable model controlling for age, AF (OR 1.9, 1.5 to 2.5), help at home (OR 1.5, 1.1 to 2.0), and social isolation (OR 1.4, 1.1 to 1.8) predicted outcome events. Conclusion: Prestroke social isolation is a predictor of outcome events post stroke. Lack of social support may contribute to poorer outcomes due to poor compliance, depression, and stress.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Prior research has provided conflicting evidence about the association between partner awareness of an HIV-seropositive person's serostatus and HIV transmission behavior via unprotected intercourse. The current study examined partner awareness of participant HIV-seropositive status and sexual behavior in a multiethnic sample of HIV-seropositive men who have sex with men. Most HIV-seropositive men reported that their primary partners are aware, and most reported that at least some non-primary partners are aware the participant was HIV-seropositive before first having sex. Partner awareness of participant HIV-serostatus was related to unprotected sexual behavior during the past 3 months in a non-linear fashion, as men with partners who were inconsistently aware had higher rates of unprotected receptive anal intercourse than men with partners who were consistently aware or consistently unaware. Men with partners who were inconsistently aware also had higher rates of insertive oral intercourse than men with partners who were consistently aware. However, there were no differences in HIV transmission risk behavior between men with partners who were consistently aware and men with partners who were consistently unaware a participant was HIV-seropositive.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"With the recognition of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as an important outcome in the course of HIV-disease, it is important to gain a better understanding of the complex relationships among the various factors that influence it. This study assesses a conceptual framework of HRQOL, consisting of disease status, socio-economic status (SES), behavioral variables, symptom status, role-specific functional status and HRQOL, among a multiethnic, economically disadvantaged population of individuals living with HIV/ AIDS. Self-report data were collected from 348 patients receiving care at a large HIV/AIDS care center, serving residents of a large metropolitan area. The relationships between the study variables were examined using structural equation modeling. Results indicated that the hypothesized framework provided a well-fitted solution to the data, chi2(44df) = 57.62], p = 0.08 and root mean square error of approximation = 0.03, 90% confidence interval 0.01; 0.05. This framework suggests that health-related variables fall along a continuum, beginning with disease status and ending in generic HRQOL. In addition, the framework suggests that behavioral factors (i.e., smoking status, alcohol consumption, and illicit drug use) and SES exert significant effects along this continuum and should be carefully considered when analyzing and interpreting HRQOL data.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Drawing on socio-cultural theory, we understand the norms regulating the practices within the mathematics classroom as resulting from the social representations of the socially dominant groups and of the school culture related to what constitutes learning mathematics. Immigrant students, having their own personal histories as members of particular social groups, and having been in school traditions other than the one predominant in the host society, have their own images of what mathematics in school is about. Individuals interacting in the classroom are all re-interpreting the different episodes from the perspective of the social representations of the larger groups with which they identify themselves. In multiethnic classrooms different re-interpretations of the same norms clash. The lack of negotiation gives rise to obstacles to immigrant students' participation in the mathematical conversations and, therefore, interferes with the students' learning process.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article explores the ways in which parents use their own past experiences as a mediational tool for understanding their child's current school learning. Following a sociocultural approach parents' past experiences were examined drawing on the notions of (1) heterochronicity, which looks at the partially overlapping histories of the individual and society and (2) prolepsis whereby the imagined future mediates and constrains the world of the present. The analysis draws on 22 interviews with parents whose children were from three primary multiethnic schools in a town in the Southeast of England. The findings brought to light the means by which parents can either intentionally or unintentionally use the past to inform their current representations and practices. Thus at times they use their past experiences to mediate internalisation (reproduction of the experience), at other times they use them to promote externalisation (change brought about by the experience). It is within this process that parents projected a future ideal for their child, which was either congruent or discordant with their own past.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article explores the mediational role of classroom discourse in the development of shared understanding in the multiethnic classroom. Successful participation in classroom discourse not only requires linguistic and cognitive competence, but also demands cultural knowledge, which often is taken for granted. Research carried out in a multiethnic third grade class in Norway reveals that a discrepancy between teachers' implicit assumptions of what is ""common knowledge"" and minority pupils' lack of background knowledge might impede joint meaning construction. Discourse episodes, illustrating various misunderstandings, are analyzed and compared. The analysis of the discourse focuses on how the topical content, the multiple reference frames applied, and the particular forms of discourse used, jointly create the framework within which development of shared understanding occurs or fails to occur. It becomes apparent that various discourse patterns, creating different premises for pupil participation, afford different ways of dealing with the misunderstandings encountered. It is argued that disparities in understanding should not be looked upon as ""transmission errors"", that are something to be avoided in classroom dialogue, but might be viewed as generators of new understandings. The article is based on qualitative analysis of discourse excerpts, using transcribed audio recordings, field notes and interviews.

The diversity of cultural backgrounds of students and parents leads to new transitions, enables new forms of participation, and demands the creation of new concepts, values and practices. Processes of mediation have a vital place in the required developments. The contributions to this issue study the relationship between learning and social mediation on three levels: (1) the mediating role of cultural tools, in particular language and the curriculum, (2) the role of peers and teachers in the appropriation of cultural tools by minority students, and (3) the mediating role of social representations in the shaping of students' identities at school.

The context of Italian mental health counseling is complex and full of new and old premises, events, and arguments. On the one side, the way counseling has developed and is perceived in Italy results from the intersection of old cultural legacies, such as Christianity, and new challenges, such as a multicultural and multiethnic society. On the other side, the development of mental health counseling in Italy is the result of the encounter between the pragmatic, optimist U.S. counseling and the phenomenological, hermeneutic traditions of European schools. The article ends with an exploration of the potentials that may arise from an ongoing communication between U.S. and Italian mental health professionals.

Specifically, the article compares Latinos relative to non-Latino Blacks and non-Latino Whites. Controlling for the effects of other victim, offender, and incident characteristics, logistic and multinomial logistic regression analyses indicate that firearm use has large and similar effects on event lethality for Latino and non-Latino Black offenders but no significant effect for non-Latino Whites. However, Latino, Black, and White attackers are equally likely to use a gun in violent encounters. The authors discuss the implications of these ethnic patterns in terms of prevailing conceptions of firearm violence.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Study objective: To investigate cultural identity as a risk factor for mental health problems among adolescents. Design: A cross sectional school based population survey. Mental health problems were measured using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire. Pupils were classified into one of four cultural identity types on the basis of friendship and clothing choices. Setting: East London. Participants: 2623 adolescents (aged 11-14) from a representative sample of 28 schools in east London. Results: In comparison with marginalised adolescents who chose friends from neither their own or other cultures, fewer mental health problems were found among adolescents making culturally integrated friendship choices (friends from own and other cultures: OR=0.6, 0.4 to 0.9), boys making integrated friendship choices (OR = 0.45, 0.22 to 0.91), and specifically among Bangladeshi pupils with integrated friendship choices (OR=0.15, 0.04 to 0.55). Conclusion: As measures of cultural identity, integrated friendship choices overall, and specifically for boys and Bangladeshi pupils, are associated with lower levels of adolescent mental health problems.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In North America's large multiethnic cities, the percentage of foreign-born children is constantly rising. The drama workshop program described here was designed to facilitate the adjustment of newly arrived teens. The program was developed gradually over a period of 3 years by the Transcultural Psychiatry Team at the Montreal Children's Hospital, in partnership with the creative arts therapies program at Concordia University and the French-language St. Luc High School in Notre Dame de Grace, a multiethnic district in Montreal with a high proportion of recently arrived immigrants and refugees. The aim of the program is to make it easier for adolescents to adjust to their new environment through creative group work involving identity issues related to being migrants and members of cultural minorities. On the whole, the teachers appreciated the drama therapy program, which helped them get to know their students better. A number of questions remain unanswered, however. In the medium term, how much do the workshops influence the well-being and adjustment of the teens to their new environment? How can schools realistically incorporate a type of therapy that requires a fairly large team, while at the same time maintaining its specificity? Further research on these issues is necessary before drama workshops can become a tool that lends itself easily to use by multiethnic schools.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The purpose of this study was to explore the phenomenon of dementia caregiving in an ethnically diverse group of Latino caregivers, with the goal of identifying cultural influences on the caregiving experience. This qualitative, descriptive, cross-sectional study used Leininger's ethnonursing approach. There were more similarities than differences in this multiethnic sample of Latino caregivers in understanding of dementia symptoms, beliefs about the caregiving role, and in the factors affecting ongoing care. A lack of knowledge about dementia, rather than culturally influenced beliefs, was the major deterrent to recognition of initial symptoms. Participants viewed family-centered home care as a culturally embedded value but were willing to consider placement when home care became impractical. Providers need to understand the ways in which caregivers must negotiate the tension between cultural beliefs and the demands of their individual circumstances.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article compares different discourses of civic responsibility for Korean American evangelicals in a second-generation Korean congregation and a multiethnic congregation located in the same impoverished ethnic minority community. Those in the second-generation church define civic responsibility through difference from immigrant Koreans. They stress caring for members of their local community and explicitly reject their parents' connection of Christianity to economic mobility. Yet, they find relating to other minorities in their local community difficult because of an implicit belief that the economically impoverished are not hardworking. Korean Americans in the multiethnic church connect Christianity to valuing diversity. A religious individualism that is used to justify diversity also helps Korean Americans stress their commonality with other ethnic minorities and legitimates commitment to community service. These results help researchers rethink how new groups of Americans might influence the relationship of evangelical Christianity to American civic life.

Such reforms allow an unprecedented degree of flexibility, but little is known about their implementation. Researchers administered the Local Agency Survey to the first national probability sample of public child welfare agencies from 1999 to 2000. Findings indicate that ASFA has had the most effect on child welfare service delivery. Welfare reform has had less effect, and MEPA-IEP seems to have had little effect at all.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper examines the ways in which British Chinese pupils are positioned and represented within the popular/dominant discourse of teachers working in London schools. Drawing on individual interviews from a study conducted with 30 teachers, 80 British Chinese pupils and 30 Chinese parents, we explore some of the racialised, gendered and classed assumptions upon which dominant discourses around British Chinese boys and girls are based. Consideration is given, for example, to teachers' dichotomous constructions of British Chinese masculinity, in which British Chinese boys were regarded as 'naturally' 'good' and 'not laddish', compared with a minority of 'bad' British Chinese boys, whose laddishness was attributed to membership of a multiethnic peer group. We also explore teachers' constructions of British Chinese femininity, which centred around remarkably homogenised representations of British Chinese girls as 'passive' and quiet, 'repressed', hard-working pupils. The paper discusses a range of alternative readings that challenge popular monolithic and homogenising accounts of British Chinese masculinity and femininity in order to open up more critical ways of representing and engaging with British Chinese educational 'achievement'.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article examines how Korean Americans use the cultural resources of religious communities to mediate race, ethnic, and socio-economic boundaries that have consequences for civic life. Specifically, I compare involvement of Korean Americans in second-generation Korean congregations to those in multiethnic churches. I find Korean Americans who participate in second-generation Korean churches use religion to largely reproduce images of Korean Americans as model minorities, and implicitly distance themselves from those whom they perceive as less financially successful. In contrast, Korean Americans in multiethnic congregations use religion to emphasize the commonality Korean Americans have with other minorities. By using a cultural framework that allows for the agency of individuals in identity and group boundary construction, this work more generally shows the potential for new Americans to use the cultural resources of local organizations to change existing ethnic and racial boundaries in the United States.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) This text it addresses the individual counseling process with children and adolescents who exhibit more normal developmental problems or typical problems in their age group, rather than serious problems such as addictive behaviors, eating disorders, self mutilation, or severe depression, which have been the focus of numerous publications. It also summarizes information on developmental theory and combines it with a practical approach to both assessment and intervention with school-age clients. In addition, this book provides helping professionals with strategies for increasing their own cultural competence and applying this in their work with youngsters. The cultural emphasis distinguishes this book from the original book, Developmental Assessment and Intervention With Children and Adolescents that I (Ann Vernon) wrote 10 years ago, and I am pleased that my colleague Dr. Roberto Clemente was able to contribute his expertise in this particular area to this work. Assessment and Intervention With Children and Adolescents: Developmental and Multicultural Approaches is intended for school and mental health counselors, social workers, and school psychologists who counsel children and adolescents and who want a very practical resource to help them determine what the problem is, how it fits with the normal developmental sequence, how culture affects the experiences of young multiethnic clients, and how to address these issues. It is also a book that helps graduate students learn to combine theory with practice. By reading this book, practitioners can learn how to help school-age clients and significant others deal more effectively with the challenges of growing up. It is our hope that this book can provide readers with practical information and user-friendly techniques to enhance their skills and give them new ideas in working with children and adolescents.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) How can we develop the values of tolerance and recognition? And how can we develop an understanding of the roots of ethnic conflicts and different cultures? Any Russian educator--as well as the education system in general--faces these questions today. In this chapter I will discuss how this problem is approached in civic and social studies education in Russia. Before moving to the discussion of specific curriculum and education policy, I will give a context for this policy by describing the state of affairs in ethnic relations in modern Russia and the general development of civic education. For the analysis of educational policy and practice, we will use a framework similar to the framework used in the research on policies for education for democratic citizenship and management of diversity in southeastern Europe that was conducted by the Council of Europe (Education for Democratic Citizenship, 2002). In this research two central questions were asked: (1) What policies did a government develop? (2) What measures have been adopted to implement policies that will make this rhetoric real? Special emphasis will be given to textbook analysis. Textbooks on social studies and history will be analyzed. We will also consider the development and implementation of regional policy (large multiethnic cities, ethnic regions, and Chechnya).

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Britain is a ""mature democracy"" which prides itself on its parliamentary form of government developed over centuries and on its deep-rooted civil and political liberties. It has also long been a diverse society, although it has only recognized itself as a multicultural nation since the second half of the 20th century, following substantial Black and Asia immigration. ""Britain"" refers loosely to the United Kingdom (UK) of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Great Britain consisting of England, Scotland, and Wales. This chapter focuses on citizenship and citizenship education for this diverse, multiethnic, democratic Britain. The chapter will consider key notions and the development of citizenship and policies on citizenship and citizenship education, especially in England, the largest and most ethnically diverse region in Britain. The recently introduced citizenship education in England will be critically examined, and some broad implications for practice indicated.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Although many cancer survivors address cancer-related concerns through contact with fellow patients in support groups, few reports have focused on the experience of Asians and Pacific Islanders. This report summarizes the results of semistructured interviews with 24 participants in a well-established prostate cancer support group in Hilo, Hawaii, 17 of whom were of Asian or Pacific Islander ancestry. According to the men, the benefits of group participation include camaraderie, information, improved coping ability, and ability to discuss medical experiences. The group's success was attributed to its peer leadership, participation of peer-professionals, and members' widespread participation in a variety of activities. The group contributed to the larger community by organizing specific events for family members, interacting outside the meetings, and tailoring group activities to reflect multicultural preferences for communication. The experiences of the Hilo group contrast with the experiences of other support groups reported in the literature. Although information seeking in the group was important, emotional and social support was at least as significant, and use of humor and discussions of negative experiences regarding medical care were common. The group's distinctive features may stem from the values and norms of its close-knit, multiethnic, predominantly Asian and Pacific Islander small-town community. The findings imply that for prostate cancer support groups, one ""size"" does not fit all men and communities and that tailoring support groups to the intended participants is crucially important.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The Adoption and Safe Families Act gave incentives to states to promote adoption in an environment in which routine racial matching in adoptive placement was forbidden under the Multiethnic Placement Act/Interethnic Adoption Provisions. Adoptions of many kinds increased after the passage of ASFA. Did transracial adoptive placements also increase under ASFA? Using the public use files of the Adoption and Foster Care Reporting System for fiscal years 1995 through 2001, we calculate the percent of adoptions with state involvement that were transracial. At the national level, there is no evidence of an increase in transracial adoptions after ASFA, but in a group of six states transracial adoption has clearly increased since ASFA.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study explored how members of competing host communities may endorse different acculturation orientations towards valued and devalued immigrants settled in the bilingual city of Montreal. Francophone (N = 422) and Anglophone (N = 401) host community students from low-, medium- and high-ethnic diversity colleges completed the host community acculturation scale (HCAS) along with a questionnaire monitoring a range of social psychological correlates of acculturation orientations. Results showed that Anglophones were more integrationist and individualist and less assimilationist than Francophones. Both Francophones and Anglophones were more integrationist and individualist and less assimilationist, segregationist and exclusionist toward valued than devalued immigrants. Attending a multiethnic college had no influence on respondents' acculturation orientations. The more welcoming acculturation orientations of Anglophones compared to Francophones was corroborated by results obtained with immigrants attending the French and the English colleges. Social psychological profiles of the respective acculturation orientations were similar across both host communities thus supporting the construct validity of the HCAS. Attitude toward co-national outgroup was a significant determinant of each acculturation orientations, suggesting that intergroup relations between rival host communities has an impact on acculturation orientations toward immigrants.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) One of the most important things that sets the United States apart from other nations in the post-Cold War era is its unique success as a multiethnic society. In Eastern Europe and the developing world, ancient ethnic hatreds repeatedly dissolve into bloodshed. Even our democratic allies in Western Europe are roiled by ethnic conflict as their immigrant populations grow. Against this backdrop, we can appreciate how remarkable it is that the United States has forged one of the world's most unified and prosperous societies from a blend of peoples differing sharply in national ancestry, language, race and religion. But Americans should not take this tranquility for granted. The most important lesson we can learn from the social and political instability of other nations today, and especially from the scourge of terrorism spanning the globe, is that the institutional foundations of ethnic harmony are fragile and need to be continuously nurtured and reaffirmed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Understanding of risk views in multiethnic societies and in a globalizing world may be enhanced by use of measures of ethnic identity and acculturation. Ethnic identity includes such attributes as positive attitudes about one's ethnic group and a sense of belonging to it, voluntary and frequent association with other ethnic group members, and ethnic practices (preferred music, food, language; attendance at ethnic festivities). Acculturation is absorption of the ""host"" society's cultural norms, beliefs, attitudes and behavior patterns by immigrants, or by other groups historically excluded from the larger society. Both generic and ethnicity-specific measures of these concepts are available in the literature. This Perspective reviews the literature on risk implications of these concepts, how the nature of these measures presents both opportunities and challenges to risk researchers, and the degree to which ethnic identity and acculturation may be correlated with sociodemographic factors. Conceptual and methodological suggestions are made for risk research using these concepts, and hypotheses are offered about what such research might find.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Childhood sexual abuse and related life traumas, and other psychosocial variables were investigated as contributors to ethnic differences in sexual risk behaviors among women who differed in HIV-serostatus. A multiethnic sample of 457 HIV-positive and HIV-negative women residing in Los Angeles county was recruited and studied over 2 years as part of the UCLA-Charles R. Drew University Women and Family Project (WFP) study. Comprehensive interviews were administered to participants by ethnically- and linguistically matched interviewers. Data on demographic information, sexual trauma, substance abuse/dependence, psychiatric distress, and sexual history and risk behaviors were collected. The sample for these analyses consisted of 155 African American, 153 European American, and 149 Latina women, and nearly two-thirds of the sample was HIV-seropositive. HIV-positive women were significantly more likely to report more posttraumatic stress, chronic stress, negative health behaviors, drug use, and psychiatric history than HIV-negative women. European American and African American women were more likely to report a history of sexual trauma than Latina women. Finally, Poisson regression analyses revealed that history of trauma, ethnicity, drug and alcohol use, homelessness, and being HIV-positive were associated with greater likelihood of engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors, with history of trauma increasing the likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors by 5.1%. These findings highlight important differences among women as a function of ethnicity and HIV status, and underscore the need for special services for HIV-positive women that address the risk-enhancing effects of substance abuse/dependence, homelessness, and sexual trauma.

When working with non-Western clients, cultural differences are sometimes experienced as obstacles to therapy. However, it is important to note that many features of Asian culture and lifestyle can be protective and unique solutions can be derived from the individual or family's culture and context. This article hopes to add to the existing literature through a discussion of how systemic therapy is amenable to the Singaporean context and how specific cultural features of the Singaporean Chinese, while presenting at times as obstacles to therapy, can also be seen as potential strengths and employed as resources when working with these families.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) A brief overview of mental health needs and services for vulnerable young people clearly illustrates that, in terms of issues of psychological well-being, looked-after children, homeless youth and young offenders have similar mental health needs. Further, a proportion of vulnerable youth will at one time or another fit into more than one of these categories; for example, they are likely to be both homeless and offending, or both offending and looked-after, at any given time. Consequently an integrated team, providing seamless services to these groups and supportive interaction between team members, is an effective way of meeting their mental health needs. Otherwise, there is fragmentation of limited resources, non-cost-effective service provision and lack of continuity of care, resulting in further disengagement of young people and, their carers. Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland has a general population of 900,000, living in multiethnic inner-city, semi-urban and rural areas. One-quarter of the population, i.e. about 22 5,000 individuals, are under 18 years. A joint child and adolescent mental health strategy involves partnership between one health authority, three local authorities and the voluntary sector. There are two Youth Offending Teams (YOTs), one for the city with approximately 2000 annual referrals, and one for the county (semi-urban and rural) with 1000 annual referrals. Between 800 and 1000 children are looked-after by the three local authorities each year, while a similar number are statutorily classified as homeless at some point during the same period. The child and adolescent mental health service, in partnership with social services, the YOTs, and the Housing Department, has developed an innovative mental health service for young people. In this chapter, we describe the reasoning behind the development of this designated team and its structure. To complement this book's focus on the prevention of mental health difficulties, we concentrate on the team's role in primary level mental health intervention and mental health promotion. For this reason, there will be limited reference to specialist interventions with children and young people.

In this study, differences in maternal evaluations of the same neighborhood were evident in semi-structured qualitative interviews. Few studies have investigated what specific factors contribute to mothers' overall neighborhood assessments. This study investigates how different contextual factors-social interaction, fear of crime, neighborhood appearance, and community violence-are associated with maternal evaluations of their neighborhoods. I then examine the impact of mothers' subjective neighborhood evaluations on maternal mental health and parenting behavior. The sample consisted of 104 mothers representing an impoverished multiethnic group, with 52% reporting an annual personal income under $10,000. Mothers and children resided in an economically disadvantaged, high-risk neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. Using mothers' qualitative interview responses, their overall neighborhood evaluations were categorized into four groups: (1) consistently negative, (2) consistently positive, (3) inconsistent (e.g. describing the neighborhood as a positive place to raise children and then describing many serious neighborhood dangers), and (4) both positive and negative. Multivariate Analysis of Variance revealed that mothers' ratings of neighborhood incivility (e.g. offensive neighborhood appearances) had the greatest affect on subjective neighborhood perceptions, followed by mothers' fear of crime, and their own experiences of personal victimization. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to investigate the relation of specific neighborhood characteristics on mothers' psychological well-being and parenting. Neighborhood factors are related to the psychological health of mothers which, in turn, predicted children's psychological functioning. In sum, this dissertation highlights the important interplay of various contextual factors on mothers' overall neighborhood assessment, mental health, and parenting.

Research on ethnic identity reveals that for members of ethnic minority groups, developing a secure ethnic identity has been found to increase their feelings of self-esteem and heighten their self-awareness while lowering their feelings of anxiety and inferiority (Phinney & Alipuria, 1996). The problem is that the literature tends to focus on the experiences of monoethnic individuals while ignoring the experiences of multiethnic individuals. Multiethnic identity theorists assert that the ethnic identity development process is more complicated for people from multiple ethnic backgrounds (Root, 1996). As a result, it may not be appropriate to generalize findings from studies conducted on monoethnic individuals to the experiences of multiethnic individuals. The purpose of this study is to examine the ethnic identity development of multiethnic individuals. Research on multiethnic identity development communicates the importance of examining the various factors in each person's life that contribute to his or her ethnic identity development instead of just focusing on ethnic identity development as a linear process (Root, 1998). In building on past research, I specifically focused on the research question: What, if any, is the impact of family dynamics on multiethnic identity development? To accomplish this goal, I recruited 100 multiethnic individuals who were required to complete four brief questionnaires measuring ethnic identity, ethnic socialization, family dynamics, and self-esteem. The results revealed that there was a significant relationship between family dynamics and ethnic identity for the participants. There was also a significant relationship between ethnic socialization and ethnic identity for the participants who had one parent who was from a dominant ethnic background and one parent who was from a minority ethnic background. In addition, a significant relationship was found between ethnic identity and self-esteem. Finally, there was a significant relationship between both of the family variables-ethnic socialization and family dynamics-and self-esteem for the participants.

At the same time, highly acculturated Latino adolescents are also more likely to possess an internal HLOC orientation, a variable that has been positively associated with participation in health promoting behaviors. Health value (HV) was explored as a variable to help explain this discrepancy. An additional objective of this study was to better understand the relationships between Internal HLOC, HV and general and behavior-specific self-efficacy as protective factors that are associated with both general and specific health behaviors among a multiethnic and Latino sample of adolescents. Four hundred and seventy-seven ethnically diverse adolescents between the ages of 13-18 from local Bay Area high schools voluntarily participated in this investigation. This study also contained a sub-sample of 124 Latino adolescents. Results supported the role of health value as a protective factor in reducing the risk of engaging in health risk behavior for both the multiethnic and Latino adolescent samples. Internal HLOC appeared to be related to health risk behavior when measured in conjunction with HV for the Latino sub-sample, but not for the multiethnic sample. Surprisingly, both general perceived and behavior-specific self-efficacy appeared to be risk factors for engaging in health risk behavior for both samples; however, this finding may be attributed to methodological considerations regarding the measurement of self-efficacy. Finally, high HV did not account for the discrepancy between high acculturation status and internal HLOC using a global index of health behavior. However, when behavior-specific self-efficacy was substituted for HLOC, using a specific health behavior (sexual health behavior) as the dependent variable, high HV did account for the discrepancy. Findings from this study have implications for designing health-risk preventative interventions for adolescents. Furthermore, findings from this study point to the importance of considering self-efficacy when using HLOC and HV in the prediction of health risk behavior.

The prevalence, etiology, and developmental patterns associated with girls' body image concerns are well documented. However, little research has examined body satisfaction among multiethnic samples of preadolescent boys. The current study examined intra-individual and sociocultural influences on 81 Mexican American and non-Latino white boys' body discrepancy, body satisfaction, and self-concept related to physical appearance. Intra-individual influences included assessments of boys' body mass index, Tanner growth ratings, the Petersen Pubertal Development Scale, and Harter's Perceived Competence Scale for Children. Sociocultural influences included parental body discrepancy assessed using the Contour Drawing Rating Scale, socioeconomic status, and acculturation. Boys' body discrepancy, body satisfaction, and physical self-concept were the outcome constructs assessed. Preadolescents were interviewed when they were in 4th (mean age = 9.91) and 5th grade (mean age = 10.89). Relations among boys' intra-individual influences, sociocultural influences, and body image were assessed with correlational and simultaneous regression analyses when boys were in 4th and 5th grade. Results suggest that boys' body discrepancy varies as a function of their weight status. Further, results paralleled prior research with females indicating that boys' body discrepancy is influenced by their BMI. Results also suggested that fathers may be important socializing agents for their sons' body discrepancy. Finally, results revealed that Mexican American boys experience higher levels of physical self-concept than their non-Latino white counterparts. Theoretically, these findings extend our current understanding of the prevalence and patterns associated with the development of boys' body image and self-concept by illuminating the importance of including Mexican American boys and fathers in eating-related research. From an applied perspective, these findings have important implications for prevention and intervention efforts aimed at promoting youths' body satisfaction, health and well being.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article examines different experiences of immigrant parents and their children in transit between the parents' ethnic world and American culture through three clinical cases: a 16-year-old male, whose mother is Persian and father East Indian and who presents with depression and lack of focus; an 18-year-old girl, whose mother is Nigerian and father African American and who was reporting depressive symptoms and confusion about sexual identity; and an 18-year-old depressed male from an Assyrian Iraqi background whose parents both are from Northern Iraq, but have lived in the United States for 20 years. Adolescents of immigrant families have much more complicated tasks during this phase of their development to establish a future sense of self-identity. A well-consolidated sense of self-identity is more complicated for these types of multiethnic immigrant families. The adolescents must rely on parental ego functions and their coherent sense of identity to weather this stage of their turbulent experience. The cases suggest that both positive and negative aspects of ethnic identification become diluted during adolescence, when identification with parental mores occurs.

This analysis examines segregation in the multi-ethnic context over the 1980-2000 period by using the multi-race information theory index (H), which simultaneously takes the presence of many groups into account, and by also looking at the segregation of each group separately. Results indicate that segregation has been decreasing, mainly due to declines in African American segregation and White segregation with little change or slight increases in Asian and Hispanic segregation. Growing diversity was associated with increases in overall segregation, White segregation, Hispanic segregation, and Asian segregation, though strongly associated with declines in Black segregation. For Hispanics and Asians, it was the growth in Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islander populations, respectively, that were associated with increases in segregation, suggesting that this population growth likely buttressed ethnic enclaves.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study investigated whether group identity as pertaining to an ascribed identity (ethnicity) is a multidimensional construct and examined the relationship between group identification and inter-group attitudes. Data was gathered from a random sample of one hundred twenty six male respondents using a structured questionnaire. Results of factor analysis indicated that group identity was composed of three dimensions (i) affective, (ii) cognitive and (iii) evaluative. The three dimensions were positively correlated to each other indicating that they reflect different facets of a common construct. Inter-group attitudes constrained to two factors: positive attitudes towards out-group and positive attitudes toward in-group. The three dimensions of group identity were positively correlated to positive attitude towards in-group members and a significant negative relationship with positive attitudes towards out-group members was obtained for respectively the evaluative and cognitive dimensions. Results were discussed in terms of the viability of group identity as a multidimensional construct within the specific context of a multiethnic society.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Study purpose: Cervical cancer (CCA) remains a health challenge nationally and globally. In the US, more than 12000 women are diagnosed each year with invasive cervical cancer and more than 220000 are living with a history of this diagnosis (ACS, 2003). This qualitative study aims to examine health related quality of life (HRQOL) from a culturally consistent framework. Methods: Key-informant interviews (N=23) and focus group interviews (N=51) were conducted with a multiethnic sample of cervical cancer survivors (CCS) recruited from hospitals and clinics. Analyses and results: Content and theme analyses were conducted. Findings indicate that cultural and family factors often promote coping and well-being, but may foster delay in care seeking and self-deprecation, particularly among Latina and Asian CCS. Faith in God was relied on for comfort, strength and healing by many survivors, especially the African Americans and Latinas. Overall, our participants reported moderate HRQOL. However, persistent concerns included treatment side-effects; difficulties accessing quality care; inadequate health insurance, barriers to good physician-patient relationship such as language and doctors' time constraints; insufficient knowledge about CCA due to limited information from medical staff; lack of control over treatments; social support, family well-being, functional and work issues; and sexuality and relationship concerns. Socioeconomic status, ethnicity, cultural beliefs and practices, age and family support dictated the level of cancer-related burden. Conclusion: Invasive CCA is primarily a cancer of women who are economically disenfranchised. Women with a CCA diagnosis are disproportionately challenged by lack of resources including quality, affordable health care and psychosocial services. CCS experience persistent medical, psychological, social, and relational concerns. Information concerning CCS is needed, particularly in Spanish, Vietnamese and Korean. There is an urgent need for further research to understand the risk factors, and the social and cultural mediators of cancer-related HRQOL for CCS.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In this study, the author explores what girls learn at menarche from family about acknowledging and accepting positive feelings in relation to their bodies and about making active decisions regarding their bodies and potential sexual practices. The author conducted in-depth individual interviews with 22 African American, European American, and multiethnic girls, aged 14 to 18 years, from both high- and low-income families. She employed an interpretive methodological approach using narrative analysis. The results of this study revealed that girls who were prepared for the physical changes at menarche were better able to acknowledge and accept this bodily change. Also, when girls' wider potentials, such as intellectual or creative capacities, were recognized, they were more likely to describe pleasurable aspects associated with this transition. In contrast, when sex and reproduction were referenced, girls were more likely to associate fear, shame, dysfunction, and victimization with their bodies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: The current study examined the relation of anger, hostility, and severity of depressive symptoms, alone and in combination, to C-reactive protein (CRP) in healthy men and women. Methods: A high sensitivity enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) was used to evaluate CRP levels in a multiethnic sample of 127 healthy, nonsmoking men and women. Fasting blood samples were collected the same day the assessments were done of anger and hostility using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) and depressive symptomatology using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). A psychological risk factor (PRF) score representing a composite summary indicator of BDI and BPAQ-anger and -hostility was generated using principal component analysis. Log-transformed CRP values were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses adjusting for control variables of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), alcohol use, exercise frequency, ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Results: Log-normalized CRP was correlated with BDI (r = 0.21, p = .02) and BPAQ anger (r = 0.20, p = .02), but not with BPAQ hostility. After adjustment for control variables, BDI (beta = 0.05, p = .011), BPAQ anger (beta = 0.05, p = .007), and the PRF composite score (beta = 0.27, p = .005), but not BPAQ hostility (beta = 0.03, p = .11), were significantly associated with log-normalized CRP. Conclusions: Greater anger and severity of depressive symptoms, separately and in combination with hostility, were significantly associated with elevations in CRP in apparently healthy men and women. These associations were independent of potential confounding factors.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We report on an ethnographic consumer research project among Mexican Americans in which negotiation of identity between respondents and a multiethnic, multidisciplinary team structured the process literally and symbolically. This negotiation is examined in terms of research process as well as results. We focus on how knowledge of language and cultural practices (or lack thereof) contributed to interactions and how respondents' articulation of being both Mexican and American is itself a collaborative, social process. Refracting the discussion through personal and disciplinary lenses, we underscore tensions and dynamics arising from an anthropological analytic stance vis-a-vis culture and ethnicity versus corporations' need to simplify. We discuss the implications arising from corporate consumer segmenting practices and question the efficacy of these practices, given normative processes of identity formation. In this case, we also show how constructed authenticity, international market forces, and deterritorialized national ethnicities make it possible for authentic Mexican commodities to emerge from a virtually ""non-Mexican"" part of the United States.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objectives: We examined the associations among early-adolescent substance use, subsequent young-adult substance use disorders, and psychiatric disorders among a community sample of males. Methods: Early-adolescent data were collected in classroom surveys (1990-1993), and young-adult data were collected in face-to-face interviews (1998-2000). Results: We found strong associations between early-adolescent substance use and young-adult substance use disorders and psychiatric disorders. The magnitudes of these associations varied by racial/ethnic group and were strongest among African Americans and foreign-born Hispanics, who reported the lowest early-adolescent substance use. Conclusions: Early-adolescent substance use is most strongly associated with a later pattern of dysfunction among the racial/ethnic groups that reported the lowest levels of early use. The implications of our findings in the context of primary and secondary prevention are discussed.

Methods: We compared heart health knowledge, health behaviors, cardiovascular risk factors, and physical fitness among a group of 442 multiethnic teenaged girls (310 experimental participants vs 132 control participants). Testing was conducted before and after a 12-week program of vigorous exercises integrated with lectures and discussions on diet, exercise, stress, and smoking. Results: Significant differences in body fat, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart health knowledge, and whether breakfast was eaten were observed between experimental participants and control participants. Conclusions: An integrated program of exercise and heart health-related lectures and discussions had a beneficial effect on health knowledge, health behaviors, and onset of risk factors for coronary artery disease among urban girls.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Why do claims about racial hierarchy matter? The question whether some groups are worse off than others is highly pertinent at a time when there is growing recognition of multiple forms of racisms and racial oppression. It is widely accepted that racial hierarchies are still with us today, and this concept is peppered throughout writings on ""race"" and racisms, but, what, exactly, are racial hierarchies, how do racial hierarchies continue to matter, and in what ways do they operate? This special issue, which focuses on the USA and Britain, also addresses the following questions: Does the concept of racial hierarchy aid us in illuminating racial inequalities and the differential experiences of groups in Western multiethnic societies such as the USA and Britain? What sorts of criteria are used in arguments about the place of groups along racial hierarchies? What are the political implications of claims made about racial hierarchies?.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: A randomized trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of a videotape for increasing mammography screening among a multiethnic sample of older women. Methods: A multiethnic sample of Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic women between the ages of 50 and 70 was recruited from Resident Lists compiled by the State of Massachusetts. After completing a baseline questionnaire, women were randomized to receive either a videotape or pamphlet about mammography and recontacted at 2 and 12 months after baseline to assess attitudes, beliefs, and mammography screening. A total of 581 women completed questionnaires at all three time points. Results: At baseline, approximately 75% of women reported having a mammogram in the past year and 90% reported having one in the past 2 years. Rates did not differ between groups. At the 12-month follow-up, mammography rates, adjusted for baseline screening, were 80.4% in the video and 74.8% in the pamphlet group. Logistic regression analysis of mammography at 12 months (within past year vs. >1 year ago) controlling for baseline mammogram produced an odds ratio of 1.48 for the video group that was not significantly different from unity (95% CI = 0.95-2.28). Conclusions: The videotape had a small effect on increasing mammography screening. Although the effect was smaller than more intensive interventions, the video is a convenient, low cost, and easily implemented method to increase mammography screening.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Studies in psychiatric inpatient care for ethnic minority populations indicate a disparity in utilization and diagnosis: African Americans and Native Americans are considerably more likely than Caucasian Americans to be hospitalized; Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans are less likely to be hospitalized. African Americans and Asian Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with the more severe disorder of schizophrenia and less likely to be diagnosed with a less severe mood disorder than are Caucasian Americans. These disparities in utilization are also seen in other Western countries. Specialized units for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Jewish Americans have been developed to deal with these disparities. An outline has been provided for some of the cultural elements of such units from an anthropological perspective: 1) ethnic and cultural identity (complex and dynamic); 2) language; 3) material signs and symbols, events and celebrations, shared values; and 4) views of mental illness that may differ between the patient and the clinician. In this chapter, lessons learned from these special services have been distilled to provide the clinician with practical guidelines in the care of culturally diverse patients in inpatient units. This information is coupled with additional experiences from ordinary inpatient services that are characterized by caring for multiethnic patients in multicultural communities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Based on universal principles, reality therapy is practiced and taught in many cultures and countries. The underlying theoretical basis, choice theory, states that all human beings are motivated by five current genetic instructions: survival or self-preservation, belonging, power or achievement, freedom or independence, fun or enjoyment. The effective reality therapist learns to adapt the methodology to individuals and groups from many cultures. The delivery system employs specific tools for helping clients identify and clarify their wants and desires, their hopes and their dreams. Clients are led to examine specific actions, cognition, and feelings which are seen in reality therapy as behaviors chosen to impact the external world of clients for the purpose of satisfying their needs. The cornerstone in the practice of reality therapy is the self-evaluation by clients. Counselors ask clients to examine the effectiveness of their choices especially as they impact their relationships with people important to them. Clients also examine the attainability of their wants, as well as their degree of commitment in attaining their wants. Included in the process is realistic planning for need satisfaction especially for enhancing the clients' interpersonal relationships. Multiethnic research has shown the multicultural efficacy of reality therapy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: To examine if parental smoking modifies the association between parent-child connectedness and parental disapproval of youth smoking with smoking behavior among minority youth. Methods: Baseline data from an urban Seattle, Washington neighborhood-based intervention trial to reduce risk behaviors among minority males and females aged 11-15 years were used to identify 428 minority youth-parent/guardian pairs. Parental smoking status, assessed by telephone interview, and youth reports of connectedness and parental disapproval, assessed by questionnaire, were tested in Chi-squared stratified analysis and logistic regression to predict youth smoking. Results: The majority (86%) of the parents/guardians were the natural parent of the surveyed child (67% mother; 19% father). Parental mean age was 41 years, 54% reported household incomes less than $30K, and 26% were current smokers. Youth had a mean age of 13 years, 28% self-identified as African-American, 37% as Asian, and 35% as ""Multiethnic""; 41% reported ever smoking, and 9% reported smoking within the past 30 days. Perceived parental disapproval of smoking was not associated with youth smoking behavior. Among youth whose parent did not smoke, those who reported low level of parent-child connectedness were two times more likely to report ever having smoked than those who reported high levels of connectedness. Among youth whose parent smoked, connectedness was not associated with youth smoking. The interaction between connectedness and parental smoking status and its relationship to youth smoking remained significant after controlling for covariates. Conclusion: Overall, high levels of parent-child connectedness are protective against youth smoking. However, family connectedness may not protect children from becoming smokers when parents smoke.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The article considers the contributions of Gee's Discourse theory to the study of multiethnic identity among mixed heritage students. By framing experience within social context, activity, and interaction, I argue that Discourse theory facilitates a conceptualization of ethnic identity as a situated phenomenon emerging at the intersection of the individual and the collective. Drawing on the life histories of a diverse group of mixed heritage students, the article details how Discourse theory provides a particularly powerful lens for exploring the social processes influencing identity development across contexts, such as those related to enculturation within multiple heritage communities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"To characterize the knowledge and attitudes of an ethnically diverse group of inner-city parents regarding childhood immunizations, we conducted structured telephone interviews with 102 primary caretakers at an academic ambulatory pediatric practice during the winter of 2001-2002. The sample was ethnically diverse, with 36% African-American, 41% Hispanic, and 15% white. Half the households had infants or toddlers in the home, and 36% had children with conditions placing them at high risk for influenza. Almost all parents felt that their children should be immunized against diseases in general (98%), but significant proportions also believed that children received more immunizations than necessary (23%), that immunizations could weaken a child's immune system (36%), or that the influenza vaccine could itself make a child ill (48%). Younger parents, those with infants, and parents of children at risk for complications of influenza were less likely to hold these beliefs while race/ethnicity, marital status, parent's education, or socioeconomic status could not be shown to have any effect. We conclude that many inner-city parents question the effects of childhood immunizations and hold erroneous beliefs about them irrespective of age, race, socioeconomic status, or educational background. Practitioners should address these beliefs in efforts to diminish disparities in immunization levels associated with inner-city multiethnic populations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"There is now widely recognized support for classroom-based formative teacher assessment of student performance as a pedagogically desirable approach to assessment which is capable of promoting learning. However, the highly localized and socially co-constructed nature of this type of assessment has raised conceptual and research issues that transcend the theoretical and epistemological concerns of the more established standardized language assessment. One such issue concerns the part played by classroom spoken discourse in the teaching-assessment interaction between teachers and students. This article argues that there is a need to develop theoretically informed research approaches to study how this type of assessment is accomplished through teacher-student discourse in the classroom. Using data collected in two multiethnic and multilingual elementary classrooms we present an analysis, drawing on systemic functional linguistics, to suggest an approach to empirical research and to discuss a number of teaching-learning and research methodological issues.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The effects of membership in ethnic organizations and fraternities and sororities on intergroup attitudes were examined using a 5-wave panel study at a major, multiethnic university. The results showed that these effects were similar for both minority and White students. Membership in ethnic student organizations for minorities and Greek organizations for Whites was anteceded by the degree of one's ethnic identity, and the effects of membership in these groups were similar, although not identical, for both White and minority students. These effects included an increased sense of ethnic victimization and a decreased sense of common identity and social inclusiveness. Consistent with social identity theory, at least a portion of these effects were mediated by social identity among both White and minority students.

Multiple regression analyses indicated that parental support was inversely related to substance use and that peer support was positively related to substance use, as a suppression effect. Structural modeling analyses indicated that effects of support were mediated through pathways involving good self-control, poor self-control, and risk-taking tendency; parent and peer support had different patterns of relations to these mediators. The mediators had pathways to substance use through positive and negative recent events and through peer affiliations. Effects for gender and ethnicity were also noted. Mechanisms of operation for parent and peer support are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article explores the implementation of empowerment zone (EZ) legislation in East Harlem, or what some describe as El Barrio in New York City. The EZ is used as a case study for a critique of tourism as an urban development strategy. El Barrio is difficult to market within a framework of tourism defined by EZ standards, especially the heightened conflicts that ensue as minority communities attempt to reconstitute their cultures for tourist aims. Ultimately, this article shows a growing contradiction between the disavowal of ethnicity and race as grounds for equity and empowerment and the fact that ethnicity and race are the bases on which urban spatial transformations are taking place. Furthermore, the case study suggests that the politicization (and mobilization) of race and ethnicity are not the greatest perils to intra-Latino and interracial alliances in U.S. cities or to people's aspirations regarding urban space at the local level. Rather, the ascendancy of neoliberal tenets presents obstacles to multiethnic and multiracial coalitions on behalf of livable and enjoyable communities for all people.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We examined the effect of varying degrees of obesity on the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its relation to insulin resistance and to C-reactive protein and adiponectin levels in a large, multiethnic, multiracial cohort of children and adolescents. We administered a standard glucose-tolerance test to 439 obese, 31 overweight, and 20 nonobese children and adolescents. Baseline measurements included blood pressure and plasma lipid, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin levels. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increased with the severity of obesity and reached 50 percent in severely obese youngsters. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increased significantly with increasing insulin resistance (P for trend, <0.001) after adjustment for race or ethnic group and the degree of obesity. C-reactive protein levels increased and adiponectin levels decreased with increasing obesity. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is high among obese children and adolescents, and it increases with worsening obesity. Biomarkers of an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes are already present in these youngsters.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined whether promoting washing hands with antibacterial or plain soap decreased diarrhea among children (under 15 yrs old) at the highest risk of death from diarrhea in Karachi squatter settlements. Method used was the Karachi Soap Health Study that evaluated multiethnic households in Bilal, Hazara, Manzoor, and Mujahid, Karachi, in collaboration with Health Oriented Preventive Education, a nongovernmental organization that operates local health clinics and supports community-based health and development. Most residents in these communities have household toilets but the discharge flows into open sewers. After defecation, toilet paper is rarely used. The water used for drinking and handwashing in these communities is heavily contaminated with fecal organisms. Field workers conducted neighborhood meetings about handwashing. They supplied the families with soap as needed. They visited paerticipating households at least weekly and asked the mother or other caregiver if the children had diarrhea. Results show that during 51 weeks of followup, prevalence of diarrhea was lower among younger children (aged 1-5 yrs) vs older children (aged 5-15 yrs).

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In the United States, a multiethnic society with coexistent, variant conceptions of literacy, Puerto Rican individuals are engaged in the creation of cultural identities while becoming literate (Ferdman, 1991). The defining of self--as an individual, as part of a group, and in relation to the cultural image embedded in the literacy program--occurs in the context of the power relationships established with the U.S. society and from its colonial relationship with Puerto Rico. Given the scarcity of information and the complexity of the relationship, I present a profile of literacy among Puerto Rican children. The profile is embedded in a perspective that views literacy as socially constructed and through which cultural values, standards, behaviors, and practices are communicated intergenerationally and renegotiated in social interactions among adults, between adults and children, and among children at play, at home, in school, and in church and other community settings (Perez & Torres-Guzman, 1996). Of particular importance is the group's core values in relation to language. The chapter ends by exploring programs in which literacy has been organized ideologically (Street, 1992) with the dynamism and the complexity of the conditions of Puerto Ricans in the United States in mind. The discussion of these examples serves to highlight the viability of some recommendations made in the educational policy literature on effective ways of educating Puerto Rican and Latino children.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Throughout the past century, assimilation has been the hegemonic theory of ethnic group relations in sociology, and Robert E. Park is generally considered to be the key figure associated with the articulation of assimilation's canonical formulation. Based on a careful reading of Park's main essays on assimilation, this article argues that those who associate his position with the melting pot (with its assumption of the eradication of ethnic traits and ties), the race-relations cycle, or a straight-line process of incorporation misconstrue his views. This article is in part corrective and in part revisionist insofar as it is intended to indicate aspects of Park's theory that have particular relevance to current sociological efforts to understand the implications of assimilation in multiethnic liberal democracies.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the book) ""The What and Why of the Multiethnic Placement Act"" / Joan Heifetz Hollinger / Discusses the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994. Race, color, and national origin issues in making placement decisions are discussed. ""Are You My Mother?"": Conceptualizing Children's Identity Rights in Transracial Adoptions"" / Barbara Bennett Woodhouse / Suggests a fluid conception of identity rights reflecting children's own evolving capacities and developmental concerns as well as their need for family and group ties. ""The Color of Desire: Fulfilling Adoptive Parents' Racial Preferences through Discriminatory State Action"" / R. Richard Banks / Examines harm of facilitative accommodation. ""Private Race Preferences in Family Formation"" / Elizabeth Bartholet / Argues that our public adoption system already drives away many prospective adopters, black and white, by virtue of its negative, restrictive, bureaucratized nature. They flee to the private adoption world where, along with children and birth mothers, they are treated much better. In that private world, many seek to adopt on a same-race basis, but many others adopt across racial lines. Yet others go abroad for international adoption where they typically adopt across a variety of lines of difference-racial, ethnic, religious, and national. ""Racial Geographies"" / Sally Haslanger / Argues that in the contemporary academic context, there is much controversy about the reality of race. Anthony Appiah, for example, argues that race is not real and that we should stop employing racial categories. If race is not real, however, and we follow Appiah's proposal to stop categorizing by race, then it would appear that categorizing adoptions as transracial or same-race would have to go too. And with this would go controversies over whether transracial adoption is good or bad policy. ""Does a Child Have a Right to a Certain Identity?"" / Anita L. Allen-Castellitto / Suggests that the common understanding in most Western societies is that children ought to be brought up in such a way that they will have, not only an identity but a certain identity. ""Intercountry Adoption: A Frontier without Boundaries"" / Joan Heifetz Hollinger / Discusses reasons why US citizens are turning to intercountry adoption. ""Who Are Indian Children within the Scope of the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA)?"" / Joan Heifetz Hollinger / Examines the complex interplay of political, cultural, racial, and constitutional factors that influence the determination of who is an Indian child. ""Pigs in Heaven: A Parable of Native American Adoption under the Indian Child Welfare Act"" / Christine Metteer / Discusses the act that strives to place Native American children within Native American adoptive families. ""Second Parent Adoptions Protect Children with Two Mothers or Two Fathers"" / Joan Heifetz Hollinger / One of the most controversial domains on the frontier of adoption is populated by lesbian and gay couples who are turning to adoption laws to legitimize and protect their status as the parents of the children they are raising. For these couples, adoption is generally a response not to infertility but to their inability to establish legal ties to their children through other means, such as private contracts or marriage. ""State Appeals Court Rulings That Deny or Approve Second Parent Adoptions by Same-Sex Couples"" '(How) Does the Sexual Orientation of Parents Matter?"" / Judith Stacey and Timothy J. Biblarz / Examines 21 studies demonstrating that researchers frequently downplay findings indicating difference regarding children's gender and sexual preferences and behavior that could stimulate important theoretical questions. ""Single Parent Adoptions"" / Nancy E. Dowd / Examines personal, social, and legal issues in single parent adoptions.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In this chapter, we begin with a discussion of the continued widespread usage of celebrity endorsers in advertising. In particular, we discuss the impact of celebrity endorser race, viewer race, and the amount of experience that the viewer has had with those of the same race as the celebrity endorser. We draw particular attention to a psychological phenomenon that plays a pivotal role in recognition of celebrities by ad viewers, namely the ""other-race effect."" We then describe a study we previously conducted to explore facial recognition in general and the other-race- effect phenomenon, without necessarily focusing on celebrity facial recognition. In the concluding section, we link the results of our study on general facial recognition with celebrity facial recognition and provide implications for advertisers who use multiethnic celebrity spokespersons to target majority and minority audiences.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In South Tyrol, a multiethnic Italian province, the authors examined the self-directed negative affect that members of an Italian group experienced after they evaluated members of the German and Albanian groups. The authors examined the affect as a function of out-group derogation. The authors argued that to the extent that out-group derogation may run counter to norms toward intergroup fairness, such normative nonconformity will elicit negative affect directed at the self as a function of perceived intergroup conflict. The findings support the authors' line of reasoning: among Italian South Tyroleans, those who expressed greater out-group derogation were led to experience stronger negative self-directed affect when they rated a low-conflict out-group, but not when they rated a high-conflict out-group, compared to participants whose out-group derogation was less.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"A community sample of 191 families with 4-yr-old children in northern Norway was used to explore whether parenting factors were associated with child behavior problems, and whether these associations differed for boys and girls or for the two main ethnic groups in this region. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used as an instrument. As would be expected from a developmental perspective, elevated scores of child behavior problems were associated with lower levels of parental cuddling and with higher levels of physical punishment. Family demographics such as low maternal age and single parenthood were also associated with more behavioral problems. Girls seemed to be more strongly influenced by child-rearing factors than boys. Subgroup analyses suggested that for harsh treatment, patterns of correlations differed between Sami and Norwegian groups, especially for boys. A positive correlation between physical punishment and externalizing problems emerged for Norwegian boys, but not for Sami boys. Teasing/ridiculing was positively correlated with internalizing problems for Norwegian boys, but inversely correlated for Sami boys. These findings emphasize the importance of taking the child's cultural context and gender into account when assessing behavioral problems in children.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study examined the extent to which a multiethnic sample of 900 Israeli high school students supported date-rape and victim-blaming attitudes and the predictors of such support. Findings indicate wide support for stereotypes justifying sexual coercion by time and the location of the date, the victim's behavior, and the minimization of the seriousness of date rape. A regression analysis indicates that students' gender and age are the strongest predictors of rape-tolerant and victim-blaming attitudes. Socioeconomic status and religious orientation explain a small proportion of the variance in the support of such attitudes. By contrast, no significant relationship is indicated with ethnicity. Alternative sex-education and rape prevention programs must address date-rape and victim-blaming attitudes and make students of both genders aware of various factors that continue to be misread as an invitation to have sex and put them at high risk of experiencing sexual coercion on a date.

After deriving a latent trait-state model of stress, we examined whether or not particular components of stress (i.e., perceived stress, general anxiety, pregnancy-specific anxiety), or stress in general, at specific time points or over time were associated with gestational age. Pregnancy-specific anxiety over the course of pregnancy was associated with shorter gestation after controlling for a number of risk factors, including history of diabetes, smoking, maternal age, and parity. Moreover, these findings suggest that the relation between pregnancy-specific anxiety and gestational age was similar across ethnic groups. The importance of modeling the components and timing of stress with latent variable methodology is discussed.

The measure showed adequate test-retest reliability, and was associated with self-reported health even after controlling for traditional measures of SES. Negative affect did not appear to confound the association between subjective status and health, but may operate as a mediating factor which explains the link between subjective status and health. Future studies on social class disparities in health should consider how subjective perceptions of SES influence health, and explore psychological processes mediating subjective beliefs about status and health outcomes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Previous research has explored the direct association between emotional intelligence (EI) and adolescent smoking, however its relation to psychosocial smoking risk factors has yet to be determined. EI is defined as the ability to: accurately perceive, appraise, and express emotion; access and/or generate feelings in facilitating thought; understand emotion and emotional knowledge; and regulate emotions. EI was assessed with a shortened version of the Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale, Adolescent Version, and was administered to 416 6th graders (53% girls) from middle schools in the Los Angeles area (mean age=11.3 years; 32% Hispanic/Latino, 29% Asian/Pacific Islander, 13% White, 19% Multiethnic, 6% Other). Results indicate that high EI is a protective factor for smoking risk factors in adolescents. Linear regression models revealed that high EI was associated with greater perceptions of the negative social consequences of smoking (P<0.001) and with being more efficacious in refusing cigarette offers (P<0.001). Logistic regression models revealed that high EI was associated with a lower likelihood of intending to smoke in the next year (OR = 0.96, 95% C.I.: 0.92-0.99). Those with high EI may be better able to benefit from social influences-based prevention programs.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Investigates the influence of two potentially protective factors, Health-as-a-Value and spirituality, on monthly alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use in two multiethnic groups of adolescents varying in risk. Three-hundred-eighty-two students from continuation/alternative high school, a population considered at risk for drug use, participated in the study. Similar surveys containing measures of spirituality, ""Health-as-a-Value,"" and monthly substance use, were distributed. Logistic regression analyses were performed. The analyses revealed that spirituality was protective against monthly alcohol use and marijuana use in the lower risk sample. In the higher risk sample, spirituality was protective against all monthly use. ""Health-as-a-Value"" (HAV) was protective against monthly alcohol use in the low risk sample, and protective against all monthly use in the higher risk sample. Importantly, when both constructs were entered into the same model, spirituality and HAV were independently protective of all monthly use for the higher risk sample and of monthly alcohol use in the lower risk sample. These findings extend earlier work on protective factors. ""Health-as-a-Value"" and spirituality may be protective against substance use in environments with different levels of use.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The number of immigrant and refugee children coming from war-torn countries is increasing in North America. Schools are in a favorable position to implement prevention and intervention programs to address the integration of the past experiences of newcomer children and their adjustment to a new reality. Over the past decades, creative expression activities have been increasingly recognized as a useful way to work with migrant and refugee children. The creative expression workshops that we developed and implemented in Montreal's multiethnic schools are integrated into mainstream academic activities. They have been designed to become transitional spaces allowing newcomer children to bridge partially the gap between the past and the present, the culture of origin and the host country culture, home and school, and the internal and external world of the child. We will describe our program briefly and then focus on four key aspects of the workshops: constructing a safe space, acknowledging and valuing multiplicity, establishing continuity, and transforming adversity.

The sample included 82 low-income, multiethnic women (75% Latina) who completed an 8-week course designed to prepare them to become more active prior to randomization into a 10-month physical activity intervention. Participants completed precourse and postcourse measures. Paired-comparison t tests showed increases in knowledge, perceived social support for exercise, minutes of walking per week, and total cognitive and behavioral processes following the preparatory course. Perceived barriers and self-efficacy for exercise did not change from precourse to postcourse. Preintervention preparatory courses may be an effective way to increase social and cognitive constructs associated with physical activity behavior, potentially yielding a greater effect from subsequent interventions.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The purpose of this study was to explore the psychometric properties of a new functional status measure, the Household and Leisure Time Activities (HLTA) questionnaire, in a multiethnic low-income HIV/AIDS population. The HLTA is an 11-item questionnaire consisting of two scales designed to assess an individual's ability to perform routine home activities (household functioning scale) and to participate in leisure time activities (leisure-time functioning scale). The HLTA was administered, in the form of self-report questionnaires, to 385 consecutive patients seen at a comprehensive HIV/AIDS care facility serving low-income residents of Houston, Texas. Various psychometric procedures were then performed to assess properties, including reliability, construct validity, and concurrent validity. Reliability, assessed by Cronbach's alpha, was good for both scales (0. 92, household functioning; and 0. 94, leisure-time functioning). Validity was supported by findings from the confirmatory factor analysis and findings from the concurrent validity analyses. Overall, the results indicated that the HLTA has satisfactory psychometric properties and is appropriate for use with multicultural low-income HIV/AIDS patients.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The state of Hawai'i is often held up as a ""multiracial""/""multiethnic"" paradise. This is not only because of Hawai'i's ethnic/racial diversity and ""aloha"" spirit, but because of its high rates of ""interracial"" marriage. Using historical material as well as an open-ended qualitative ""mini-survey"" of college students, I dig deeper into this myth by exploring the systems of meaning prevalent in Hawai'i concerning, ""race"", ""ethnicity"", and ""culture"". I argue that, historically, what Hawai'i has exhibited to a much greater degree than most places in the United States is not a ""lack"" of racialization, but a very complex racial/ethnic code, a very nuanced system of racial and ethnic stratification. However, this system of representation contains a strong cultural component; consequently, ""cultural"" symbols (i.e. about ""way of life"" -- food, clothing, mannerisms, etc.) sometimes trump ""racial"" and ""ethnic"" symbolization.

Participants included 896 multiethnic urban students mostly from socioeconomically disadvantaged families. The program focused on developing healthy self-perceptions, and cognitive, affective and behavioral skills. Multiple regression analyses revealed the predicted positive effects of the program on psychological and social outcomes. However, there was also an unexpected negative outcome for a subgroup of students (11%) made vulnerable by stressful family experiences. These findings broaden our understanding of the effects of such programs and underline the need to address the specific coping competencies of students more at-risk.

Recent interest in the concept of emotional intelligence (EI) has increased due to the popular media claiming it to be the most important predictor of life success. Exploration of the relationship between El and specific health behaviors, such as adolescent smoking, is of particular interest. A measure of EI was administered to a subset of students from the control condition of the baseline portion of a longitudinal, school-based experimental smoking prevention trial in a multicultural, urban city. Subjects were 416 actively consented sixth-grade adolescents from public middle schools with a mean age of 11.3 years. 53% were female and the ethnic distribution was 32% Latino, 29% Asian/Pacific Islander, 13% White, 19% Multiethnic, and 6% Other. High EI was related to an increased perception of the negative social consequences of smoking (PSC), higher refusal self-efficacy toward potential cigarette offers (RSE), and less intention to smoke. Those with low EI were more likely to intend to smoke if they had low RSE or were more hostile, while those with high EI were more likely to intend to smoke if they had previously experimented with cigarettes. The association between EI and smoking intentions did not statistically significantly vary across culture/ethnicity. Finally, as EI increased so did PSC for those who were acculturated to the US culture. Inclusion of an EI-enhancing component in smoking prevention programs may be beneficial. Improving EI skills such as identifying emotions within oneself and in others, understanding how emotions come about, and managing emotions can augment existing prevention efforts. With the recent plateau in the success of adolescent smoking prevention programs, identification of such a novel, protective factor as EI brings hope for further reducing adolescent tobacco use.

Most of the existing multiethnic research is not methodologically sound because of poor sampling and inappropriate measures. As a result, multiethnic identity research lacks a theoretical foundation and clear research findings. The goal of this qualitative study was to obtain meaningful information about participants' multiethnic identity development at a level that reflected their true ideas and experiences. Six Chinese/European American participants aged 19 through 42 were interviewed on three occasions in the areas of multiethnic life history, daily life, and meaning making. Participants' collective memories were also assessed to better understand their developmental processes. Several key themes emerged from the data. First, participants' multiethnic self-perceptions ranged on a continuum from internal to external self-perceptions. Second, participants employed three types of self-descriptions: they asserted specific ethnic identities, they used a multitude of terms to reflect their heritages, and they described various ways that they filled out racial/ethnic forms. Third, family members were reported as the most powerful influence on participants' multiethnic self-perceptions via family messages and collective memories. Fourth, multiethnic heritage informed participants' sense of selves, feelings of belonging, and interactions with others. Fifth, participants listed their families, friends, partners, communities, and cultures as the most influential factors on their multiethnic identity development. Sixth, participants' patterns of multiethnic identities were strongly associated with their patterns of memories. Seventh, participants reported that either their multiethnic heritage controlled their lives or they perceived themselves as controlling how their multiethnicity affected their lives. Finally, these individuals reported increasingly positive feelings about themselves as multiethnic people and they articulated that their multiple heritages provided them with a variety of experiences and qualities that they valued. The results of this study may be useful to multiethnic individuals, as well as the people in their lives such as family members, educators, and clinicians. These findings are significant because they provide specific information that may assist better navigation of multiethnic identity development.

The differences associated with factors, such as, demographics, severity of violence, level of danger, harassment, and occurrence of stalking, to disclosure of the IPV to the employer were examined, along with the relationship factors between the presence of a registered nurse or physician at the workplace, and the existence of an employee assistance program. The data were collected by interviewing women from a sample of 112 employed multiethnic women that was stratified into two groups, those who disclosed (n = 79, 70%) and those who did not disclose (n = 33, 30%). No statistically significant difference was found between the ages, education, ethnicity or income of the two groups in relation to their rate of disclosure. Although no statistical significance was found, it was clinically significant that the women in the disclosed group experienced more harassment by their abuser, were reprimanded more, and missed more work than the women of the did not disclose group. The disclosed and non disclosed groups were statistically similar in terms of their mean scores for threats, actual violence, stalking, danger, and worksite harassment. None of these factors influenced the rate of disclosure. Neither the presence of a doctor, nurse or EAP influenced the rate of disclosure. In response to the women's disclose, employers provided assistance including time off from work, advice to seek assistance, and emotional support.

The program was design from an ecological perspective to include four main components (workshops, groups, action project and individual counseling). Participants were 9th grade students at three urban, multiethnic Midwestern high schools. Two evaluation studies were conducted. The first study compared the effectiveness of a minimal treatment intervention (2 hours/2 day workshop) with those in a waiting-list control group. The second study compared the minimal treatment intervention with a full treatment (14-session group) intervention. A quasi-experimental design, including a pre-test, post-test, and follow up, was used. The evaluation was limited to two program components (workshop and 14-session group) and examined which intervention modality was most successful increasing participants' knowledge about teen dating violence, their egalitarian attitudes regarding the roles of men and women in society, their intent to use positive conflict solution strategies and their knowledge about community resources available to teens. Also the evaluation examined the influence that experience with teen dating violence had in the participants' ability to benefit from the program. Study one results indicated that there was no significant difference between the minimal treatment and the waiting-list control group on the outcome variables. Study two results indicated that there was no significant difference between the interventions. However, both the minimal treatment intervention and the full treatment intervention were successful in improving participants' knowledge regarding dating violence and community resources available for teens. This study found no relationship between history of teen dating violence perpetration and victimization and participants' scores on the outcome variables. Overall, results pointed out that, to impact all levels of the ecological model, teen dating violence interventions must be more comprehensive than a workshop or 14-session curriculum. Also, to provide services in multicultural and diverse environments with youth from different ethnic backgrounds and with different dating histories and experiences, it is imperative to understand the influence those characteristics have in the program's ability to influence participants' knowledge, attitudes and behaviors.

Using the rubrics of sense of community and community through place, in-depth interviews, participant observation, and a focus group were conducted to better understand community in the lives of 10 participants. The participants were four self-described lesbians and six self-described gay men ranging in age from 29 to 42. Their ethnicities were 7 white, 1 Filipino, 2 multiethnic (one Chippewa/Ojibwe, Sioux, French, and German, the other Haliwa-Siponi, African American, and Italian). Various themes emerged through the methodology, including the role of diaspora in gay and lesbian community, the importance of media to creating a sense of community, the roles of class, gender, and race in creating gay and lesbian community, the lack of family as a signifier for community, and the role of place in a sense of community. Primary among the themes uncovered was that of a Sense of Safety. This theme underlay each of the other themes. Unlike traditional conceptualizations of a sense of community, my participants each defined community through the potentiality of safety either in the physical locations of community or in the people intentionally chosen to comprise their communities. A primary position of safety within communities was not assumed. It had to be sought out or created. The importance of the role of a Sense of Safety in their conceptualizations of community even affected their interpretations of the events of September 11, 2001. The ability of a Sense of Safety to play an important conceptual role in other communities is also briefly discussed.

Over twenty years of caregiving research has documented many factors that contribute to stress among caregivers. Due to the inherent stresses associated with informal caregiving, and an increase in multi-ethnic elders in the U.S., this study was designed to investigate factors that contribute to caregiving stress among Japanese-American and Caucasian-American caregivers of frail elders. The purpose of this study was to examine a model of factors associated with stress, and to compare the utility of this model in the prediction of stress among Japanese-American and Caucasian-American caregivers of frail elders in Hawaii. Specifically, this study examined the importance of (1) employment status, (2) time spent caregiving, (3) use of formal services, (4) functional ability, (5) social support, (6) health problems, and (7) attitude toward family care in explaining stress among caregivers. Stress was measured by two indicators, depression and life satisfaction. A correlational design was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Participants in this study were 98 Japanese-American and 86 Caucasian-American adult family caregivers who were caring for a frail elder at home. Participants were recruited from two caregiver support groups, two adult day care centers, and one home health care agency on Oahu. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that there were significant differences between the Japanese-American and Caucasian-American samples with regard to the model of factors hypothesized to predict stress among caregivers. Simultaneous multiple regression analyses were used to test the hypothesized relationships between predictor and criterion variables. Decreased social support and more health problems of the caregiver were significant in the prediction of depression among Japanese caregivers; increased employment, decreased service use, and more health problems were significant in the prediction of depression among Caucasian caregivers. The variable ""attitude toward family care"" significantly predicted depression in both groups. Decreased time spent caregiving, increased social support, and stronger attitude toward family care were significant in the prediction of life satisfaction among Japanese caregivers. Only the variable ""attitude toward family care"" was significant in the prediction of life satisfaction among Caucasian caregivers. The results of this study are limited with regard to generalizability. The use of a convenience sample, the use of a correlational design (limiting causal inferences), and modifications made to the ATPLTC scale that measured ""attitude toward family care,"" a scale not previously tested for psychometric properties or for use among multiethnic populations, limit the generalizability of these findings beyond the sample participants. In light of these limitations, future research could examine the continued use of the modified ATPLTC scale among multiethnic populations due to the promising results found in this study. ""Attitude toward family care of elders"" was the only variable that was significant with both samples, and with both indicators of stress. The importance of attitudes in determining behaviors associated with caregiving for frail elders among ethnically diverse caregivers may greatly assist social workers, gerontologists, and other health care professionals in providing culturally competent services and interventions.

Biological and adoptive parents of biracial and multiethnic children were surveyed and interviewed in this study which was guided by seven research questions. Participants for this research were acquired through an organization known as the Interracial Family and Social Alliance of North Texas (IFSA) and through convenience sampling. Major findings of this research indicate that parents of biracial and biethnic children believe that it is important that biracial children know all aspects of their dual or multiethnic heritages. These parents emphasize that it is important to keep an honest and open dialogue about race and ethnicity, physical differences, and history. Parents in this study further stress that schools and communities need to address the unique needs of multiethnic families and biracial/biethnic children.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study explores interaction in same-sex and cross-sex foursquare games, and, in particular, how throwing (and talk) are adjusted along with diverse configurations of players. The game was played among girls and boys with immigrant backgrounds (Syrian, Kurdish, Chilean) from low-income families in a multiethnic school setting in Sweden. The study investigates girls' physicality across various game contexts, finding that as the configuration of players shifts, the forms of bodily actions the girls invoke to construct social identities shift as well. The girls used slams--ways of throwing that require force and muscular strength, physical behaviour that is not conventionally seen as part of femininity. The same girls altered throwing (and language) style, 'throwing like a girl', to downplay physical skills with less skilled girls. In cross-sex games, the girls (and the boys) playfully mock challenged gender meanings such as boys' domination and girls' subordination. Overall, the findings underscore that studies of girls' (and boys') physicality should be grounded in detailed analyses of interaction in specific game contexts, with attention to cultural and institutional frameworks embedded in the games.

The objective is to examine the association between HRQL and early perimenopause and ethnicity, adjusting for health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and sociodemographic factors. Questionnaires were administered to pre- and early perimenopausal women. We studied a cohort of 3302 black, Chinese, Hispanic, Japanese, and white women aged 42 to 52 years from the multisite Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). We measured HRQL, menstrual regularity, and a variety of covariates. HRQL was assessed with 5 subscales from the Short Form-36; impaired functioning was defined as being in the 25% most impaired on a subscale. In unadjusted, but not adjusted, analyses, significantly more early perimenopausal women, as compared with premenopausal women, were classified as having impaired functioning on each of the 5 subscales. For 4 of the subscales, the effect of menopausal status was explained by menopause-related symptoms. Early perimenopause is not associated with impaired functioning when adjusted for symptoms. Significant ethnic differences in HRQL exist.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Focus groups provide an effective means of incorporating the perspectives of ""hidden"" populations in assessments of community health needs and assets. A series of focus groups was conducted with specifically targeted segments of a community to develop a comprehensive picture of community health. The authors describe the focus group process, major findings, and the use of focus group results in a highly multicultural community. Despite differences in age, length of residence, and ethnicity, the focus groups were remarkably similar in the issues raised. The majority of participants viewed the multicultural nature of the community as an asset but voiced some of the difficulties of living in a multiethnic and multilanguage environment. Similar areas of concern in the community arose from all of the focus groups, including housing and other environmental issues and problems of access to health care. Focus group findings have been used to initiate activity addressing identified community problems. Focus group participation had the added benefit of increasing community members' participation in other community endeavors.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The mental health community was caught unaware after 9/11 with respect to treatment of survivors of terrorist attacks. Because this form of trauma was quite rare in the U.S., few trauma specialists had extensive experience, or taught regularly on this subject. Since the primary objective of terrorism is the creation of demoralization, fear, and uncertainty in the general population, a focus on mental health from therapeutic and public health perspectives is critically important to successful resolution of the crisis. Surveys after 9/11 showed unequivocally that symptomatology related to the attacks were found in hundreds of thousands of people, most of whom were not escapees or the families of the deceased. Soon after 9/11, our center formed a collaboration with other academic sites in Manhattan to rapidly increase capacity for providing state-of-the-art training and treatment for trauma-related psychiatric problems. Our experience suggests that evidence-based treatments such as Prolonged Exposure Therapy have proven successful in treating 9/11-related PTSD. However, special clinical issues have arisen, such as the influence of culture on clinical presentation and treatment expectations in a multiethnic community...

Respondents were 12-13 years old in 1994 and 16-17 in 1998. Controlling for demographic and contextual factors, self-regulation--but not risk proneness--was significantly (modestly) associated with overall sexual risk taking 4 years later. Analyses of individual sexual behaviors indicated that self-regulation may affect choices made after becoming sexually active (e.g., number of partners) rather than the initiation of sexual activity. Measures of parent and peer influence had independent effects on sexual risk taking but did not moderate the effects of self-regulation and risk proneness. Findings add to the growing literature on implications of self-regulation for individual development.

This article describes an approach used by Center for Healthy Aging in Santa Monica, California, to implement three projects aimed at Hispanic and African American women to encourage early intervention behaviors. Hispanic and African American volunteers and professional staff work together to establish trusting relationships, join forces with community leaders and develop collaborative approaches to achieve the goal of screening about 1,000 underserved women annually and providing education for an additional 5,000 women. Incorporated in the article are lessons learned about working with this population, the communities in which they live and the use of volunteers for these and other projects.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews Connolly's volume, which chronicles the self reported experiences of a small group of preschool-aged children negotiating the complexities of identity development in a multiethnic, inner-city primary school in England. The reviewer discusses the author's highlighting of the children's social competencies by directly engaging the children in dialogue. In addition, the review claims the work illustrates both the complexity of children's developing identities and contradictory and fluid nature of racism and sexism and the multidirectional relationships between developing identities and discourses on race and gender in communities, cultures, politics, and history. The reviewer praises the book as an excellent resource for rethinking research approaches to studying children, reevaluating theories of children's experiences of racism, revising multicultural and antiracist programming in schools, and moving forward into new research inquiries.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This cross-sectional study documents significant associations between patterns of sexual risk behaviors and psychiatric diagnoses in a multiethnic community sample of young adults (N = 1803) in South Florida. Self-report data regarding sexual behavior and psychiatric symptoms were collected in structured interviews in a follow-up of an earlier school-based study. Cluster analysis was used to group participants with regard to levels of sexual risk behaviors during the past year. Chi-square analysis and ANOVA identified significant associations between cluster membership and (a) lifetime and (b) past year diagnoses for affective disorders, conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, marijuana abuse/dependence, and other drug abuse/dependence. In addition, higher levels of sexual risk behaviors were associated with higher levels of cumulative lifetime psychiatric disorders. Implications for selected prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and the treatment of psychiatric disorders in young adulthood are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"There is now a body of research that has shown that the attitudes of nurses towards substance misuse in the mentally ill are generally suboptimal and this has an impact on the quality of nursing care provided. Despite this, to date there have been no published studies that have examined the attitudes of forensic nurses towards substance misusing forensic service users. Sixty-three multiethnic registered forensic psychiatric nurses based on an inpatient unit in outer London were surveyed using the Substance Abuse Attitude Survey (SAAS). This has five subscores: Treatment Intervention, Treatment Optimism, Permissiveness, Non-Moralism and Non-Stereotypes. Only Permissiveness scores were at an optimum level and equivalent to other community mental health workers. The Treatment Intervention and Treatment Optimism subscores were well below those of a multidisciplinary group of community mental health workers. Three other findings were of note. Firstly, women had higher Non-Moralism scores than men. Secondly, staff nurses had higher Non-Stereotypes scores than other grades. Finally, Black nurses had higher Treatment Optimism scores than non-Black colleagues. In conclusion, the attitudes of forensic nurses towards substance misuse in forensic clients are more suboptimal than other...

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article proposes a conceptual framework for addressing social contextual factors in cancer prevention interventions, and describes work that operationalizes this model in interventions for working class, multiethnic populations. The Harvard Cancer Prevention Program Project includes three studies: (1) an intervention study in 25 small businesses; (2) an intervention study in 10 health centers; and (3) a computer simulation modeling project that translates risk factor modifications into gains in life expectancy and number of cancers averted. The conceptual framework guiding this work articulates pathways by which social context may influence health behaviors, and is used to frame the interventions and guide evaluation design. Social contextual factors cut across multiple levels of influence, and include individual factors, interpersonal factors, organizational factors , and neighborhood/community factors. Social context is shaped by sociodemographic characteristics that impact day-to-day realities. By illuminating the pathways by which social contextual factors influence health behaviors, it will be possible to enhance the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing social inequalities in risk behaviors.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper presents a detailed analysis of the complexities encountered in recruiting research informants who described themselves as African-Caribbean, Pakistani-Kashmiri and white English. Three methods of recruitment were used: (1) advertisements and articles in local media, (2) institutional contacts through local voluntary organizations and (3) interpersonal contacts, referrals and snowballing. We compare and contrast the experiences of ethnically matched interviewers who conducted research amongst the three aforementioned ethnic groups. Our findings suggest that local advertisements and media contact worked best for recruiting members of the white English community in our South English town. Interpersonal contacts were crucial in recruiting Pakistani-Kashmiri informants. Institutional contacts were the most useful way of accessing African-Caribbean individuals. We conclude that local ethnic identities and social networks produce qualitatively different responses to recruitment attempts in different communities. Such differences necessitate the employment of a range of recruitment methodologies and detailed formative research in a target community before commencing recruitment.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: To examine ethnic variation in parenting characteristics and in associations among parenting characteristics and adolescent smoking, and to assess the strength of those associations separately by ethnic subgroup. Methods: Data were collected from a diverse sample (48.4% Hispanic/Latino, 22.9% Asian, 12.1% Non-Hispanic white, and 16.6% Multiethnic) of 1846 Southern California 6th-graders (mean age 11.3 years). Lifetime smoking and parenting characteristics (parental smoking status, adolescents' perceptions of parent-child communication, and parental monitoring) were assessed. Across ethnic groups, descriptive statistics for parenting and smoking variables were calculated and compared. Logistic regression analyses controlled for demographics (socioeconomic status, generation status, family structure, age, and gender) and interaction terms (parenting characteristics x ethnicity), and were also run separately by ethnicity. Results: Asian adolescents reported less parental monitoring than Latino/Hispanics and less parental communication than other ethnic subgroups. Odds ratios indicated parental monitoring (OR=.63; CI=.53-.74; p<.001) and parental communication (OR=.73; CI=.62-.86; p<.001) were protective whereas parental smoking...

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined literature circles in a multiethnic 5th grade classroom, exploring student-led and teacher-led discussions. The social interactions of 2 5th grade females, who often struggled with reading, were investigated, focusing on their literature discussions across the 4 settings of: (1) teacher-directed whole-class discussion of teacher-selected literature; (2) student-led, self-selected heterogeneous group and literature; (3) student-led, self-selected homogeneous group and literature; and (4) teacher-selected book and homogeneous group with teacher-guided discussion. Documentation included observational notes and audio tapes in whole-class and small-group settings, written products, and informal interviews. Results show that, although child-directed literature discussions were rich, meaningful, and inclusive, they were also unproductive and even detrimental. The ability to engage in text-based discussions that affirmed reader competence developed with adult and peer support. When peer support was lacking, the teacher enabled Ss to adopt productive stances in literature discussions and interrupted destructive social practices.

Respondents were African American, Asian American, Haitian American, Latino American, European American and Native American. Respondents viewed HIV/AIDS and medication in terms of, other illnesses and drugs, including colds, cancer, and street drugs. Some recovering drug users expressed concern about ingesting synthetic medication or considered medical regimens as constraining as a drug addiction. Some in the sample also thought antiretroviral medications were toxic, especially when taken in combination. Others thought they should wait to take medication to prevent opportunistic infection until they felt ill. Implications for providers are discussed.

Moreover, a study of psychometric properties of the test where are shown the results of reliability scores and validation evidences of measures (based on the relationship of in-group bias with another variables described in the psychosocial literature) it is reported. These results allow a conclusion that the developed test possesses psychometric properties adapted for multiethnic use.

Demographic composition of the sample was as follows: 78% male, 25% White, 44% Black, and 29% Hispanic. 45% of the participants were infected through men having sex with men (MSM), 35% through heterosexual contact, and 11% through injection drug use. Racial/ethnic minorities reported significantly poorer physical functioning and work-role functioning. Ss with higher nadir CD4 cell counts, MSM HIV exposure, and more education (beyond high school) reported better physical functioning and work-role functioning. Overall QOL and work-related functioning were significantly impaired in this population. The impaired functional status findings hold for every social, demographic, and behavioral subgroup examined. Findings suggest that the influence of social inequality persist even among a universally disadvantaged population.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the importance of potential risk factors for eating disorder onset in a large, multiethnic sample followed up for 3 yrs, with assessment instruments validated for the target population and a structured clinical interview used to make diagnoses. Ss were 1,103 girls initially assessed in grades 6-9 in school districts in Arizona and California. Each year, Ss completed the McKnight Risk Factor Survey, had body height and weight measured, and underwent a structured clinical interview. The McKnight Risk Factor Survey, a self-report instrument developed for this age group, includes questions related to risk factors for eating disorders. During follow-up, 32 girls (2.9%) developed a partial or full-syndrome eating disorder. At the Arizona site, there was a significant interaction between Hispanics and higher scores on a factor measuring thin body preoccupation and social pressure in predicting onset of eating disorders. An increase in negative life events also predicted onset of eating disorders in this sample. At the California site, only thin body preoccupation and social pressure predicted onset of eating disorders. A four-item screen derived from thin body preoccupation and social pressure had a sensitivity 0.72, a specificity of 0.80, and an efficacy of 0.79.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is common in the United States, particularly among middle-aged women for symptoms commonly reported during perimenopause. The study examined the relationship between women's report of perimenopausal symptoms and the use of CAM and socioeconomic or cultural factors. Ss were White, African American, and Hispanic women (aged 30-65 yrs) who were taking part in the ENDOW (Ethnicity, Needs and Decision of Women) project. The project examined women's decision making about hysterectomies and menopausal issues with a focus on ethnic variations and cultural influences. The prevalence of CAM use was 33%; approximately 94% reported use of CAM therapies and 23% used CAM practitioners. Those who used CAM were younger and better educated; more often they reported pelvic pain and painful intercourse. The only demographic factor to predict use of alternative medicine was education.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: This study evaluated the prospective relationship between cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stress and increases in resting blood pressure across a 3-year period among a multiethnic pediatric sample (N=149). Methods: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure; EKG heart rate, pre-ejection period, and mean successive difference of R to R intervals; and impedance-derived measures of cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance were collected during performance of four tasks that elicited different hemodynamic response patterns. Changes from baseline to each task were standardized and averaged to form eight composite scores. Analyses adjusted for time 1 baseline blood pressure and age, body mass index at baseline and change to follow-up, and duration of follow-up. Results: Rises in SBP over the follow-up period were independently predicted by SBP (beta=0.161, p=.009), DBP (beta=0.132, p=.02), and CO (beta=0.144, p=.02) composite measures of reactivity. Rises in DBP over the follow-up period were predicted by DBP (beta=0.292, p=.003, respectively), and MSD (beta=-0.176, p<.03) composite measures of reactivity. TPR reactivity was not related prospectively to blood pressure rises. Conclusions: This study adds to the pediatric literature...

The simulation, consisting of 6 multiethnic teenagers, was brought into the fourth class of Ryerson Polytechnic University's one-semester Advanced Social Groupwork course for students in years 3 or 4 of their BSW program. Excerpts 1, 2, and 3 are followed by feedback to the student worker from the simulators, to demonstrate the possible learning from those on the receiving end of the practice. Incorporated into the analysis sections on the students' interventions is teaching input from the instructors present at the simulation, to show how course content may be incorporated into an experiential learning activity and how ""coaching"" the student workers may prepare them for their next steps. Incorporated also are constructive and supportive comments from peers in the class during the time-out periods, a third means of learning the applied theory of social groupwork. The fourth sphere of learning, personal learning on the part of student workers, is assumed to occur throughout the entire simulation, and in some spots is visible when the same student worker continues after a time-out.

Patients who were diagnosed with cancer four to six months before the study were identified through consecutive registrations on the Hawai'i Tumor Registry. Data were collected through personal interviews using a standardized questionnaire. Among 194 patients who participated in the study, 162 (84%) reported experiencing cancer-related stress. Although few patients had participated in supportive interventions, there was considerable interest in these techniques. Most patients had received information about diagnosis and treatment, but only 10% had received information about psychological counseling. When preferences for supportive interventions were linked with demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, and ethnicity), the most consistent finding was higher levels of interest among Filipino patients. Additional research examining ethnic differences in preferences for psychosocial support is warranted. Because of the potential for greater use of behavioral therapies by patients, educating providers about the availability, efficacy, and patients' interest in such...

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In contemporary German society, growing numbers of youth are resorting to criminality and violence because their exposure to urban social, occupational, and political disintegration involves various forms of social exclusion, destabilization of life contexts, and emotional rejection. In this chapter, I consider whether the city, long heralded as an ""integration machine,"" can continue to produce social cohesion in the face of population diversification through immigration, coupled with poor economic performance and strained systems of social support. I describe the current residential segregation in Germany's multiethnic society and the creation of ethnic colonies. I review recent trends in social exclusion and violence among youth in German cities and propose strategies for dealing with the spatial concentration of disadvantaged youth.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Evidence suggests that minority ethnic people in general and minority ethnic deaf people (MEDP) in particular face numerous formidable obstacles in their attempts to gain access to services in the community. Deaf people from minority ethnic groups who have no English and/or American Sign Language (ASL) skills have particular difficulty gaining access to services. The study therefore was concerned with identifying some of the special needs and difficulties of MEDP who are trying to gain access to services in multiethnic communities. Qualitative approaches were used in data gathering and analysis. The results indicated six areas of difficulty for MEDP in gaining access to services: (a) communication barriers, (b) a lack of recognition of the needs of MEDP, (c) inappropriate service delivery and a lack of information on available services, (d) insufficient cultural sensitivity on the part of service providers, (e) issues of user involvement, and (f) a lack of specific programs for MEDP.

The general assumptions reflected were grounded in the cultural studies tradition. Analysis and interpretation of data collected from participants depended on four areas of research and theory: feminist identity formation, critical pedagogy, critical epistemology and research methodology, and the critical social theory of Habermas (1981). The study utilized the identity formation model of Weir (1996) which places meaning-making in a social-linguistic context and emphasizes the role of mutual recognition in the process. Habermas's ontogenetic theory of identity formation, a component of Weir's model, is also central to the methodological approach of Carspecken (1996) used in this study. The internal colonization theory of Habermas is the basis of Wexler's (1992) model which examines the effects of systems imperatives on the individual identity formation of students and is used in the discussion of data analysis. A qualitative interview technique was employed in order to facilitate the uncovering of the underlying assumptions that structure meaning-making by students, and the process by which they negotiate expectations and limitations from both family and school. Through the interpretation of interview data, the study examined how four female students negotiated meanings about ethnicity, gender, and class within the context of a predominately female, ethnically diverse public school. Therefore, the study had two main goals. The first goal was to explore how students make meaning about their own identity. The second goal was to examine the school as a social site significant to the identity formation of female students. It was shown that students negotiated the expectations and limitations from both family and school and worked to integrate conflicting identities into a coherent sense of self. It was also shown that the school, as a social site, was significant to the identity formation of female students in that it provided the context for the challenges to and the renegotiations of meanings by students. Achievement ideology, which permeated school culture and influenced policy, was shown to serve as a link between economic and bureaucratic systems and identity formation.

Vol.63(1-B), Jul 2002, pp. 583.",0419-4217,,Dissertation Abstracts International,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"The purpose of this study was to test a theory of group-related identity/self that distinguishes the influence of the large scale social cleavages of ethnicity, race, and culture. Definitions of these factors are often confounded, and their unique psychological contributions difficult to interpret. Phinney's ethnic identity theory, Helms' racial identity theory, and Bandlamudi's view of the cultural self are discussed. Ethnic identity is defined in terms of belonging to the people of one's parental heritage(s). Racial identity for both Whites and non-Whites involves responding to racism-attributing character and ability in terms of phenotype. Cultural self refers to the individual's construction of personal meaning using cultural values, products, and behaviors integrated with one's own personality and temperament. Cultural influences may include parents' ethnic cultures and others. Seven multiethnic/multiracial/multicultural young adults (5 females, 2 males) in their 20s and early 30s were interviewed. Each had an immigrant Asian Indian father and an American born (one British), non-Indian mother. Results confirmed that discussions of ethnicity, race, and culture, as defined in this paper, could be differentiated. Subjects used different language and referred to different factors when addressing each. Ethnicity was discussed in terms of birthright and origins, and respondents could choose when and how to participate. Parents' approval was important as was acceptance by coethnics. Racial discussions related to appearance, and respondents referred to race as primarily a White/non-White issue involving politics of positionality; prejudice, experienced or observed; and fairness. Cultural self was discussed in terms of values, strengths, and ways of living. Influences of their parents' ethnic culture(s) or others were discussed in terms of essential self, who they really were. Group-related identity/self is fluid, complex, and incorporates multiple influences. It is situational, that is, it is experienced in relation to local and national social definitions and structures. This theory may improve dialogue on group-related identity/self, help to explain conflicting findings in research, and connect psychology to other scholarly writing on race, ethnicity and culture. Further study will determine whether this theory applies to all, as is asserted in this paper, not just persons with multiple heritages or immigrants.

Prior to the study, focus groups were conducted during which adolescents discussed types of aggressive behavior, situations in which aggression is likely to occur, positive and negative outcomes of aggression, and circumstances in which aggression is justified. From these discussions, two surveys were constructed, the aggressiveness ratings survey and the justifiability survey. These surveys were used to assess adolescents' attitudes in this study. Ninety-eight ninth grade students of various social, cultural, and racial/ethnic backgrounds from a high school in Atlanta, Georgia, participated in this study. In addition to completing the aggressiveness and justifiability ratings surveys, participants completed demographic questionnaires on which they indicated their sex, race, birthplace, parents birthplace, immigrant status, and the type of community (rural, small city, suburban, and big city) they lived in longest. Univariate analyses of variance revealed that sex, immigrant status (marginally), and type of area lived in longest accounted for the most variability in aggressive behavior ratings for this sample. Specifically, females compared to males and those from big cites and both suburban and rural areas compared to those from small town rated acts as more aggressive. Analyses failed to produce significant effects for justifiability of aggression. Discussion focused on the implications of these findings as they relate to previous research, clinical implications, and considerations for future studies with this type of sample. In addition, there is discussion of emergent issues and considerations resulting from conducting this type of study with immigrant and multiethnic participants.

Ninety-four Asian Indian and 134 Caucasian students volunteered to fill out Multiethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), The Teen Timetable (behavioral autonomy), The Coping Strategy Indicator (problem solving, seeking social support, and avoidance coping), and a demographic questionnaire designed for this study. The Asian Indian students were either immigrant or first-generation and all of the parents of these students had been born outside of the United States. Few Caucasian students were foreign-born. The Asian Indian students self reported their grades as mostly As and some Bs, with the Caucasian students having a broader range of self-reported academic performance. Most students' socioeconomic statuses were either middle or upper middle class, with few students classified as lower middle class. Inferential statistics were used to test the five research hypotheses. As expected, Asian Indian adolescents endorsed higher levels of ethnic identity status. No support was found for age or gender-related differences in ethnic identity status. Interaction effects were not statistically significant. Asian Indian students endorsed later expectations for behavioral autonomy when compared to their Caucasian peers, suggesting a tendency for Asian Indian families to preserve aspects of their collectivist values in a society that was predominantly individualistic in orientation. Hypothesized differences in coping strategy preferences based on ethnicity, ethnic identity status, or autonomy expectations were not supported by the data. Adolescent girls tended to use more support seeking strategies than boys. Although the findings of this study did not provide strong support that ethnic identity status and behavioral autonomy affected coping styles, further research is needed to determine if students with diverse ethnic backgrounds differ in their approach to problem solving.

This study intended to examine the status of cooperation among ethnic congregations of multiethnic Catholic parishes, to identify the factors influencing this cooperative alliance, and to explore the relationships between demographic, organizational, and psychological variables and the parishioners' cooperative attitude. Theoretical framework. Since cooperation in a multiethnic context is a complex social phenomenon, the theoretical framework of the study includes conceptual components from several branches of learning: cooperation theories, diversity management, social psychology, and contact hypothesis. Methodology. The researcher collected data from 396 parishioners of six multiethnic/multicongregational parishes of the diocese of Orange, California using his partially customized survey instrument, and analyzed them with both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. Findings. The data analysis revealed that shared goals are the most significant predicator of the status of cooperation, and status inequality is an especially manifest issue among ethnic congregations. There is a positive correlation between the parishioners' cooperative attitude and their inter-ethnic contact. A positive relationship was also found between the parishioners' cooperation and both their parish identification and their ethnic congregation identification. In addition, there is a significant difference between parishioners of diverse positions within parish organization in displaying their inter-ethnic cooperation; however, no significant difference was found between parishioners from diverse ethnic groups. Implications and recommendations. The study results can take the theories of reference beyond their conventional contentions by suggesting a contextualization of social identification, the importance of ideological factor in diversity management, and the priority of affective dimension in social contact. Three specific recommendations regarding multiethnic ministry policy consisting of joint parish pastoral councils, fair resource reallocation, and diversity leadership development for priests and lay leaders were also proposed with the purpose of improving cooperative relationship among ethnic congregations. The study resulted in noteworthy findings, yet future research on the topic needs more creative designs and more advanced methodology to draw a clearer picture of the phenomenon.

Utilizing survey data collected from a multiethnic sample of college students, the goals of the dissertation research were to measure endorsement various interethnic ideologies (or ideals for how an ethnically diverse society should optimally function), to determine what important variables predict endorsement of the ideologies, and to examine how these differing ideologies influence opinions about public policy. The research demonstrates that there are real differences between white and ethnic minority participants in group perceptions and in the construal of issues related to managing ethnic diversity. Relative to white participants, ethnic minority participants endorsed a multicultural ideology to a greater extent, saw greater cultural differences between ethnic groups, expressed more positive sentiments toward the ingroup, reported higher levels of Collective Self-Esteem, and were more likely to support prodiversity public policies. Also, the research demonstrates that those who adopt a multicultural ideology are able to positively value diversity-to see more differences between groups and to have more positive sentiments toward outgroups.

However, research that looks at anti-violence instructors' and their students' discussions about masculinity and male violence within the context of anti-violence education remains sparse. In addition, the limited work on boys' own views of masculinity has focused primarily on White boys' experiences with hegemonic masculinity. This latter research is also Australian, British, and American, with little in the Canadian context. The purpose of this study is to explore, through semi-structured interviews, the talk of a small multiethnic sample of anti-violence teachers, boys, and girls on masculinity and male violence within the context of their gender, culture, and ""race."" Twenty-six grade 10 students (12 male, 14 female) who completed a school-sponsored violence prevention program in two Canadian high schools and six (three male, three female) antiviolence instructors who taught the program were interviewed. All interviews were tape recorded and transcribed for analysis. Drawing on a feminist poststructuralist framework in my analysis, four main themes emerged. First, many boys played hegemonic masculinity in certain situations due to their perception that it was necessary, while engaging in non-oppressive masculinities in other situations. Second, girls not only reinforced, albeit sometimes unintentionally, boys' hegemonic masculinity talk and practices, but many also struggled with challenging a dominant image of manhood. Third, ""race"" and culture were found to play a significant role in considerations of masculinity. Fourth, everyone's talk revealed the connection between hegemonic masculinity and male violence. The findings from this study suggest that drawing on feminist poststructuralism in developing a framework for conceptualizing masculinity would serve as a useful tool in teaching anti-violence programs to diverse groups of boys (and girls).

The article distinguishes categories of norms that may affect drug use. Regression analysis of self-reports by 434 American Indian seventh graders (aged 11-15 yrs) attending middle schools in a large southwestern US city indicates that students who had a more intense sense of ethnic pride adhered more strongly to certain antidrug norms than those who did not. Whereas American Indian students with better grades in school held consistently stronger antidrug norms, there were few differences by gender, socioeconomic status, or age. These results have implications in social work practice for better understanding and strengthening the protective aspects of American Indian culture in drug prevention efforts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The Adolescent Transitions Program (ATP) promotes student adjustment and reduces risk within a public school setting, focusing primarily on parenting practices using a tiered, multilevel prevention strategy. A description is given of the program, levels of engagement, and intervention effects. Within each school, multiethnic students (N = 672; sixth graders; 52% male) and their families were randomly assigned at the individual level to a control condition or the ATP intervention. Analyses focus on the longitudinal effects of the ATP intervention on self-reported substance use through middle school and the 1st year of high school (Grades 6, 7, 8, and 9). Levels of engagement in the selected and indicated interventions were somewhat less than expected. Despite relatively low levels of engagement, the intervention reduced initiation of substance use in both at-risk and typically developing students. These findings are discussed with respect to lessons learned about parent engagement, optimizing strategies for schoolwide implementation, and the promise of embedding family interventions within the public school ecology.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Investigated influences of environment, parenting, demography, and economy on the activities of children in Botswana, and their roles in family and society. Subjects comprised 10 children (aged 3-8 yrs), 15 youth (aged 9-18 yrs), 11 adults (aged 19-45 yrs), and 8 older adults (aged 45+ yrs) residing in a multiethnic community in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Collected data included behavioral observation, experimental test data concerning ability to do productive tasks, and household demographic and economic data. Results show that development of adult competency in specific tasks entailed a step-like relationship between growth- and experience-based forms of embodied capital in the ontogeny of ability acquisition. There was a trade-off between the acquisition of experience-based embodied capital in the form of skills and knowledge, and immediate productivity among children. Time allocation to these alternatives was primarily determined by short- and long-term costs and benefits to parents of investment in children's embodied capital. Availability of laborers and overall labor requirements of the household were both major determinants of investment in alternate forms of embodied capital and resulting variation in children's time allocation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Normative personality change over 40 years was shown in 2 longitudinal cohorts with hierarchical linear modeling of California Psychological Inventory data obtained at multiple times between ages 21-75. Although themes of change and the paucity of differences attributable to gender and cohort largely supported findings of multiethnic cross-sectional samples, the authors also found much quadratic change and much individual variability. The form of quadratic change supported predictions about the influence of period of life and social climate as factors in change over the adult years: Scores on Dominance and Independence peaked in the middle age of both cohorts, and scores on Responsibility were lowest during peak years of the culture of individualism. The idea that personality change is most pronounced before age 30 and then reaches a plateau received no support.

This study estimated a model that included pathways linking economic conditions to the internalizing and externalizing symptoms of a multiethnic sample of urban adolescents. Similar to other prominent models, this model included parental distress and parenting as key constructs, but the expanded ecological model also included stressors outside the family and adolescents' associations with deviant peers as possible explanatory factors. Data from 300 adolescents and their parents were consistent with a model that showed linkages between economic conditions, parental depressive symptoms, supportive parenting, and internalizing symptoms. Stressors outside the family were associated with deviant peer affiliations which, in turn, predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The implications of these findings for understanding economic conditions' influence on adolescents' mental health are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article examines the issue of school suspension by looking at the sociocultural factors that influence a teacher's decision to remove a student from the classroom. The authors use enthographic and discourse analytic approaches to study how disciplinary moments are constructed by students and teachers in a Midwest urban high school. The analysis of classroom observations, videotaped lessons, and interviews from a longitudinal study at this multiethnic high school shows that suspensions frequently occur in the absence of physical violence or blatant verbal abuse. Suspensions are often preceded by a complex series of nonviolent events when one disruptive act among many is singled out for action by the teacher. This study has implications for current debates about zero-tolerance policies. Our analysis suggests that removing a student from class is a highly contextualized decision based on subtle race and gender relations that cannot be adequately addressed in school discipline problems.

These students participated in an enrichment program designed to prepare high school students for college success. The results suggest that the affective quality of maternal attachment is positively associated with grade point average, and the affective quality of paternal attachment is negatively associated with depressive symptoms. In Study 2, case examples provide an examination of sources of support, life stress, and patterns of resilience. Implications for prevention and intervention are also discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article reports on the development and testing of a measure of spiritual well-being, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp), within 2 samples of cancer patients. The instrument comprises 2 subscales--one measuring a sense of meaning and peace and the other assessing the role of faith in illness. A total score for spiritual well-being is also produced Study 1 (1,617 Ss; mean age 54.6 yrs) demonstrates good internal consistency reliability and a significant relation with quality of life in a large, multiethnic sample. Study 2 (131 Ss; aged 20-82 yrs)examines convergent validity with 5 other measures of religion and spirituality in a sample of individuals with mixed early stage and metastatic cancer diagnoses. Results of the 2 studies demonstrate that the FACIT-Sp is a psychometrically sound measure of spiritual well-being for people with cancer and other chronic illnesses.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the effects of both regular viewing habits and experimental exposure on students' conceptions about sexual relationships. A multiethnic sample of 259 undergraduates aged 18-22 was assigned to view a set of clips depicting either 1 of 3 sexual stereotypes or neutral, nonsexual content. Participants then completed measures assessing their attitudes about sexual roles and relationships, their assumptions about the sexual experiences of their peers, and their regular viewing habits. Both correlational and experimental connections emerged between TV viewing and students' sexual attitudes and assumptions. More frequent and more involved viewing were repeatedly associated with students' support of the sexual stereotypes surveyed. Similarly, women exposed to clips representing a particular sexual stereotype were more likely to endorse that notion than were women exposed to nonsexual content. Finally, both experimental exposure and aspects of regular viewing significantly predicted students' sexual attitudes and assumptions, even with demographics and previous sexual experiences controlled. Final subscales for attitudes about dating and sexual relationships mesure are appended.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This paper reviews the model-building approach to developmental psychopathology as it applies to understanding the influence of peers on adolescent problem behavior. Considerable longitudinal evidence suggests that deviant peer involvement is prognostic of escalations in various forms of problem behavior, including substance use, delinquent behavior, and violence. Most convincing, however, are data from randomized intervention trials that show alarming iatrogenic effects for aggregating high-risk peers. This paper shows that intervention research can also clarify the role of parents in reducing deviant peer involvement. Results from a 4-year prevention trial are reported for a community sample of 671 multiethnic middle school youth (aged 11 yrs). Random assignment to family-centered services in a school Family Resource center produced reduced growth in deviant peer involvement. The extensiveness of the parenting intervention was correlated with reduced growth in deviant peer involvement, especially among high-risk youth. Findings are discussed with respect to developmental theory and the design of future intervention trials that clarify the role of adults in structuring the emerging adolescents' world of peers.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Evaluated (1) the temporal stability of hemodynamic responses to three tasks using impedance cardiography, and (2) the influence of aging on stress responses in a multi-ethnic pediatric sample. 100 Black and White children 8 to 10 years old and 49 adolescents 15 to 17 years old were tested at study entry and on average 3 years later. It was hypothesized that upon retest, the female children would resemble the female adolescents, that is, both female age groups would show greater cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) responses to tasks than males, whereas both male age groups would show greater total peripheral resistance (TPR) responses. Results show that the composite task-induced changes in SV, CO, TPR, and pre-ejection period were moderately stable across 3 years (rs = .36 to .51), with children showing greater stability in task-induced CO change than did adolescents. However, the magnitude of the participant's stress responses changed over time, varied by task, age group, and gender. These results suggest that hemodynamic responses to stress change with aging during childhood and adolescence and that they can be measured reliably.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Identified sociodemographic differences in the incidence of the subtypes of first ever stroke in a multiethnic population. A prospective community stroke register (1995-8) was developed using multiple notification sources and pathological and clinical classifications of stroke. A multiethnic population of 234,533 in south London, of whom 21% are black was studied. A total of 1,254 cases were registered. The average age of stroke was 71.7 years with black patients being 11.3 years younger than white patients. The incidence rate/1000 population was 1.33 (crude), 1.28 (European adjusted) with a 2.18 (95% CI 1.86 to 2.56) age and sex adjusted incidence rate ratio in the black population. The black group had a significantly higher incidence of all subtypes of stroke except for posterior lacunar infarcts and unclassified strokes. The incidence rate ratio for men compared with women was 1.34 (95% confidence interval (95% CI). Although the black population is at increased risk of stroke and most subtypes of stroke, this is not translated into significant differences in survival. Hence black/white differences in mortality are mainly driven by incidence of stroke.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Measured the effect of giving out free smoke alarms on rates of fires and rates of fire related injury in a deprived multiethnic urban population using a cluster randomized controlled trial. Participants were primarily households including elderly people or children and households in housing rented from the borough council in 2 boroughs of inner London, UK. 20,050 smoke alarms, fittings, and educational brochures were distributed free and installed on request. Main outcome measures were the rates of fires and related injuries during 2 yrs after the distribution; alarm ownership, installation, and function. Results show that giving out free smoke alarms did not reduce injuries related to fire (rate ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.9), admissions to hospital and deaths (1.3; 0.7 to 2.3), or fires attended by the fire brigade (1.1; 0.96 to 1.3). Similar proportions of intervention and control households had installed alarms (36/119 [30%] vs 35/109 [32%]); odds ratio 0.9; 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.7) and working alarms (19/118 [16%] vs 18/108 [17%]; 0.9; 0.4 to 1.8). It is concluded that giving out free smoke alarms in a deprived, multiethnic, urban community did not reduce injuries related to fire, mostly because few alarms had been installed or were maintained.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study was undertaken to assess the effect of a 28-day detention and treatment program, in a multiethnic county with high rates of alcohol-related arrests and crashes, on 1st-time offenders sentenced for driving while impaired (DWI). The article also provides preliminary findings from a comprehensive DWI intervention program that includes a high proportion of Native American clients in the treatment cohort. Researchers used comparison of baseline characteristics, survival curves of subsequent arrest, and Cox proportional hazards regression to examine probability of re-arrest of those sentenced and those not sentenced to the program. Probability of not being arrested was significantly higher for the treatment group after adjustment for covariates. At 5 yrs, probability of not being re-arrested for the treatment vs the nontreatment group was 76.6% vs 59.9%. The results suggest that this county's program has significantly affected re-arrest rates for Native Americans, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Whites.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the accuracy of females' self-reports of mammograms and Pap smears in a multiethnic, multilingual population. Subjects (Ss) comprised 1,464 African-American, Latina, Chinese, Filipina, and White females (ages 40-74 yrs) residing in low-income census tracts of Alameda County, California. Ss completed telephone surveys concerning receipt of mammograms and Pap smears, Additional collected data included many Ss' computerized and written medical records. Results show that 94.9% of Ss reported having had a Pap smear, and 87% reported having had a mammogram. For those Ss whose records were available, only 69.4% of self-reports could be validated; for mammography, 75.4%. Validation rates differed significantly by ethnicity and site of care for both Pap smears and mammograms. It is concluded that population estimates of breast and cervical cancer screening rates based upon patient self-reports need to be adjusted downward significantly for low-income, ethnic females.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined 10 Black child welfare workers' perceptions of transracial adoption (TRA) and foster care placement (FCP). Informants were asked to discuss their attitudes toward the placement of Black children with White families, as well as their perception of the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 and the supplemental Interethnic Adoption Provision of 1996. This study expands existing research regarding the viability of TRA and FCP by incorporating the previously ignored perceptions of social service professionals who are charged with the responsibility of providing child and family services. Findings illuminate the significant role that prioritization of client need plays in the perceptions of workers.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Determines if race and ethnicity, health beliefs, and cancer knowledge are associated with delays in care for abnormal Pap smears. We conducted a mailed survey with telephone follow-up of all women with an abnormal Pap smear who received care at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center between October 1998 and October 1999 (n = 1,049). A delay in care was defined as not attending the first scheduled clinic visit to follow up on an abnormal Pap smear, or requiring multiple contact attempts, including a certified letter, to schedule a follow-up visit. Our response rate was 70% (n = 733) and the sample was 51% Latina. Spanish-speaking Latinas and women of Asian descent were more likely to endorse fatalistic beliefs and misconceptions about cancer. Thirteen percent of the sample delayed follow-up on their abnormal Pap smear. Women who delayed care were more fatalistic and endorsed more misconceptions about cervical cancer. Delays in care were not independently associated with race and ethnicity. Health beliefs and cancer knowledge differed by race and ethnicity among women in a large managed care organization. Fatalistic health beliefs and misconceptions about cancer, but not race and ethnicity, were independently associated with delays in care.

This project provided health services and developed educational programs for this underserved population. To facilitate entry into the Asian community, the College established clinical sites at 2 schools that had the highest concentration of Asians in Mobile County's public schools. The purpose of the project was to develop a new curriculum, to involve nursing students in community-based practice, and to provide health care services in the community. The health services, educational programs, and community instructional activities generated substantial outcomes for the targeted population as well as nursing students. Nursing students learned to assess aggregates, plan, and evaluate interventions. The learning outcomes of the nursing students were evaluated using objectives developed in accordance with B. S. Bloom's (1956) Taxonomy. The project not only complemented and expanded existing school health services and programs but also filled the void in some health service and program areas. Preliminary evaluation of the project revealed overwhelmingly positive feedback from both the nursing students and school teachers.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study examined relations among attachment to parents and peers, cognitive ability, psychosocial functioning variables, and academic achievement in a multiethnic sample of 357 college students (aged 18-24 yrs). A small subgroup (14.8%) of students reported low levels of attachment to both parents and peers. Significant positive correlations were documented between parent and peer attachment and several indices of psychosocial competence. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses reveal that indices of cognitive ability were significant predictors of college students' grade point averages, while broader measures of functioning in early adulthood (attachment, intellectual ability, self-esteem) were significant predictors of scholastic competence. Results suggest that perceived attachment to both parents and peers is a component of wider patterns of social competence and adjustment that may function as protective or compensatory factors during key transitions in young adulthood, such as participation in college, and with its attendant demands for academic achievement.

This is a methodological paper, sharing the lessons learned in the field by one research team. It reports on a study of persons with type 2 diabetes (aged 25-62 yrs) and their partners that included both Latino and European-American participants. Involvement of a multiethnic research team, the willingness to be flexible, and a healthy skepticism about our current methods are among the suggestions that emerge.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Since the 1996 Peace Accords, bilingual education in Guatemala has become a major concern among educators, but little is known about how teachers of different ethnicity view and interact with Mayan and ladino children. Using terminology employed by teachers as a basis for cognitive categorization of ethnicity, cultural domain analysis examined teachers' perceptions of student characteristics. The categorizations were then related to observed teacher-student interaction in rural primary school classrooms. The results suggest ethnic and cultural differences in teacher cognition, as ladino teachers categorized Mayans more positively and were highly homogeneous in their classification of indigenous students and Mayan teachers viewed ladino students more positively and were more homogeneous in their classification of students like themselves. Both teachers and students initiated more interactions with those of their own ethnicity. The findings support the greater use of Mayan teachers, but in multiethnic settings there may not be equal learning opportunities for students who do not share their teachers' ethnicity.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Makes the case for a different motivational approach to the study of the academic challenges of some African-American youth, one that focuses on the values component of expectancy-value theory. The authors elaborate their approach to studying achievement values in the context of ethnicity and development. The chapter begins with a brief historical overview of early motivation research on the achievement syndrome that tried to tackle some of the issues related to race and achievement values. Next, the authors turn to perspectives from the disciplines of sociology, anthropology, and social psychology that offer explanations for the presumed devaluing of achievement among African Americans. Then the authors present some of their own empirical research that addresses these issues. Although the focus remains on African-American youth, the perspective is broadened to include multiethnic samples who share some of the same motivational beliefs and school achievement patterns as their African-American counterparts. The chapter concludes with recommendations for future motivation theory and research.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The promotion of refugees' well-being and integration depends upon how our communities value diversity and provide opportunities for meaningful involvement. An ecological perspective suggests that it is important to consider not only the characteristics of individuals but also to examine the extent to which particular settings are able to facilitate the participation of community members. The purpose of this study was to understand the participation experiences of 54 Hmong refugees (aged 19-78 yrs) living in multiethnic housing developments. Interviews revealed that while Hmong residents valued participation highly, most were excluded from meaningful avenues of participation because of multiple barriers, including language differences, time constraints, and discrimination. No supports to address these barriers existed in their communities. It is important to understand and build individuals' capacities to participate and communities' capacities to promote involvement, integrate diversity, and foster interdependence. Participation is fundamental to the process of enabling refugees to become an integral part of their new communities and is a potential way for them to regain a sense of control over their lives and the decisions that affect them.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter presents a study that utilizes the context of multiethnic high school sports teams to understand the sources of intergroup conflict. The work presented in this chapter is based on ethnographic data and player journals. The authors examine a girls volleyball team and a boys basketball team in Los Angeles County. The results show that the 1st case of conflict in the girls volleyball team shows how value differences can animate subtle interpersonal conflict. At the heart of this conflict was the contrast between the individualistic emphasis on self-esteem and the protection of self-esteem in front of others vs the collectivistic emphasis of promoting personal modesty. The 2nd case of team conflict came from the boys basketball team and shows the conditions for aggressive conflict. A different source of conflict was salient for this team. It had racial bias. The societal domination of basketball in the US by African Americans was reflected in a racially-labeled hierarchy of players on this team.

Differences in the communication and organizational skills of the 2 sets of participants quickly emerged. Although the community initiative had been established primarily as a coalition between the neighborhood association and the parents association, neither community-based organization was ready to venture into the coalition. The parents association was numerically large and vibrant, while the neighborhood association was numerically small and stagnant. There was a clash of cultures, with each organization wanting to operate in a manner that felt right and comfortable. The leaders of both groups were unable to, and, in some cases, unwilling to work with the other.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the associations between male and female alcohol problems and drug use and risk of moderate and severe male intimate partner violence (IPV) in general household population samples. A multiethnic sample of 1,615 married and cohabiting couples was obtained from the 1995 National Study of Couples, a cross-sectional study on alcohol and IPV. The authors assessed the contribution of past year male and female alcohol-related problems and illicit drug use to the risk of moderate and severe male IPV. A series of generalized multinomial logit models, with adjustment for sociodemographic and psychosocial covariates, was constructed to assess these associations. Results indicate that female and male alcohol-related problems and female drug use were associated with increased risk of moderate and severe male IPV. Contrary to expectations, male drug use was not associated with elevated risk for either type of male IPV. Compared with couples residing in low-unemployment neighborhoods, couples residing in high-unemployment neighborhoods were at greater risk for severe, but not moderate, male IPV. It is concluded that alcohol-related problems among men and women and drug use among women appear to be important correlates of male IPV severity among couples in the general population.

The authors do so in the context of an applied interest in the current policy emphasis on partnerships between government and local communities in initiatives to reduce health inequalities, and a conceptual interest in the role of social representations in perpetuating unequal power hierarchies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 75 residents of a deprived multiethnic area in south England. Informants described themselves as African-Caribbean, Pakistani and White English; half men and half women, aged 15-75 yrs. The authors draw attention to the way in which ethnic identities may be constructed in ways that undermine the likelihood of local community participation. Stereotypical representations of ethnically defined ingroups and outgroups (the ethnic ""other') constituted key symbolic resources used by our informants in accounting for their low levels of engagement with local community networks. The authors examine the content of these stereotypes, and highlight how their construction is shaped by historical, economic and social forces, within the context of the ""institutional racism' that exists in England.

Half of the Ss lived in households with pets where ownership was more common among Whites; 55% lived in detached single family homes and 28% lived in households with annual incomes above $40,000. Interview results showed that ratings of pet importance varied with racial/ethnic group and income. Also, the absence of siblings in the household, having sole responsibility for one's pet, and owning a cat or dog were associated with higher levels of pet importance. The considerable variability as a function of race/ethnicity in the likelihood of owning a pet, and the nature of the adolescent's relationship to his/her pet, indicate for future research the benefit of using diverse samples and of attempting to determine the role of pets in the family as a culturally bound phenomenon.

Ethnic identity development may be an especially complex challenge facing biethnic and multiethnic individuals, who are often forced to choose one ethnicity. As children of interracial relationships, biracial and multiracial youth have legitimate claims to multiple ethnic heritages, yet these heritages are often not recognized due to skin color, appearance or name. This study examined the differences in ethnic identity development among adolescents, particularly focusing on multiethnic individuals, exploring the relationships among ethnic identity and self-esteem, ethnic identity and psychological adjustment, and ethnic identity and parental attachment. Two hundred and fifty-one participants completed four pencil and paper measures; the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1990), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), the Achenbach Youth Self-Report (1991) and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Greensburg & Arsmden, 1987). A series of one-way analysis of variance revealed that multiethnic participants scored significantly lower on ethnic identity than both African-Americans and Latinos. As predicted, Multiethnics showed no difference in psychological adjustment and self-esteem, as compared to their monoethnic counterparts. In addition, it was found that the relationship to mother and father was significantly correlated to psychological adjustment, but not to self-esteem. It was revealed in a series of multiple regressions that the relationship to mother, father and ethnic identity achievement accounted for 38% of the variance in psychological adjustment. Lastly, a somewhat limited finding is that having an African-American friend conferred the most significant contribution, predicting 8% of the variance in ethnic identity.

Empirical and theoretical literature concerning this population has been limited and often inconclusive. With continued growth of a multiethnic/multiracial movement issues concerning this population are becoming more salient. The current study investigated ethnic identity, self-esteem, and adjustment among Japanese-African Americans and Japanese-European Americans. The sample consisted of 86 biethnic adults (54 Japanese-European Americans, 32 Japanese-African Americans). Subjects were recruited at local college campuses, through multiethnic organizations, and through snowballing techniques. Subjects completed materials that were mailed to them. The study was correlation with a pre-experimental, cross-sectional design. Heritage Combination (majority/minority, minority/minority) was the primary predictor variable with Gender, Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity comprising additional predictor variables. Instrumentation included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) (Rosenberg, 1965), the Adjective Check List (ACL) (Gough & Heilbrun, 1965), and the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) (Phinney, 1992). Results of the study provided a greater understanding of the heterogeneity within the biethnic community and the need to look further at process as well as outcome. Japanese-African Americans and Japanese-European Americans did not significantly differ in their decisions to identify monoethnically versus biethnically, though monoethnic identifiers were more likely to be male. In terms of ethnic identity as measured by the MEIM, Japanese-African Americans were more likely to assert higher ethnic affirmation and belonging than Japanese-European Americans when education and parental support were sufficient. On remaining aspects of ethnic identity, the predictor variables of Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity accounted for a significant amount of variance in ethnic identity. Relative to self-esteem as measured by the RSE, Heritage Combination was not predictive of self-esteem, though the predictor variables of Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity added significantly to the prediction of self-esteem. In general, irrespective of heritage combination, subjects appeared to have high levels of self-esteem. In terms of adjustment measured by the ACL - PADJ, neither Heritage Combination or any predictor variables contributed significantly to the prediction of adjustment. However, in general, the sample represented a well adjusted group of individuals as evidenced by an ability to effectively manage life's stressors and to maintain a positive outlook.

Included in those numbers will be individuals who have two racial group heritages, though only one part of their racial background may be minority. Typically, these individuals will be considered, exclusively, as members of the minority community which negates the existence of their ""other half"". Existing research studies on the racial identity development of biracial individuals has been replete with studies on the identity development of offspring from Black/White or White/other unions, with little emphasis on the similarities and differences between these minority-majority biracials. This exploratory study serves the following purposes: (1) determine which factors may predict biracial identity choice for minority-majority biracials, (2) examine whether statistically significant differences exist between demographic factors and the psychological factors of biracial identity and self-esteem for minority-majority biracials, (3) explore the possibility of a relationship between racial identity and physical characteristics for minority-majority biracials. Fifty-six (56) minority-majority biracials--of Asian/Caucasian, Black/Caucasian, and Hispanic/Caucasian racial heritages--completed the Biracial Identity Attitude Scale, a revised version of the Multiethnic Identity Measure and the Rosenberg Self-esteem scale. Four of the participants took part in a phone interview to enhance the information collected by these instruments and add a more personalized perspective on the biracial identity process. Correlational analysis was used to study the relationship between racial identity, self-esteem, and various demographic factors (i.e., age, gender). Results suggest that minority-majority biracials tend to associate their experiences as biracials with their minority parent, although they may choose to embrace both of their racial heritages. Recommendations for parents, mental health professionals, teachers, and others who serve biracial populations are presented in order to promote a better understanding of the biracial identity process leading to more effective services.

Results show that the program did not significantly affect alcohol use during early adolescence: a decrease was observed among the 6th grade Ss, and an increase was found among the 8th grade Ss. However, the project exerted significantly positive effects on several variables related to alcohol abuse. At 18-mo follow-up, 6th grade students reported higher self-esteem, better peer pressure resistance skills, and a more positive relationship with their fathers compared to controls. Eighth grade students were also more inclined to get involved in community activities related to substance abuse prevention, and were more likely to choose alternatives to substance abuse in their leisure time compared to controls.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The mission of the California Adolescent Nutrition and Fitness (CANFit) Program-to improve the nutritional status, including physical fitness, of California's low-income, African-American, Latino, Asian, and American Indian youth 10 to 14 yrs old-is based upon the results of an extensive needs assessment conducted in 1990 in California. The assessment revealed increased nutritional needs, yet lack of nutrition education and fitness programs for low-income multiethnic adolescents. This paper describes the evolution of the CANFit Program, and how it empowers community-based organizations to develop and implement nutrition education and physical activity programs for ethnic adolescents from low-income communities. The CANFit program provides nutrition and physical activity information and resources to support organizations in developing their own ethnic-specific intervention strategies. The 1st part relates the theoretical rationale for the program, drawing on data collected in a statewide needs assessment and the author's previous experience. The 2nd section demonstrates the relevance and importance of the CANFit Program strategy of working within the context of youth-serving organizations based in low-income, ethnic communities.

A multiracial sample of adults (N = 4,025) was used to examine neighborhood racial composition preferences-an important, individual-level explanation for residential segregation-and address 3 shortcomings in existing research. The author extended analysis of the cause of preferences beyond racial stereotypes to include parenting, homeownership, perceptions of social class difference, and common fate identity. Also tested, directly, were the effects of these factors on preferences for same-race neighbors. Results lend strong support to race-based explanations of preferences. As stereotypes toward out-groups became more negative, preferences for integration decreased; Blacks were consistently perceived in unfavorable terms, and were, consensually, the least preferred out-group neighbors. There was also limited support for so-called class-based explanations of preferences, homeowners preferred fewer Black neighbors. Generally, results suggest both greater resistance to integration with Blacks than previously thought, but more openness to integration than currently exists.

The study was conducted in the first week of October 1999. The method used was standardised interviews, which were applied to a representative sample of 100 citizens of Novi Sad. The sample included quota and criteria such as gender, age and education. The subjects reported ethnic distance towards all the groups, although the level of distance towards different groups differed. The highest ethnic distance, in terms of all proposed relationships, is reported towards the Albanians, then towards the Roma, the Croats, and the Hungarians. On the basis of the results obtained, one can conclude that the citizens of Novi Sad do experience ethnic distance, and that this is expressed differently towards different ethnic groups. However, that distance was significantly lower than earlier as shown in results obtained in the broader region of Vojvodina and Serbia.

For these reasons, the contributors were asked to pay special attention to the results section of their contributions. As treatment is intrinsically difficult to research, there are fewer treatment-related studies (although we also included a few contributions which are primarily descriptions of treatment programs, rather than presentations of research results).

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Tested two models that have been developed to explain risk and resiliency in drug prevention, and attempted to compare the effects of these two factors across gender and ethnicity. One of the models posits that separate elements make up each set and the other posits that a single factor can be either a risk or a resiliency factor depending on the presence or absence of resiliency or risk. A survey regarding past drug use was administered to a multiethnic sample of 609 seventh-grade students. The authors expected to find that high risk and/or low resiliency adolescents should report a higher level of involvement with drugs than high resiliency and/or low risk adolescents, and that the effects of risk and resiliency are moderated by gender and ethnicity. Results support the model in which risk and resiliency factors are a discrete set of factors and demonstrate that overall resiliency factors play a larger role than risk factors in substance use and drug resistance processes. Early interventions are important for both genders, but resiliency factors must be dealt with before initiation of substance use for males. Findings did not differ substantially across ethnicity.

Children were asked to categorize and indicate preferences with respect to 8 hypothetical contemporaries in different situations that were described by a combination of ethnicity, gender, and a psychological characteristic. Results show that Ss preferred to use psychological characteristics for categorization and that the use of ethnic categories was domain-dependent (i.e., ethnicity was used less often in indicating preferences for playing than preferences for working on an educational task and for explaining quarrels). They also indicate that the use of ethnic categories was affected by stereotypes. The widely accepted idea that ethnicity plays a central role in the judgments of children in multiethnic situations may be overstated.

Interviewer-administered semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires were used to obtain data on usual diet and supplement use from 130 community-dwelling residents (aged 70-94 yrs). Results indicated that 47% of the Ss reported using 1 or more supplement products, and that African Americans were significantly less likely to take supplements than Native Americans or European Americans. Based on dietary intakes, 65% of the Ss were found to be deficient for at least 1 nutrient. It is noted that the use of supplement products for 8 nutrients investigated was not related to dietary nutrient deficiency and that for all nutrients investigated, except iron and calcium, a greater proportion of those without dietary deficiency took a supplement product than those with deficiency. Also, ethnicity and gender were found to be significant predictors of supplement use. The authors suggest that although both dietary deficiencies of vitamins and minerals and supplement use are relatively high in this population, there is no association between supplement use and deficient dietary intakes for the 8 nutrients examined.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study examined risky sexual behavior, psychosocial variables, and drug risk behavior in a multiethnic sample of male partners of HIV-positive women. The sample included 30 African American men (10 HIV positive and 20 HIV negative) and 22 European American men (7 HIV positive and 15 HIV negative). Results indicated a moderate to high rate of sexual risk taking in these men, despite the possible risks for infection or reinfection. This was especially true for the HIV-positive men of both ethnic groups. Low-income, HIV-positive European American men engaged in more risk taking than the other groups. Despite being in an intimate relationship with an HIV-positive partner, most of the HIV-positive European American men and HIV-negative African American men were fairly optimistic about their relative risk of infection/reinfection. The implications of these results for future research and for the design of interventions for persons living with an HIV-positive partner are discussed.

The study extends the literature by testing this mediational model with a low-income, predominantly ethnic minority sample of preadolescent children and by examining the effects of multiple dimensions of interparental conflict from the child's perspective. Results supported the mediational model when analyses were based on child's reports of all variables but not when mother's reports were used to assess child depression and conduct problems. Exploratory analyses revealed unique mediational paths associated with conflict frequency and resolution, which were examined along with intensity as distinct dimensions of interparental conflict.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"A practice-based cross-sectional survey was carried out of the prescribing of antidepressants and anxiolytics (daily defined dosages) in 164 general practices. The study was set in East London and the City Health Authority, which includes the multiethnic inner London. The main outcome measures were the annual prescribing rates for each group of drugs, calculated as the total annual daily defined dosages divided by the practice population, and the ratio of antidepressant/anxiolytic annual prescribing rates. Prescribing rates for antidepressants showed a 25-fold variation between practices; this was greater for anxiolytics. The median annual prescribing rate for all antidepressants combined was 4.13. For all anxiolytics and hypnotics combined the median annual prescribing rate was 3.55. Univariate analysis showed that Asian ethnicity alone accounted for 28% of the variation in antidepressant prescribing and 20.5% of the variation in the anxiolytic prescribing. A backwards multiple regression model using 10 explanatory practice and population variables accounted for 47.7% of the variance in antidepressant prescribing and 34% of the variance in the anxiolytic prescribing.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Using data from 5,870 8th-grade adolescents in California, this study examined ethnic differences in the association between peer influence variables and smoking behavior and susceptibility. Informational peer influence (best friends' smoking behavior) and normative peer influence (prevalence estimates of peer smoking) were investigated. We hypothesized that informational peer influences would be stronger among Whites than among Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and African Americans. Conversely, we hypothesized that normative peer influences would be stronger among ethnic minority adolescents from collectivist cultural backgrounds than among Whites. Consistent with previous studies, friends' smoking and prevalence estimates of peer smoking were risk factors for past 30-day smoking and susceptibility to smoking across ethnic groups. The influence of friends' smoking behavior was stronger among Whites than among several other groups: Pacific Islanders, African Americans, and Hispanic/Latinos. The influence of prevalence estimates of peer smoking was stronger among Whites than among multiethnic adolescents. Results indicate that cultural factors may play a role in peer influences on smoking initiation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Describes formative research used to help develop the SunSmart skin cancer prevention program in Hawaii. Group discussions and interviews were conducted with 216 children in grades 1, 2, and 3; 15 parents; and 27 recreation staff. Children's discussion groups took place in intact classrooms. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used. Multiple raters and an iterative process were used to analyze data from survey forms, observer impressions and audio tapes, and to draw the main conclusions. Sun protection practices all groups were inconsistent, though general awareness about prevention was widespread. Children reported a reluctance to cover up with long pants and sleeves, and wide-brim hats, and did not understand what skin cancer was. Parents and recreation staff were supportive of education and policy supports, to improve both their own and the children's prevention habit.

Sixty videotapes representing 28 male and 12 female second and third-year residents interviewing a range of multiethnic patients, 63% of whom were female, over a 2-year period at a community clinic were analysed for evidence of family-oriented communications, as well as other interaction behaviours such as information exchange and partnership building. Inter-rater agreement was 78%. Asking for medical information, clarifying patient information, and giving medical information and explanations were the most common types of resident actions. Family orientation was much less common, but was more frequently observed than the eliciting of a patient-centered agenda or suggestion of a psychosocial intervention or referral. Family orientation was associated with longer interviews, non- interpreted interviews, more physician questions and clarifying behaviours, and greater tendency to elicit the patient's agenda. Findings of this investigation suggest that family orientation in the medical interview is enhanced by having more time and a shared language, as well as a generally probing, clarifying, patient-centered style on the part of the physician.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article focuses on the ethnic identity of children in Belize. Belizean nationalism, as taught in the primary schools, is both pan-ethnic and multiethnic. However, because the increasingly widespread practice of ethnic mixing is unacknowledged, there is a discrepancy between what is taught in school and the daily life of children.The overt intent is to recognize and celebrate difference; however, the result has been to silence children's voices. Children, primarily between ages 7 and 11, and teachers were interviewed concerning ethnic identity over 2 school years. Tests, drawings, and papers in which notions of ethnicity were a part were collected. Classes were observed everyday. Teachers reported that 68 out of 230 were of mixed ethnicity. In day-to-day circumstances of school, teachers did not label children by more than 1 ethnic group. 58 out of 68 of the ethnically mixed Ss were interviewed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The life story of the internationally adopted child tends to be an emotional one. How the story is told and retold in the family can have lasting consequences for the child's adjustment and well-being. In telling the story, parents are faced with a unique challenge: To what extent is it desirable to encourage their children, who already struggle with identity issues related to adoption, to identify with their cultures of origin? Therapists working on these issues with multiethnic adoptive families can find little guidance in the family systems literature. To fill this gap, the present article reviews the literature on racial/ethnic identity development and the available research on ethnic identification, self-esteem, and the psychological adjustment of cross-ethnically adopted children and adolescents. Implications for practice include developmental considerations, identifying children and families at risk, and recommendations for those in need of intervention.

This study uses fixed response and textual data obtained through in-depth interviews with adults 70 years and older from a multiethnic population in rural North Carolina to examine the incidence of food insecurity and how older adults experience food insecurity and maintain food security. The authors interviewed 145 elders up to five times over the course of one year. Responses to standard food insecurity questions indicate that only 12% of older adults experience food insecurity. However, analysis of textual data reveals common themes concerning food insecurity that suggest that these questions may underestimate the number of rural elders who are food insecure and not tap the potential vulnerability of others who are dependent on precarious nutritional self-management strategies to meet their needs.

The concept of ethnic identity captures the incorporation of ethnicity into self-perception, providing a pivotal link to the social psychological consequences of minority status. A more generalizable psychometric examination of an instrument used extensively in research on African American youth to capture this phenomenon is warranted. This investigation sought to identify revisions of the MEIM that would render it more useful for interethnic and intraethnic comparisons, utilizing a sample more heterogeneous and representative than those of prior studies. Item and exploratory factor analyses indicate that 10 of 14 items can be combined into a short form (MEIM-S) that measures aspects of this phenomenon that are comparable across ethnic groups, and identify two factors. In general, Whites score significantly lower than African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos, whose scores tend to be similar to one another consistent with the literature on interethnic variation in the salience of ethnic identity.

The psychometric properties and mean differences on the MEIM for White, monoracial minority, and multiracial early adolescents were investigated. Principal components and multigroup confirmatory factor analysis were used to explore and confirm the factor structure of the MEIM items. Two factors were identified: (1) identification and (2) exploration. Identification was represented by items that reflect a sense of belonging and pride in an individual's ethnic group. Exploration was represented by items that characterize a search for ethnic group identity and participation in ethnic practices. Results show reliabilities for the 2 subscales were alpha = .84 for identification and alpha = .76 for exploration. Also, the results indicate that most individuals from monoracial minority groups and multiracial subgroups scored similarly on overall ethnic identity.

The authors compared the motivation and learning environment of 60 resilient and 60 nonresilient Latino middle school students from a multiethnic metropolitan city located in the south central region of the United States. The multivariate analysis and univariate post hoc tests revealed that resilient students had significantly higher perceptions of involvement, satisfaction, academic self-concept, and achievement motivation than nonresilient students. The discriminant function analysis revealed that the variables of academic aspirations, involvement, academic self-concept, expectations for high school graduation, not being held back in school, and satisfaction were related most highly to the overall discriminant function. Results are discussed in relation to previous work on educational resilience and to implications for improving the education of students at risk of failure.

The multiethnic samples consisted of 286 female college students (aged 18-21 yrs) and 101 female HIV seronegative injecting drug users (aged 18-45 yrs). Secondary analysis of 2 data sets was conducted for this comparative descriptive study. The results show that approximately 90% of college students and 60.4% of injecting drug users appraised their HIV risk as nil or small. Injecting drug users were 3.1 times more likely than college students to perceive some risk of HIV infection and 28.8 times more likely to perceive a large or great risk. Both samples minimized their HIV risk. It is concluded that HIV risk perception appears to be based on cognitive antecedents in addition to risky HIV-related sexual and drug-use behavior. It is theorized that both samples used the cognitive coping strategies of denial, distancing, and downward comparison to minimize their HIV risk perception.

Results show that clinicians' definitions fall along a continuum with four overlapping dimensions that emphasize (a) being aware of the existence of differences, (b) having knowledge of the client's culture, (c) distinguishing between culture and pathology in assessment, and (d) taking culture into account in therapy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Used microanalysis to identify active, discriminating components of global parent interview variables previously shown to differentiate stress-resilient (SR) and stress-affected (SA) outcomes in independent samples (4th-6th and 2nd-3rd grade) of 306 multiethnic, highly stressed, urban children. The in-depth interview assessed caregiving environment and early child development. On item-level t tests for the pooled sample, 36 of 144 items differentiated the groups. Discriminant function analysis identified a cluster of 9 sensitive items that correctly classified 81.7% of children as SR or SA. Factor analysis of the 36 items identified a 4-factor solution: Child Adjustment, Early Temperament, Parent-Child Relationship, and Developmental Milestones; SR parents exceeded SAs on each. Structurally comparable analyses using only Sample 2 and including the second interview's new measures, replicated and extended findings from the pooled sample. Overall, study findings enhance understanding of resilience and testify to the merit of using a microanalytic approach in this research area. Implications for streamlining existing measures and for future research directions are considered.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the association between psychological distress and menopause among African-American, White, Chinese, Hispanic, and Japanese females. 10,374 females (aged 40-55 yrs) completed surveys concerning: (1) menstrual regularity in the previous year; (2) psychosocial factors; (3) health; (4) somatic-psychological symptoms; and (5) psychological distress, which was defined as feeling tense, depressed, and irritable in the previous 2 wks. Ss were classified as experiencing natural premenopause, perimenopause, or postmenopause. Results show that rates of psychological distress were highest in early perimenopause Ss and lowest in premenopause and postmenopause Ss. In comparison with premenopausal Ss, early perimenopausal Ss were at a greater risk of distress, even after controlling for vasomotor and sleep symptoms. Odds of distress were significantly higher for Whites than for the other Ss. It is concluded that psychological distress is associated with irregular menses in midlife.

The author examined ethnic identity development as a process that occurs simultaneously with the development of ego identity and attitudes toward groups other than one's own. A multiethnic sample of 297 adolescents and young adults (aged 13-26 yrs) completed the Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Scale Revision 2, the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure, and the Other Group Orientation Scale. An Age x Ethnic Group x Gender experimental design was used to determine whether these factors contributed differently to ethnic identity and ego identity. Analyses showed significant differences in the level of ethnic identity development among the ethnic groups. More pronounced age differences were found at the lower levels of ego identity development than at the more advanced levels.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined mothers' perceptions of breastfeeding information and support received from hospital- and community-based health professionals. 108 first-time breastfeeding mothers (aged 17-42 yrs) residing within a multiethnic Canadian community completed questionnaires 3 wks postpartum concerning impressions of breastfeeding support received from hospitals and community health services, the degree to which recommended practices in support of breastfeeding were followed during their hospital stay, and perceptions of the types and sources of breastfeeding information. Results show that approximately two-thirds of subjects (Ss) were born outside of Canada. Immigrant Ss were more likely to report that their breastfeeding infant was given supplemental water or formula during their hospital stay and that they were provided with formula samples upon discharge. Immigrant Ss were more likely to receive breastfeeding help by community-care staff.

This article addresses this gap by examining racial and ethnic inequality in homeownership and housing equity among the preretirement population (aged 51-61 yrs) in the US. Results support a stratification perspective of inequality for both Blacks and Hispanics; even after accounting for numerous life-cycle, resource, and social-psychological considerations, Blacks and Hispanics continue to lag significantly behind Whites in housing wealth. While Hispanics initially appear better off than Blacks with respect to housing, this is largely a function of their more favorable family structure. Important differences between blacks and Hispanics in the main contributors to housing inequality highlight the need to take a more multiethnic perspective on wealth stratification.

The sample consisted of 92 occupational therapy undergraduate students whose ages ranged from 21-52. Thirty-six percent identified themselves as Hispanic, Asian, Filipino, Asian-Indian, African-American, or multiethnic. Literature was reviewed concerning education, clinical training, self-efficacy, and developmental models of supervision. The educational module consisting of education and self-management strategies regarding trainees' hypothesized developmental cognitive and affective stages was given to 48 students 3 weeks prior to the practicum experience. It was hypothesized that when compared with a similar control group, the experimental group would receive: (a) lower scores in anxiety at the middle and ending periods of the practicum, as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Spielberger, 1983); (b) higher scores in self-esteem at the middle and ending periods of the practicum as measured by the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI) (Coopersmith, 1981); and (c) higher scores in performance at the end of the practicum, as measured by the Occupational Therapy Final practicum. Competency Evaluation (FPCE) (San Jose State University). In addition, prepracticum strength of self-efficacy was hypothesized to predict lower anxiety and higher practicum performance. Analysis of variance and multiple regression were used to analyze the data. The results did not support the main hypotheses; there were no significant group differences in self-esteem, anxiety, self-efficacy, or performance. Both groups showed nonsignificant trends toward increasing self-esteem and decreasing anxiety during the practicum. Self-esteem was inversely, significantly related to state and trait anxiety prior to and at the ending periods of the practicum. Self-efficacy was inversely, significantly related to trait anxiety prior to, at the middle, and ending periods, but was inversely, significantly related to state anxiety only at the end of the practicum. Implications are presented regarding the relationship of self-esteem, anxiety, and self-efficacy in beginning practicum students.

A total of 66 White boys and girls from mostly-White and racially and ethnically mixed, middle-class, Catholic schools completed questionnaires, chose among photographs via computer, and took pail in an interview. Children's television viewing frequency, television familiarity, perceived reality of general television, perceived reality of African Americans on television, schematicity, schemas for African Americans in real life or on television, and level of cross-race interaction were assessed. Results showed that children thought about African Americans on television and in real life in ways that were different from the ways in which social scientists and television critics have thought about them. Children's schemas for African Americans were composed primarily of character traits and of comparisons of African Americans to others or to themselves, and were less tv-like than was expected. Children spoke about African Americans in mostly positive ways, and even when their descriptions included stereotypes or attitudes that were negative, they also often included ideas that were ""redeeming."" There was little support for the idea that children's schemas for African Americans on television and for African Americans in real life would be different from each other. There was little support for the notion that level of cross-race experience, amount of high- and regular-quality television viewing, and perceived realism of television and of African Americans on television would be associated with the stereotypedness of children's schemas for African Americans. There was no support for the notion that children for whom race was an important dimension in decision making had more developed schemas than children for whom race was not an important dimension in decision making. That this study was conducted in the highly multiethnic, multiracial city of Los Angeles might have influenced the results. It would be important to study further the effects of television's limited range of and mostly stereotyped portrayals of African Americans on children's schemas, perhaps in a location which is less ethnically and racially mixed.

In recent years, a reasonable number of studies have documented substantive relationships between students' epistemological beliefs and learning. The underlying assumption in epistemological belief studies is that individuals with more sophisticated epistemological beliefs may have different learning and problem solving behaviors from those with less sophisticated beliefs. While the influence of epistemological beliefs on learning behaviors has been identified, few studies have explored cultural variability in epistemological beliefs. Using independent and interdependent self-construals (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) as cultural indicators and a five-factor epistemic model delineated by Schommer (1990), this study examined how culturally conditioned self-construals affected epistemological beliefs. A multiethnic sample of 692 undergraduate and graduate students in the United States participated in this study. Through a series of confirmatory factor analyses, the originally hypothesized five-factor model was reduced to a four-factor model. A structural equation model subsequently identified that all of the four epistemological belief factors are significantly and positively affected by ""educational level,"" and are significantly and negatively influenced by ""interdependent self-construal."" ""Independent self-construal"" was observed to have significant and positive effects on epistemological factors, ""certainty of knowledge"" and ""omniscient authority."" These results suggest that the particular kinds of epistemological beliefs valued in American schools may be biased in favor of students with Western cultural backgrounds and against students with non-Western cultural backgrounds such as East Asian Americans.

Two general questions guiding the study included: (1) How do multiethnic women experience romantic relationships and the process of partner selection? and (2) how have race/ethnicity and identity development affected their romantic relationships and the choices they make concerning partner selection? Twelve multiethnic women participated in this study. Participants were diverse with regard to age, race, ethnicity, income level, education, and religious affiliation. Each woman participated in an in-depth, semistructured interview, as well as a shorter followup interview for purposes of clarification and confirmation. Six participants attended an optional focus group that lasted approximately 3 hours, and 5 participants provided documentary evidence such as letters, journals, and pictures. Data were analyzed using the grounded-theory method developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967). Results yielded the Metisse Model. The overarching theme that emerged from the data was Incongruent Internal and External Perceptions. Participants described their experiences with dissonant perceptions related to identity and romantic relationships. Incongruent perceptions affected all stages of ethnic identity development and experiences in romantic relationships. Within the overarching theme of Incongruent Internal and External Perceptions, two main categories emerged: Stages in the Process of Identity Development and Romantic Relationships in a Developmental Context. An affirmative, developmental model emerged and included 5 stages of multiethnic identity development: External Focus, Marginality, Exploration, Misperceived, and Internal Sense of Self. As participants experienced changes in their ethnic identity, they also experienced changes in their romantic relationships. Along with romantic relationship experiences that paralleled stages in ethnic identity development, participants reported a desire for their romantic partners to see them as they saw themselves, complex multiethnic women. Some participants also expressed a desire to be with partners who provided clues to others that allowed greater congruence between internal and external perceptions. However, participants agreed that partners who provided understanding and acceptance of their multiethnic heritages were more important than partners who allowed increased congruence.

A heterogeneous multiethnic sample of 40 adult marathoners was interviewed with a seven item questionnaire. Subject responses were organized into Novice, Basic, Advanced, Champion, and National levels of marathon expertise in an effort to illuminate intra sample variations in the data. General themes related to marathon experiences, motives, and meanings among the five groups were generated and intragroup comparisons were discussed. The hypothesis that subjects would confirm interactive physical, emotional, and mental elements of fatigue during the marathon was validated. The hypothesis that over 50% of subjects would report personal experience or familiarity with ""The Wall"" as a discrete phenomenon within the marathon experience was also confirmed. The hypothesis that initial motives which impelled marathon training and participation would change during the course of the race was not confirmed. Instead, results indicated that underlying motives primarily related to mastery, competition, and social recognition remained operational. What changed under multidimensional duress were personal goals. Typically, various levels of perceived fatigue caused competitors to lower their personal goals as measured in finishing time, place, or percentile rank. The hypothesis that some competitors would encounter debilitating fatigue so intense that their motivation was to simply ""survive"" the marathon was also confirmed. Finally, the hypothesis that the marathon could be conceptualized as an arena which allows man to struggle with various changing levels of physical, psychological, and interpersonal needs was also confirmed by relating motives and experiences of marathoners to Maslow's theory of motivation. In summary, this effort provides a significant contribution to the field of sport psychology by providing qualitative insights regarding the intragroup variations of marathon experiences, motives, and meanings as a function of five levels of marathon expertise.

With the hope of facilitating successful program development and reducing the number of adolescents who experience emotional and behavioral dysfunction, an increasing number of researchers have examined the risk and protective factors related to adolescent development and adjustment. In line with such research, this study examined two factors, perceived parent support and homogeneity of adolescent and perceived parent ethnic identification, and their association with adolescent psychological adjustment. The data used for this study were obtained as part of a longitudinal investigation conducted by the Tri-Ethnic Center. In 1995 and 1996, data were collected from high school students attending school districts in the southwestern U.S., one in an urban city (population = 500,000) and the other in a mid-sized city (population = 100,000). A total of 75 Mexican-American/Spanish students, 114 White-American/Anglo students, and 27 Multiethnic Mexican-American/Spanish and White-American/Anglo students aged 15 to 18 were included in this study. Findings indicated that perceived parent support was associated with the following psychological adjustment measures: Depression, Anger, Blame, Global Self-Esteem, and Social Self-Esteem. Adolescents who reported low perceived parent support indicated more depression than adolescents who reported medium low, medium high, or high perceived parent support. The same pattern was evident for the psychological adjustment scales measuring anger and blame. Other group differences were found in reports of feelings of anger and blame. Adolescents who indicated medium high perceived parent support reported more anger than adolescents who perceived high levels of parent support. Adolescents who reported medium low perceived parent support indicated more blame than adolescents who reported high perceived parent support. With respect to global self-esteem and social self-esteem, adolescents who perceived low parent support indicated lower global self-esteem and lower social self-esteem than adolescents who perceived medium low, medium high, or high parent support. In a secondary analysis, it was found that males reported more anxiety than did females. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

Chief goals were to examine whether aspects of family narrative could distinguish ADHD from comparison girls and whether family narrative interactions could predict social competence generally, and in ADHD and comparison girls separately. Additionally, it was sought to link narrative process with developmental outcome to contribute to the validity of the Family Narrative Consortium's (FNC) assessment tool (Fiese et al., 1999). Three aspects of family Narrative Interaction were examined (Style, Coordination, and Confirmation) and peer social preference. Family narratives were videotaped for both positive and negative retellings of past events. Peer sociometric variables were obtained during a naturalistic research summer camp program. ADHD families were found to qualitatively differ from comparison families in Style and Coordination, At the individual, co-narrator level, both mothers and fathers of ADHD girls were significantly less likely to Confirm their child's contributions than were mothers and fathers in the comparison group. ADHD girls were not significantly more likely than comparison girls to disconfirm their parent's narrative contributions, but borderline significance was achieved. Overall, findings were more salient in the retelling of a negative event. This pattern held even when co-varying for the child's verbal skill. Of particular interest was the finding of a significant two-way interaction between group and type of narrative (positive vs. negative) for maternal Confirmation. When faced with the challenge of retelling a negative event, mothers of ADHD girls evidenced greater disconfirmation than they had in the retelling of a positive narrative, while mothers of comparison girls were as confirming as they had been in the positive narrative. Although not statistically significant, similar patterns were evident in paternal Confirmation and child Confirmation. Family narrative variables of Coordination and Confirmation were also found to significantly relate to peer social preference, particularly for girls with ADHD. Relationships revealed between family Narrative Interaction and developmental outcome contributed to the validity of the FNCs narrative assessment tool. Results are discussed with regards to socialization theory and emotional regulation.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Recognizes that few nations are homogeneous and, as migration increases, ethnic diversity creates more opportunities for conflict within them along ethnic, racial, religious and linguistic divides (hereafter referred to collectively as ""communal"" differences). Thus, this chapter seeks a better understanding of the manner in which people are able to negotiate loyalty to their ethnic particularisms while adopting or retaining civic culture and loyalty demanded by the nation-state, and examines the relationship between ethnic and national identities within the US. The authors note that the ethos of American society treats communal conflict as aberrant, largely idiosyncratic individual choices. They argue that communal conflict is a manifestation of a systematic tendency for: (1) groups to form social identities around communal differences, (2) there to be an inverse relationship between the strength of communal and common identities, and (3) both material and symbolic differences between groups to become occasions for communal conflict in the US. The thesis underlying the analysis is that social diversity shapes social identities that provide material and symbolic reasons for communal conflict, and conflict is an unavoidable, systematic by-product of social diversity itself.

When and how do ethnic, religious, and national identities lead to oppression, violence, rebellion, mass murder, and genocide? How do intergroup conflicts change people's identities? How might social identity be harnessed in the service of reducing conflict between groups? To address these questions, social and behavioral scientists invited to present their perspectives at the Third Rutgers Symposium on Self and Social Identity, held April 1999, crafted their presentations into the chapters of this book. These chapters offer a sophisticated and detailed interdisciplinary analysis of the most fundamental issues involved in understanding social identity and conflict between groups.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the effects of partner interactions on ambulatory blood pressure in a sample of 120 healthy adults (aged 23-50 yrs) who were monitored over a 6-day period. After each blood pressure measurement, participants rated characteristics of ongoing social interactions, along with emotional activation, physical activity, talking, posture, and other covariates, with computer-assisted self-report assessments Using multilevel modeling, the authors showed that blood pressure was significantly lower during social interactions with one's partner relative to social interactions with any other person and relative to periods of not interacting. Interactions with partners also were characterized by significantly less talking and emotional activation and more intimacy and perceived emotional support; however, these differences did not mediate the partner effect on blood pressure. In addition, the relative benefits of interacting with a partner were not moderated by relationship quality, gender, or race. The effects of social situations on ambulatory blood pressure may represent one pathway through which social relationships affect cardiovascular health.

Dangriga was founded during the 19th century by members of an ethnic minority of West African and Native American heritage, known as the Garinagu or Garifuna. Today, it is a multilingual and multiethnic town populated primarily by Garinagu, Belizean Creoles, and both native-born and foreign-born Spanish speakers. In this context, language choice is in part a question of affiliation with a variety of ethnic and national identities. This article examines the manner in which ethnic and national stereotypes and images, as well as current demographic shifts in the Belizean population, affect language choice in multilingual contexts. Particular attention is paid to the position of young Garinagu vis-oa-vis the Garifuna language and Belizean English Creole.

Intervention research has addressed the issue of what works best, how it can be applied and sustained schoolwide, and how computer and information management technology can improve quality and reduce teachers' work loads. The net product of this research is the ClassWide Peer Tutoring Learning Management System (CWPT-LMS). In this article, the authors report on use of the CWPT-LMS in the literacy instruction of elementary-level ELL. Five ELL teachers and 117 students (1st-5th graders) in a multiracial/multiethnic urban elementary school, including students with disabilities, participated in the study. Results indicated that ELL made considerable progress in mastering the curriculum over periods ranging from 15 to 21 wks of school across teachers, teachers implemented CWPT to high standards of fidelity, students' and teachers' satisfaction with the CWPT program was high, and consultation improved program implementation and student outcomes of all but 1 classroom. Implications of these findings are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The current study investigated cross-cultural differences in ways of coping with sadness in a multicultural sample of 140 undergraduate students (aged 18-54 yrs). Ss completed the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (Folkman & Lazarus, 1988) and ethno-culture was divided into Asian, Caucasian, and Multiethnic categories. ANOVA analyses revealed that Asians and Caucasians are less likely to use confrontive and positive reappraisal coping strategies in dealing with sadness than multicultural individuals. Asians are also less likely to use distancing coping strategies than multicultural individuals. Clinical implications of the results are discussed.

The 4-question interview questionnaire was presented to a multiethnic sample of 511 18-64 yr old women at public and private specialty clinics, to determine the frequency, type, and perpetrator of abuse. Results show the instrument detected a 9.8% prevalence of abuse during the previous 12 mo. Using 2 standard physical and sexual assault questions, 7.8% of the women reported abuse. The 2 disability-related questions detected an additional 2.0% of the women as abused. Women defining themselves as other than Black, White, or Hispanic (i.e., Asian, mixed ethnic background) were more likely to report physical or sexual abuse or both, whereas disability-related abuse was reported almost exclusively by White women. The perpetrator of physical or sexual abuse was most likely to be an intimate partner. Disability-related abuse was attributed equally to an intimate partner, a care provider, or a health professional. It is concluded that both traditional abuse-focused questions and disability-specific questions are required to detect abuse toward women with physical disabilities.

Additional collected data included height and weight measurements. Results show that 5.8% of Ss were vegetarians. Vegetarian Ss were more likely than nonvegetarians to be female, not black, weight- and body-conscious, dissatisfied with their bodies, and involved in a variety of healthy and unhealthy weight control behaviors. Vegetarian Ss more often reported having been told by a physician that they had an eating disorder and were more likely to have contemplated and attempted suicide. Vegetarian males were found to be an especially high risk group for unhealthy weight control practices. Few ethnic group differences among vegetarians were noted. Adolescents who did not eat chicken and fish were at lower risk than those who also ate chicken and fish. It is concluded that adolescent vegetarians are at greater risk than others for involvement in unhealthy and extreme weight control behaviors.

Results show high percentages of suicide risk, with about 60% of Ss reporting some depression or suicide ideation and 22.6% of Ss classified as high risk. Higher levels of reported suicide risk were prominent among multiethnic, urban, and female Ss. Male and female Ss who perpetrated violence by initiating fights, threatening to use weapons, and using weapons to assault others were more likely to be classified in the high-risk suicide group than those who did not. Victims and those witnessing violence did not significantly differ overall. Those who were neither perpetrators nor victims were overrepresented in the low suicide risk classification, whereas Ss who were victims only, and those who were perpetrators and victims, were underrepresented in this classification.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the psychological impact of children's exposure to violence and the influence of mothers' knowledge about their children's encounters with violence. The sample consisted of a poor, multiethnic sample of 104 4th- or 5th-grade children and their mothers (mean age 36 yrs). Children in this sample were exposed to rather high levels of community violence, and on the whole, mothers greatly underestimated their children's exposure to violence and feelings of psychological distress. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that children's exposure to violence was associated with greater psychological distress. These findings suggest that the detrimental effects of community violence are present for all children, irrespective of their racial background. Further, greater mother-child agreement about children's exposure to violence was related to better psychological functioning. The implications of these results for effective parenting strategies and community-based interventions are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Although correlations between interparental conflict and child maladjustment are well-established, the processes connecting these 2 phenomena are less understood. The present study tested whether an aggressogenic cognitive style mediates the relationship between interparental conflict and child aggression. A multiethnic sample of 115 families with a child between the ages of 7 and 13 years participated. Questionnaires were used to assess parents' and children's perceptions of interparental conflict, children's social problem-solving strategies and beliefs about aggression, and parent and teacher reports of child aggression. Support was found for the mediating effect of aggressogenic cognitions on children's school aggression but not on children's aggression at home. Implications for understanding the associations among interparental conflict, children's social cognitions, and child aggression in different environmental contexts are discussed.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Examines achievement patterns of ethnic minority youth from a motivational perspective. The focus of the research is motivational processes in African American youth, although the author has broadened the perspective to include multiethnic samples who share some of the same motivational beliefs and school achievement patterns as their African American counterparts. In the present studies, participants were asked to nominate the classmates whom they most admired, respected, and wanted to be like, and whom they felt fit the the descriptions of trying hard and getting good grades, not trying hard and receiving poor grades, and following or not following school rules. Study 1 included about 300 African American 6th, 7th, and 8th graders from predominantly black schools. Study 2 included about 400 African American, Latino, and white 6th, 7th, and 8th graders from an ethnically diverse middle school. To get a developmental perspective on achievement valuing, Study 3 included 2nd-4th graders. Findings indicate that it would be inaccurate to conclude that ethnic minority students as a group devalue effort. Second, there are complex Ethnicity X Gender X Age interactions, particularly for adolescent minority males. Third, these findings have useful implications for intervention.

Using longitudinal data from a multiethnic community sample of 470 adults, the authors examine patterns of abuse and dependence on alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Men were significantly more abusive, dependent, and polysubstance dependent on all drugs than women. A large percentage of drug abusers, and over 1/3 with drug dependence, remitted without formal treatment. However, early severe problems with cocaine increased later alcohol problems. Traditional disease progression and drug use acquisition models are not supported. Psychologists should incorporate the natural course of substance use into treatment and prevention efforts.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Cultural factors influence how a person relates to others and, therefore, interactions with members of a group and with the leader of the group. In a multiethnic society, it is natural for therapy groups to be composed of members with widely varying backgrounds and widely varying values, beliefs, and attitudes. Thus, conducting culturally relevant and effective group therapy with multiethnic members is an exciting clinical challenge to the contemporary group therapist. This chapter considers the cultural values that influence group dynamics: mutuality vs. individualism, social role and hierarchy, and ethnic identity. Issues specific to multiethnic psychotherapy groups include symbolism and nonverbal communication, cultural transference, cultural countertransference, and ethnic prejudice. Several modifications of technique that have been found to be helpful in multiethnic, interpersonal group psychotherapy are suggested.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Describes 2 distinct processes that theoretically can produce psychological disengagement of self-esteem from academic performance: devaluing academic success and discounting the validity of academic outcomes. Previous research findings concerning ethnic differences in these processes of psychological disengagement are then discussed. The authors also present the results of a multiethnic study, involving 184 African Americans, 270 Latinos, and 222 European Americans (controls), in which they examined perceived ethnic injustice and academic performance as an antecedent of psychological disengagement processes among negatively stereotyped ethnic-minority college students. Specifically, the results indicate that African Americans' beliefs about ethnic justice (but not academic performance) predict greater discounting and devaluing. Further, Latinos' beliefs about ethnic injustice are associated with greater discounting, whereas poorer academic performance is associated with increased devaluing.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Reviews literature concerning clinical studies of pain in African Americans and Whites. The biopsychosocial model of pain maintains that the experience of pain is sculpted by interactions among biological, psychological, and social factors, the very factors that comprise ethnicity. Studies show greater sensitivity to experimental pain stimuli among African-Americans compared to Whites. Clinical studies of acute and persistent pain show higher levels among African-American patients compared to Whites. Ethnic factors influence how pain is appraised and responded to emotionally and behaviorally. It is concluded that clinical outcome studies involving multiethnic samples should probe for group differences in pain-related variables at baseline and in responses to treatment.

Archived data from the Hawaiian High Schools Health Survey were utilized in this study. An overall prevalence rate of 9.19% for generalized anxiety disorder, overanxious disorder, or social phobia was consistent with past studies. As hypothesized, STAI negatively worded items were better predictors than positively stated items. The STAI State mean was a better predictor of concurrent DISC anxiety disorders as compared to STAI State Factors 1 or 2. In contrast, the STAI Trait Factor 2 (negatively worded) composite was the best predictor for nonconcurrent DISC anxiety disorders as compared to STAI Trait Factor 1 or the overall STAI Trait subscale. Satisfactory predictive-validity values were obtained when using the STAI State mean and Trait Factor 2 composite. Implications of these findings are discussed, including using the STAI as a screening measure for ethnically diverse adolescents.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Compared the prevalence rates of major depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria with data from a multiethnic sample of adolescents drawn from a US-Japan study and investigated the relation of adolescent major depression to ethnicity. 2,046 adolescents (Anglo-Americans, African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and Japanese) aged 12-15 yrs were studied in 1994. The DSM Scale for Depression, a self-administered checklist developed from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children questions on major depression, was used to estimate the prevalence of DSM-IV major depression. The overall prevalence rates of major depression without/with impairment were 9.6% and 4.3% for Anglo-American, 13.4% and 6.1% for African-American, 16.9% and 9.0% for Mexican-American, and 5.6% and 1.3% for Japanese adolescents. The significant association between adolescent major depression and ethnicity disappeared after sociodemographic adjustments. Only fathers' educational attainment and family financial status remained significant. These findings imply ethnicity does not have a significant impact on the risk of adolescent major depression after sociodemographic adjustments.

Edited Book",,"(from the introduction) The essays selected for this volume speak directly to those kinds of debilitating assumptions that place not only basic writing students but also teachers of basic writing and the discipline itself on the margins of educational, economic, and political localities of influence. The collection is designed to present readers with previously published essays that together depict the fundamental and shifting theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical assumptions of basic writing instruction over the past two decades. Arranged roughly chronologically, the essays examine such issues as defining basic writers, the phenomenology of error, cognitivism and writing instruction, the social construction of remediation, and the politics of basic writing pedagogy in a postmodern world. That is, they collectively speak to what we perceive as some of the most enduring and important debates in the field of basic writing. At the same time they collectively illustrate that neither the basic writing classroom nor recent scholarship need be intellectually marginalized locations. By including in the collection primarily essays published between 1987 and 1997, the editors bring together essays that historicize the preceding decades of scholarship and also anticipate the future of the field.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) We developed the Family Coding System (G. Margolin and E. B. Gordis, 1992) as part of a larger project examining the effects of marital conflict on children. We developed this system to capture triadic family interactions involving mother, father, and child during a discussion about a behavior of the child's that is of concern to the parents and about which the parents experience some disagreement with each other. The task thus has the potential to evoke two types of conflict, that between parents and between parents and child. The discussion occurs while the family eats a snack, simulating a family meal. We have used the task and coding system with a multiethnic sample of two-parent families with male and female children aged 9-13 yrs.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The purpose of the System for Coding Interactions and Family Functioning (SCIFF) is to behaviorally assess family functioning across multiple ethnic groups, integrating both family systems and social learning perspectives. Originally developed for a multiethnic study of externalizing behaviors in school-age boys, the SCIFF assesses universal aspects of family functioning and is applicable with a wide range of populations. It has been found to be reliable with one- and two-parent families, as well as with a variety of ethnic groups, including Euro-American, Hispanic-American, and African-American families. The SCIFF was designed to code family problem discussions but also has been used successfully to code family play interactions.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Palestinian Citizens in an Ethnic Jewish State: Identities in Conflict by Nadim M. Rouhana (1997). This book demonstrates that Israel is an exemplary case for studying the contradictions of ethnic power and democracy. In addition to contributing to scholarship on Israel, Rouhana redresses a lacuna in social identity theory: the social psychology of collective identity of ethnic groups in multiethnic states. The rift between Jews and Palestinians in Israel is also evident in discrepant interpretations of local and regional events and developments relating to the conflict. Rouhana provides a fascinating discussion of this rift through his analysis of Jews' and Palestinians' responses to actual and hypothetical scenarios. Rouhana tends to minimize the myriad differences in collective identities among Palestinians. Dealing with such complications would have enriched this book. Nevertheless, Rouhana's study merits the attention of anyone interested in the social psychology of collective identity and of everyone seeking a better understanding of Israel.

The reviewer notes that this book (see record 1997-36901-000) is based on a study of 55 adolescents in four desegregated high schools in two urban school districts in California. The research was designed (a) theoretically, to highlight the adolescents' views as these can be verbalized to researchers; (b) rhetorically, to report these views through summarized narratives; and (c) methodologically, to ensure that the greatest amount of variability within the sample was attained. The potential value of the book, and its originality, lies in the drawing of the six personal management types derived from the dual emphases on qualities and strategies. The reviewer concludes that teachers and others interested in schools, particularly those being trained, should find this book most profitable in that it provides an accessible account of matters they will surely encounter.

These women were from a variety of ethnic, cultural, and economic backgrounds. The majority of the women were abused by nonfamily members (neighbors, acquaintances, friends of the family), but strangers were the identified perpetrators in 21% of the cases. In the intrafamilial sexual abuse cases, the perpetrator was most commonly a cousin. The majority of the sexual abuse consisted of fondling of the victim by the perpetrator (67%), with the second most reported experience being the exposure of the perpetrator to the victim (30%). There were differences in the economic backgrounds of the abused women when compared to the nonabused women, with the present findings differing from past research examining family of origin income level and sexual abuse. The importance of these findings is discussed as well as directions for future research.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Proposes a method of testing and refining inferred cultural models of identity in cognitive and psychological anthropology text analysis. It is noted that the task of inferring cultural models from lengthy texts or transcripts of intensive interviews is highly dependent on the representativeness of the sample of consultants, the researcher's command of the language, and his or her ability to detect themes through iterative analysis. Use of scenarios and systematic interviewing is recommended to verify and refine those inferred themes, schema, or cultural models. Scenarios are defined as brief narratives derived from observed or reported events. A set of scenarios can be used to elicit judgments concerning key themes of inferred cultural models. This technique is illustrated with a battery of 21 scenarios used, along with consensus analysis, to describe identity profiles for samples from Wales, Scotland, and Northeast England. Scenarios can be used to document claimed identity (what we are like) and attributed identity (what group X is like) and to discover similarities and differences across ethnic or national group boundaries.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Conducted a longitudinal study of the average long-term effects of informal literacy education at home on the development of reading skill, especially reading comprehension, in a socioeconomically varied and multiethnic sample in the Netherlands. The parents of 64 4-9 yr old preschool and school-age children were interviewed, and parent-child interactions were assessed 3 times. Oral language comprehension was measured at age 4 yrs in the 1st yr of kindergarten (1st grade in Dutch primary schools) and again at age 7 yrs in 3rd grade. Technical reading and reading comprehension were assessed at ages 7 yrs and 9 yrs in Grades 3 and 5. Reading activity, play activity, and problem-solving activity in the family were assessed. The results indicate that home literacy education had average long-term effects (probably mediated by earlier oral language development) on reading comprehension but only short-term effects on technical reading. The findings show that Ss' primary schools were more effective in teaching technical reading than in teaching reading comprehension.

It was hoped that a clearer vision of how African American men define success and the content of African American men's ethnic identity would be revealed. An ecological developmental perspective was used to achieve these goals. A sample of nine men completed ethnic identity and racism questionnaires and then participated in extensive semi-structured interviews. Two types of ethnic identities emerged from the study, ethnic solidarity and multiethnic solidarity. Both types involved a strong pride in the African American community, but the ethnic solidarity group placed the livelihood of that community over the livelihood of society as a whole. The multiethnic solidarity group, meanwhile, accepted all groups, regardless of ethnicity, and did not place the survival of one group over another. Success appeared to coincide with ethnic identity type, with individualistic goals coinciding with multiethinic solidarity and more communalistic goals coinciding with ethnic solidarity. An ecological model was formed from the data, which took into account how the various layers of society can influence ethnic identity development and how a person defines success.

Specifically, the present study established norms for the adolescent population for the Student Social Support Scale (SSSS; Nolten, 1994). The SSSS has proven to be a sound instrument in measuring children's perceptions of social support, with high levels of reliability and validity. The SSSS measures emotional, informational, appraisal, and instrumental forms of support provided by parents, teachers, close friends, and classmates. Additionally, an exploration of possible ethnic and gender differences was conducted. The research participants of this study consisted of a multiethnic sample of 191 ninth-, tenth-, eleventh-, and twelfth-grade students from four high schools (public and private) in the Chicagoland area. Overall, the preliminary analyses suggested that the SSSS is a valid and reliable measure of perceived social support with a multiethnic sample of adolescents. The results indicate that females consistently reported higher levels of perceived social support across the Total Scale, and Classmate and Close Friend subscales. Conversely, the male subjects consistently reported higher average levels of perceived support on the Parent and Teacher subscales. However, the only statistically significant result was that females perceived higher levels of social support from their Close Friends. With regard to the factor structure of the SSSS (Nolten, 1994), the exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor solution (parent, teacher, close friend, classmate). However, the confirmatory factor analysis was unable to confirm such a model. Additionally, the role of ethnicity in social support was inconclusive. That is, statistically, ethnic differences were observed between the five ethnic groups (Caucasian, Latino, African-American, Mixed Ethnicity, and Asian) on the Parent and Teacher subscales. However, due to the fact that the ethnic groups were of unequal size, post hoc analyses, to determine which specific groups differed on these subscales, could not be utilized. Further, Classmate support ratings consistently accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in self-image, social, academic, and total self-concept ratings. Finally, additional analyses indicated that there was not a statistically significant difference between the respondents' age/grade and how they perceived social support from the various sources. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed in the final chapter of this dissertation, and recommendations for social support researchers are provided.

In light of recent concern over school safety and the prevalence of violence and victimization among youth, it is important to identify risk factors for aggression and violent behaviors in students. Among these concerns are the prevalences of physical fighting and weapon-carrying among young adolescents. Aggressive behavior is positively correlated to problem behaviors such as alcohol use, drug use, and risky sexual behavior. This study investigated fighting, weapon-carrying, and aggressive tendencies in a cross-sectional sample of multiethnic middle school students. The aim of this study was to build a predictive model of risk factors for engaging in aggressive and violent behaviors as well as to estimate the prevalence of such behavior in a middle-school sample. Descriptive analyses estimated that the 30-day prevalence of physical fighting was nearly 30%, and was significantly higher for boys than for girls. Carrying a weapon to school was rare in this sample (less than 1%). Logistic regression analyses indicated that the risk factors associated with weapon carrying and physical fighting were different. For example, acts of vandalism were associated with higher odds of carrying a weapon to school but not fighting. These aggressive acts were positively correlated with self-reports of substance use and delinquency; and, when all of the risk behaviors were examined together in a confirmatory factor analysis, a single-factor model fit the data best. This study supports the generally held concept that many risk behaviors are positively associated with each other. Further, it indicates that aggressive acts are present in the schools and of such frequency as to be of concern. However, the binomial logistic models suggest that, while they are highly associated, there appear to be important differences between fighting and weapon carrying behaviors. A longitudinal study is proposed to examine issues of causality and further distinguish the sets of behaviors. Implications for prevention are discussed.

The social behavior of those high in self-monitoring seems to be guided by situational factors, whereas that of those low in self-monitoring seems to be guided by their internal states. This study examined whether (a) participants' SM level would be predicted from their adult attachment style (Collins & Read, 1990) and whether (b) participants' SM level would predict their levels of reactance, dating confidence, and specific sexual behaviors. Participants were a multiethnic, community sample of adolescents and young adults (mean age = 17.4). For the entire group of participants, the adult attachment dimension of Close predicted SM level. When the data were separated by gender, however, this relationships was found to be true only for men; whereas for women, Anxious attachment predicted SM levels, but in a negative direction. That is, mates who are able to feel close to others bad higher SM scores and females. who have lower Anxiety scores tended to score higher in SM. SM level predicted reported frequency of sexual intercourse per month. However, SM did not predict dating confidence, number of steady relationships, number of sexual partners, or age at first intercourse. Women scored higher than men in SM, which is contrary to the findings of previous researchers. Consistent with previous research, though, men reported having had more sexual partners, more steady relationships, and having been younger at first intercourse. Different patterns between-variable relationships were observed according to ethnic group. For African-American participants, age and ability to feel they could depend on others were predictors of SM style. For this group, HSM predicted higher dating confidence and higher frequency of sex per month. For the Euro-American group, higher SM predicted higher reactance. For the Latino group, which comprised the majority of the participants in this study, lower Anxiety scores predicted a higher SM style. For this group too, higher SM predicted higher reactance and higher dating confidence.

This study drew on the growing recognition by many researchers in the psychosocial development field of the need to target interventions at the interface of the development of identity and intimacy. The specific aim of the study was to address the question of whether it would be possible to develop intervention procedures for fostering identity and intimacy exploration and development. Using both qualitative and quantitative measurements, the results appeared to clearly support an affirmative answer to this question. A total of sixty-three middle adolescent students from an urban, public high school participated in this study. Twenty-nine participants in the treatment group and 34 participants in the comparison group were pre- and post tested on measures of identity and intimacy. Participants in this study consisted of multiethnic, urban youth that presented themselves for relationship counseling. Repeated measures analysis of variance's (RMANOVA's), used to evaluate the impact of the intervention on the quantitative measures of identity and intimacy exploration, clearly supported the efficacy of the intervention. In addition, the findings also provided tentative support for the view that the increase in exploration that results from entering a period of active exploration is associated with a ""loosening"" of commitment. Finally, the findings of this study also contributed to the empirical knowledge-base about procedures for intervening with respect to the process of intimacy development. More specifically, both the qualitative and quantitative findings of this study began to shed some light on the potential impact of exploration for interpersonal insight as that as a process for fostering intimacy development.

Its fine-grained approach sought to: (a) identify ""active"" items from global scales that optimally differentiated groups; and (b) recombine these items into factors that sensitively and parsimoniously predicted SR status. The study used two independent samples of highly stressed, inner city families: Sample 1, with 131 4th-6 th graders and their parents; and Sample 2, with 122 2nd-3rd graders and their parents. Interviews were conducted With each child's primary caregiver to assess caregiving environment and early child development. Analyses were conducted in two stages using: (a) the pooled Study 1 and 2 samples, and (b) only Sample 2, including relevant new Study 2 measures. Because the Study 2 interview included more measures, this latter step served both to replicate, and extend, the pooled analyses. In the pooled sample, t-tests showed that 36 of 144 items differentiated SRs and SAs and met inclusion criteria for subsequent analyses. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) identified a cluster of nine sensitive items that correctly classified 81.7% of children as SR or SA. A factor analysis of the 36 items identified a 4-factor solution: Child Adjustment, Early Temperament, Parent-Child Relationship, and Developmental Milestones. MANOVA-ANOVA analyses significantly favored SR over SA parents on all four factors. In Study 2, 57 of 146 items tested differentiated the groups. A DFA identified a set of five predictors that optimally differentiated the groups, correctly classifying 81.4% of children. Factor analysis of the 57 sensitive items identified a 6-factor solution: Caregiving Attitudes, Parent-Child Relationship, Parent Well-Being, Child Adjustment, Developmental Milestones, and Early Temperament . The Caregiving Attitudes and Parent Well-Being factors reflected items unique to the Study 2 interview. MANOVA-ANOVA analyses showed significant group differences favoring SR over SA parents on all six factors. Overall, study findings enhance understanding of child resilience and testify to the merit of using microanalytic approaches in resilience research.

The aims of this study are to characterize a study sample (N = 1496) of multiethnic convicted DWI offenders for comparison with other reports, and to determine the extent to which information gathered at screening is useful in predicting DWI recidivism, crashes and citations in a 4-year follow-up. Profile analysis was used to determine if Alcohol Use Inventory (AUI) and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) profiles differed among the racial/ethnic, gender, type of offender, and recidivism groups. A model was developed using logistic regression to determine which variables best discriminate between first-time offenders (FTOs) and multiple offenders at baseline (MOBs). A second model using logistic regression was developed to predict DWI recidivism from information gathered at screening. Results from the logistic regression were used in a probability formula to develop a table of predicted probability of recidivism. A model was developed using multiple regression to determine which variables best predict crashes and citations. The drinking drivers in this study were very similar in demographics to other DWI populations that have been described, though there were differences among the groups in terms of AUI and MMPI-2 profiles. The logistic regression to discriminate between FTOs and MOBs revealed that MOBs were more likely to be males, with less education, higher arrest BACs, and high scores on the receptive-awareness and MAC scales of the MMPI-2. Significant predictors of DWI recidivism were gender, age, arrest BACs, prior DWIs, and the MAC and receptive-awareness scales from the MMPI-2. Probability tables based on endorsement of low and high risk factors indicate that, as the number of risk factors endorsed increases, so does the probability of reoffending. For example, individuals with 1 risk factor have an 11% probability of reoffending, while those with 5 risk factors have a 53% probability of reoffending. The best predictors of involvement in a crash were age and high scores on the antisocial practices scale from the MMPI-2. The best predictors of future citations were age, gender, marital status, racial/ethnic group, prior citations, MAC score of the MMPI-2, and compliance with treatment.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Drawing from structured interviews with 154 mothers (aged 16-42 yrs) from an urban low-income multiethnic population in the United States, a typology of mothers' feelings about their infant feeding method was developed. Findings indicate that regardless of their feeding method, mothers tended to attribute higher health benefits to breastfeeding and perceived community norms as pro-breastfeeding. They differed in their rating and perceptions of logistics and the extent to which benefits mattered in their infant-feeding decision. Contradictions associated with the practice of breastfeeding even among mothers who breastfed, were reflected in their perceptions of social disapproval of breastfeeding in public, reports of ridicule by friends, lack of support from some health providers, and difficulties associated with working. A typology of mothers' emotional states resulting from such contradictions summarizes the findings and underscores how some mothers who did not, but would have liked to breastfeed, may be subjected to feelings of guilt and deprivation. Implications for educational interventions are to amplify prenatal infant feeding consultations and address ways to overcome logistical and apprehension barriers.

In addition, the relationship of discrimination-based distress to parental messages about race relationships and self-esteem was explored. The Adolescent Discrimination Distress Index along with measures of caregiver racial bias preparation and self-esteem was administered to 177 13-19 yr olds of different ethnic and racial backgrounds. Youth from all ethnic backgrounds reported distress associated with instances of perceived racial prejudice encountered in educational contexts. Instances of institutional discrimination in stores and by police were higher for older youth and particularly for African American and Hispanic teenagers. Encounters with peer discrimination were reported most frequently by Asian youth. Reports of racial bias preparation were associated with distress in response to institutional and educational discrimination and self-esteem scores were negatively correlated with distress caused by educational and peer discrimination. The importance of research on discrimination distress to understanding adolescent development in multiethnic ecologies is discussed here.

Ethnic representation included African American, Chinese, Filipino, other Asian/Pacific Islander, Latino, and European American. Over half of this sample of teens were sexually active by the age of 14, with sexually active teens and substance-abusing teens scoring higher on HIV knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding HIV-related behaviors. Ethnicity consistently appeared more significant in predicting these risk behaviors than gender, self-efficacy, and knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. The predominance of ethnicity as the predictor for these HIV risk behaviors indicates that theoretical models for behavior change must include a dimension of culture, diversity, and ethnic identity.

Hawaiian adolescents experienced significantly more adversity than their non-Hawaiian counterparts. The cumulative effect of family adversity had a greater effect on psychiatric symptomatology than any single indicator. Family support reduced the risk for internalizing symptoms, particularly for Hawaiian adolescents. The influence of family support was less clear for externalizing symptoms, increasing the risk for some adolescents and decreasing the risk for others.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article describes the 5-a-Day Power Plus program, which targeted multiethnic 4th- and 5th-grade students in 10 intervention and 10 control urban elementary schools in St Paul, Minnesota, to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. The intervention included behavioral curricula in classrooms, parental involvement, school food service changes, and food industry support. Process evaluation was conducted by using surveys and classroom and lunchroom observations to assess the characteristics of teachers and food service staff, the degree the intervention was implemented as intended, and external forces that may have affected the program results. Results showed high levels of participation, dose, and fidelity for all of the intervention components, with the exception of parental involvement. The process evaluation findings help explain why the increase in fruit and vegetable consumption occurred mostly at school lunch and not at home. It is suggested that future intervention research should focus on creating new and potent strategies for parental involvement and for increasing the appeal and availability of vegetables.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Victim Impact Panels (VIPs) have been implemented widely in the US by judges as a deterrent to drinking and driving, but there is little evidence of their utility in preventing recidivism. The objectives of this study were to examine judges' referral patterns to the VIPs among a multiethnic population of convicted 1st-time driving while impaired (DWI) offenders and to compare 5-yr recidivism rates of those mandated and not mandated to attend the VIP. Study participants included 5,238 convicted 1st-time DWI offenders (aged 16-30+ yrs) who were referred to a screening program and who completed a personal interview with a counselor between 1989 and 1995. Results showed that female judges were more likely than male judges to refer offenders to a VIP, and referral patterns varied by offender characteristics (sex, education, blood alcohol concentration, race/ethnicity, and marital status). The VIP referral did not increase rearrest rates but lowered them marginally to not at all. This study should be followed up with a randomized design to control for referral patterns and to further define the impact of mandating offenders to the VIP.

Results found that students who identified themselves as Canadian were significantly more likely to be current smokers than students reporting other ethnicities. There was no apparent increase in smoking rates for immigrants after two or more years in Canada. Current drinking, sexual activity, and especially friends, smoking was most strongly associated with current smoking for most ethnic groups, although the relative importance of these variables was not identical for all groups. It is concluded that prevention programs may benefit from a focus on the influence of peer smoking and on the grouping of lifestyle factors associated with smoking for students of all ethnic groups.

The questionnaires included information on demographics, risk factors, and smoking behavior and were administered in class. Results found that those lower in self-esteem and higher in social assertiveness appeared to be most at risk for the onset of smoking, whereas those low in optimism seemed to be the most at risk for the escalation of smoking. Attitudes, friends' norms, parents' norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived prevalence were consistent predictors of all smoking status outcomes. It is concluded that the behavioral-specific determinants of smoking appear to be important predictors of smoking status outcomes in all demographic subgroups, while the relationships of the global determinants were more dependent on the smoking outcome variable and subgroup examined.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Proposed a network theory in which members of a culture or group engage in similar behavior to the extent that particular situations activate a shared network of cognitive-affective mediating units (e.g., constructs, values, beliefs, goals, expectancies) within the group members. A study was conducted approximately a year following the conclusion of the O. J. Simpson criminal trial in which 113 Ss (aged 14-49 yrs) were asked to describe their reactions to the verdict. Ss wrote their responses in a free-form essay format, to enable the authors to detect the kinds of cognitions and affects that Ss spontaneously generated, as well as to examine the relations among cognitive-affective units (CAUs). Specifically, the authors investigated (1) the accessibility of a set of cognitive-affective mediating units, (2) the inter-connections between these units, and (3) the relationships between the accessible units and the people's agreement/disagreement with the verdict. The results show that in contrast to widely shared assumptions at the time, content analyses revealed that Ss' race did not have a direct effect on their reactions. Instead, differences in the accessibility of cognitive-affective units and their subsequent activation pathways characterized respondents' reactions.

Since there are values embedded in the text and illustrations of the books, children's literature teaches cultural values and exposes children to a perspective of the world. The purpose of this study was to explore the best-selling books for children and young adults in the United States from 1990 to 1997 in the categories of picture books and fiction. This study analyzed the values that are embedded in the language and themes of the books. The books that were chosen were based on predetermined criteria. The researcher used critical analysis to explore the language and the meanings of the text and relied upon the content of the text to suggest the themes for analysis. The study identifies four emerging themes that are analyzed: (1) Children need to feel in control of their lives-to be despondently independent; (2) True friendship and love is unconditional; (3) People feel more comfortable when others are like them which means differences are not tolerated; and (4) With every challenge there may not be a resolution, but there is hope in the future. The results of this study show that best-selling books for children and young adults reflect prosocial behaviors in the context of the mainstream culture in the United States. These behaviors might be considered antisocial in other cultures, such as how to confront obstacles or the value of individualism. Quantity of books sold is not synonymous with quality of books sold. Since adults are gatekeepers in some or all of the writing, publishing, and purchasing activities, the best-selling books expose children to the cultural values of the gatekeepers and result in an experience that may be based on an ethnocentric value system. Best-selling children's literature reflects who we are as a society. Through conscious decision-making in book buying, the purchaser can influence the quality of literature so that children will develop a multicultural perspective of the society in which they live.

This study builds upon the existing research by using assessments from multiple reporters, examining the influence of potential moderators, and focusing on young children. Drawing from a multiethnic, predominantly lower-income, metropolitan area, researchers conducted interviews with 95 children from grades K-2, their primary caregiver, and teachers. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that greater violence exposure was associated with more internalizing symptomatology, as reported by the youth and the teachers. Though violence exposure was not directly related to parent reports of child internalizing and externalizing symptoms regression analyses testing interactive effects revealed violence exposure was related to parental reports of child internalizing and externalizing behavior in a limited manner. Modeling analyses found little evidence of a relation between exposure and academic ability. Finally, a series of regressions found some evidence for the protective influence of competence, family cohesion, and family warmth for children exposed to violence. Results support the need for developing empirically-based early intervention programs aimed at minimizing the effects of chronic violence exposure.

Intake questionnaires comparing student and counselor assessments of 38 presenting concerns were analyzed. Data were analyzed utilizing Cohen's Kappa's, two-sample t tests, and ANOVA'a. Results indicated that there was an overall bias for counselors to ""under-pathologize"" all types of concerns, and that this bias was strongest for academic and career concerns. Both Hispanic and Japanese/Japanese American undergraduate students present with significantly more academic than personal concerns. Results also indicated that white counselors ""over-pathologized"" all students compared to all other ethnic minority counselors. The investigator concludes that white counselors operate from primarily an intra-psychic frame of reference, while minority counselors utilize a cultural frame of reference.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed clear differences in ethnic versus racial socialization. Analysis of open-ended items revealed clear differences in the content of both intragroup ""ethnic"" messages and intergroup ""racial"" messages across the four groups. Parental socialization of ethnic messages about intragroup issues was more prevalent than racial messages for African American, Latino and Asian American students. African American and white students more often reported receiving racial socialization messages about intergroup coping than either Latino or Asian students. The familial ecology, as measured by distal to proximal factors, had only a modest relationship to race related socialization among the African American sample. Implications from this study are drawn for future theory and research as well as family-centered intervention among African American and other ethnic and racial groups in an increasingly diverse multiethnic social ecology.

Social readjustment was measured using the Geriatric Social Readjustment Rating Scale (GSRRS). Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the GSRRS and its quartiles as well as stressful events subgroups, adjusting for education, hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes, and number of weekly visits as a measure of socialization. GSRRS scores ranged from 0 to 812; the mean score was 205.5 for patients and 206.2 for controls. No association was found in age, gender or race-ethnic subgroups, or when analyzing negative events, severely threatening events, or ongoing stressful illnesses separately. While this study does not preclude social readjustment as a stroke risk factor, it suggests that the one-time assessment often done in the medical office setting has little relevance for stroke prevention planning.

Outcome measures included ""ever"" and ""recent"" self-reported use of mammography, clinical breast examination (CBE), and Pap smears. Logistic regression models assessed the predictors of screening use. Having a regular source of care significantly predicted all screening use for both elderly and nonelderly, controlling for ethnicity, sociodemographics, health status, access to care, proportion of life in the US, and cancer attitudes. Elderly women (>65 yrs) were significantly less likely to have ever had and to have recently had Pap smears than younger women, controlling for the other variables; being elderly also tended to be an independent predictor of ever and recent mammography and CBE use. There was a trend for health status to act differently in predicting Pap smear use for the two age groups. For younger women, being in poor health increased the odds of Pap smear screening, while for elderly women, being in good health increased the odds of screening.

Strongest concerns were recurrence, pain, death, harm from adjuvant treatment, and bills. Body-image concerns were moderate; concern about rejection was minimal. Younger women had stronger sexual and partner-related concerns than older women. Hispanic women had many stronger concerns and more disruption than other women. Life and pain concerns and sexuality concerns contributed uniquely to predicting emotional and psychosexual disruption; life and pain concerns and rejection concerns contributed to predicting social disruption.

The most important correlates of children's prevention practices were their parents' sun protection habits. Multiple regression models-which included knowledge, beliefs, program policies, and covariates related to sun protection-explained a total of between 38% and 41% of the variance in children's sun safety habits, 22% to 25% of parents' habits, and 24% of recreation staff members' sun safety habits. The models were less successful at predicting the use of hats, shirts, and shade seeking and a composite sun protection habits index.

The study was conducted from 1991-1998. The analysis was restricted to 1,111 individuals (mean age 75.0 yrs) without dementia at baseline for whom both fasting lipid levels and apolipoprotein E genotype were determined. The diagnosis of dementia was based on standard research criteria. 286 (25.7%) of the Ss became demented during followup. Of those, 61 (21.3%) were classified as having dementia with stroke and 225 (78.7%) as having probable Alzheimer's disease. The study showed an independent association between the level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the risk of dementia with stroke. The association was even stronger when LDL levels were corrected for the cholesterol carried by lipoprotein (a). These findings may have important implications for the management of elderly patients with a history of stroke and should be a focus of future research.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter begins by highlighting some conceptual differences between Western models of counselling and psychotherapy by focusing on the problems with the Western concept of the autonomous self. A brief case illustration shows how conceptual clashes in counselling and psychotherapy can be damaging. After a review of 3 models proposed for a multiethnic society, the focus is on a nine-dimensional ethnomedical model which is illustrated with a framework for counselling and psychotherapy and followed by a detailed analysis of a case study. The question as to whether a transcultural model can be assimilated within mainstream Western models of counselling and psychotherapy is considered. It is acknowledged that some concepts in indigenous counselling and psychotherapy may not be compatible for integration and may need to exist in parallel. I focus on one group of ethnic minority people who have made Britain their home-those from the Indian subcontinent-since I am more familiar with them, but hopefully my comments will have relevance for the counselling and psychotherapy of culturally different clients with diverse religious backgrounds.

This book examines the many complex issues surrounding counselling and therapy in a multicultural society, and highlights the difficulties that cultural differences can bring to the therapeutic setting. Addressing a range of theoretical, practical and methodological issues, ""Counselling in a Multicultural Society"" aims to sensitize readers to the cultural and racial setting in which counselling occurs, and to raise awareness of the specific counselling needs of those from differing backgrounds. The book explores the impact of culture on identity, and of cultural differences on interaction. It looks at how one might take a client's cultural context into consideration, or deal with racism, and provides a sophisticated account of the salient value systems of Western and non-Western cultures.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Prejudice and discrimination are at the core of innumerable issues, problems, and interactions in everyday human behavior and as such should be an intrinsic part of the introductory psychology course. The desired pedagogical objective is the student's own analysis and internalization of what scientific psychology has to say about prejudice and discrimination. This understanding is a basic need in a multicultural, multiethnic society, and in an increasingly global community. This activity offers a variety of teaching suggestions to help students learn about the causes and effects of prejudice (attitudes and beliefs) and discrimination (behavior) based on those attitudes and beliefs at different points of the introductory psychology course.

A substantial proportion of residual variance remained after the 2 primary factors were extracted, and correlations among this residual variance suggested meaningful differences in the perpetration and experience of dating violence for males and females. Furthermore, the factor structure for males' self-reported victimization suggested that items representing psychological and mild physical aggression, which loaded on 1 factor, may be perceived similarly. Convergent validity analyses that examined the correlation among CTS traditional and factor scores with jealous actions, control tactics, and attitudes justifying males' and females' use of dating aggression provided initial support for the constructs identified. Results are discussed in terms of improving measurement of dating aggression.

Therefore, the authors developed a chronic disease risk index (CDRI) and investigated its relation with chronic disease in a multiethnic cohort. A total of 15,693 men and 16,007 women (18+ yrs) in Hawaii who reported their diet and other lifestyle behaviors from 1975-1980 were followed until 1994. A semi-quantitative composite CDRI with scores ranging from 1-10 included the rankings for smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Cox's proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the relative risk for chronic diseases. With higher CDRIs, the RRs for cancer incidence, mortality from cancer, coronary heart disease, and stroke increased significantly. Among the 5 components of the CDRI, smoking had the greatest influence on chronic disease risk, followed by body mass index. Positive health behavior reflected by the CDRI is associated with a lower risk of cancer and greater longevity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Discusses cultural homelessness (CH), the unique experiences and feelings reported by some multicultural individuals. Ethnically related concepts found in the cross-cultural and multiethnic literature (eg., marginality, intercultural effectiveness, ethnic enclaves, and reference group) are used to explain how CH may arise from cross-cultural tensions within the ethnically mixed family and between the family and its culturally different environment, especially due to geographic moves. CH is conceptualized as a situationally imposed developmental challenge, forcing the child to accommodate to contradictory and changing norms, values, verbal and nonverbal communication styles, and attachment processes. Culturally homeless individuals may enjoy a broader, stronger cognitive and social repertoire because of their multiple cultural frames of reference. However, code-switching complexities may lead to emotional and social confusion, which, if internalized, may result in self-blame and shame. Culturally encoded emotion labeling may be disrupted, leading to alexithymia.

Data were collected through Treatwell 5-A-Day, a randomized, controlled, worksite-based intervention study designed to increase F&V intake in community health center workers. The self-administered survey included questions on demographics, eating habits, and barriers to F&V intake. Barriers were scored, with higher values reflecting higher perceived barriers, resulting in three factors: general (including taste, time, and availability at home and restaurants), expense, and worksite availability. The general and expense barriers scores were higher and worksite barriers scores lower in nonwhites and those with less education, with lower incomes, and in labor, service, or paraprofessional occupations. General barriers scores decreased with increasing age and the expense barrier score was higher in women. In multivariate analysis, ethnicity, occupation, and age were no longer associated with the general barriers score when education and income were controlled.There was a significant education by income interaction. Only the general barriers score was significantly associated with F&V intake. In conclusion, perceived barriers to F&V intake increased with decreasing income and education, especially at low incomes, and were related to lower consumption of F&V.

The event, which I shall describe in more detail below, was videorecorded in 1992 in a classroom of grade three and four students in an elementary school serving a multiethnic population in downtown Toronto. I was both the camera operator and the visiting adult. Some years later, I selected the videotape of the shoebox experiment as the basis for practical work in my graduate class on discourse analysis. There were two reasons for choosing this material. The first was because of its completeness as the record of the various stages of an activity, from initial selection by the two children to the writing of the texts in which they reported what they had done and learned; the second was that, as I had been the ""visiting teacher,"" I would be able to offer a participant's perspective and also to encourage the sort of critical analysis of the interaction that would have been ethically less acceptable if another teacher had been involved. As it turned out, both these expectations were fulfilled, though the second not exactly as I had anticipated--as I shall explain below.

Subtypes were compared across (1) teacher-rated temperament; (2) self-rated competence; and (3) peer behavioral ratings, social acceptance, and social status scores. Children classified as aggressive victims were associated with higher peer ratings of rejection and disruptiveness and lower ratings of leadership and cooperativeness; they had teacher ratings of more negative mood and lower self-ratings of social competence. Ratings of peer social status indicated lower acceptance of aggression in girls than in boys.

A multiethnic school population of sixth and seventh grade girls and boys was administered a survey designed to tap the variables of interest. Students then were categorized by their two assistant principals into four aggression groups according to guidelines that addressed levels of aggression demonstrated at school during one academic year. Scales were formulated from survey items that pertained to the targeted dimensions, and scaled scores for the final sample of 488 students were compared across aggression groups. Aggression levels were differentiated demographic, cognitive, and social variables. Aggression levels differed significantly along gender and ethnicity. Girls exceeded boys in the Nonaggressive group, boys exceeded girls in the Moderately Aggressive group, and boys and girls were categorized with similar proportions into both the Mildly Aggressive and Severely Aggressive groups. In addition, African American students exceeded Hispanic students and Hispanic students exceeded European American students in the Mildly Aggressive, Moderately Aggressive, and Severely Aggressive groups. Aggression levels were further differentiated by student reports about their relationships. The most powerfully discriminating social variable was student reports about negative behaviors displayed by their close friends. Reports about relationships with teachers and families also varied significantly across aggression groups. Ethnicity interacted with aggression level, in association with perceptions of negative relationships with teachers. Finally, aggression levels were delineated by student reports about aggressive behaviors they demonstrated toward peers at school as well as by aggressive behaviors demonstrated toward them by others. Counter the theory of hostile attributional bias, less aggressive students reported fewer aggressive behaviors, although gender and ethnic groups varied significantly in their responses. In addition, less aggressive students reported less victimization, with ethnic groups responding differently. Results were interpreted as supporting the treatment of aggression as a multidimensional construct rather than as a forced dichotomy. Replication studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of differentiating levels of aggression among youth.

Four hypotheses were examined in this study. Hypothesis one stated that there would be a significant relationship between urbanization and multicultural life styles. More specifically, in component 1a it was expected that as the number of years of urbanization increased, multicultural distance scores away from American Indian culture would increase. In component 1b, it was expected that as urbanization increased, multicultural coexistence scores would increase. Hypothesis two stated that there would be a significant relationship between boarding school exposure and multicultural life styles. Hypothesis three stated that there would be a significant relationship between ethnic heritage (monoethnic vs. multiethnic) and multicultural life styles. In component 3a, it was expected that the monoethnic sub-sample would have significantly lower mean multicultural distance scores than the multiethnic sub-sample. In component 3b, it was expected that the monoethnic sub-sample would have significantly lower mean multicultural coexistence scores than the multiethnic sub-sample. Hypothesis 4a stated that the Anglo-American multicultural direction score would be significantly higher than the ""other"" multicultural direction score for the entire sample. In component 4b, it was expected that the difference between the Anglo-American multicultural direction scores and ""other"" (African American, Asian American, and/or Latino) multicultural direction scores would be significantly greater for those who attended boarding school than those who did not attend boarding school. In component 4c, it was expected that the difference between the Anglo-American multicultural direction scores and ""other"" (African American, Asian American, and/or Latino) multicultural direction scores would be significantly greater for those who are monoethnic than those who are multiethnic. The results indicated that with respect to hypothesis 1a, the longer an American Indian lives in Los Angeles County, the more likely he/she is to move away from American Indian culture. Hypothesis 1b was not supported by the statistical results. With respect to hypotheses 2a and 2b, these hypotheses were not supported by the statistical results. Results indicated that with respect to hypothesis 3a, monoethnics are more likely to maintain their culture of origin while multiethnics are more likely to move way from American Indian culture. Hypothesis 3b was not supported by the statistical results. Results indicate that with respect to hypothesis 4a, the Anglo-American multicultural direction score was significantly higher than the ""other"" multicultural direction score for the entire sample. With respect to hypothesis 4b, this hypothesis was not supported by the statistical results. Results indicate that with respect to hypothesis 4c, this hypothesis was not supported by the statistical results. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

Many political analysts detect parallels in these two occurrences; but this dissertation argues that the anti-system movements in China and the USSR had little in common even though both apparently expressed similar discontent with their own governmental systems. Although political decision making and leadership are generally considered central to understanding political processes, this study shows the surrounding situational political context may have been decisive in shaping these political processes. This dissertation attempts to develop a new multi-dimensional paradigm to analyze or ""disassemble"" the context into four subparadigms: (1) economic competition, (2) national and organizational culture, (3) the political psychological environment of a subliminal repression-fulfillment continuum, and (4) the reproducible procedures of systemic processes. Several aspects of these subparadigms have been overlooked in the literature as political scientists puzzle over new ways to interpret the unpredicted upheavals in China and in the USSR. The Tiananmen uprising was mostly a mass student movement without the economic and political goals of the movement that toppled the USSR's system. Why the Chinese and Soviet governments responded differently to the crises of 1989 and 1991 can be explained by examining five phenomena: (1) the different leadership styles and personalities of Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and Deng, (2) the degree of reliability of the instruments of violent suppression, (3) the highly unified and centralized Chinese system as compared to the former USSR's multiethnic federation and its layered geographic decentralization, (4) the advanced erosion of ideologies at different rates, (5) and finally China's priority of economic over political reforms as compared to the USSR's placement of political over economic reforms. This dissertation's contribution lies in its theoretical insights into the processes of these historical events, rather than its evaluation of the outcomes which are generally accepted. But the implications are weighty for both those who want to see development take place democratically and those who argue that democracy is too costly during periods of crises.

While there were significant correlations between psychological distress and reported vulnerability to HIV in the treatment sample, and psychological distress and anticipated mortality in the university sample, there was no significant relation between anticipated mortality and perceived vulnerability to HIV in either sample. Cluster analysis revealed 4 distinct and meaningful groups in both samples, including parallel high- and low-functioning subgroups. Multivariate group differences in both samples were validated via corresponding group differences in (1) motives for drinking during sex, and (2) markers of serious psychological distress (e.g., suicidal thoughts and attempts).

The book is intended for human service professionals, teachers, researchers, and students interested in the issue of early adolescent drug use and its causes and pervasiveness in a multiethnic population. Longitudinal studies, including the one presented in these pages, have identified many risk and protective factors or processes that are linked to adolescent drug use. We review these throughout this book and present new information from our own research. Our point of departure is to extend and elaborate descriptive research and models of adolescent drug research to cover the unique and diverse experiences of adolescents who are Hispanic, African American, and White non-Hispanic. The ultimate goal of this book is to stimulate new thinking about the pathways to drug use.
(from the book) Data for the study were obtained from 3 sources: (1) a large sample of boys and a smaller sample of girls entering the 6th and 7th grades of middle schools in the Dade Country Public School System in the Fall of 1990, (2) a sample of parents of students included in the samples and (3) a nonprobability sample of teachers who rated the same students. Three waves of data were secured on the student sample; 2 were gathered from the parents; and, one was conducted with the teachers at Time 1 (Fall 1990). Data collection for Times 2 and 3 were Fall 1991 and Spring 1993. The mean age of the student sample at Time 1 was 11.6 yrs.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In 1994, nearly 3 million reports of child abuse or neglect were made to public child welfare service agencies because of concern about the health, safety, and developmental conditions of a child. Although a report alone does not prove that abuse has occurred, this large number does show substantial national awareness of abuse and neglect and a willingness of the public to respond to those problems. Annual public opinion polls reveal that Americans are increasingly concerned about and report having done something about child abuse. Topics include: effects of child abuse; services to abused and neglected children and families; the policy response; independent living initiative; family prevention and family support services; Multiethnic Placement aAct (MEPA); from legal permanence to psychological permanence: a questionable paradigm shift; and a lifetime developmental perspective.

During a 3-yr period, representative samples totaling 3,542 men and women (aged 18-85 yrs) from 15 states participated in mock juries and completed a questionnaire that assessed a wide range of opinions and self-reported behaviors. Among the questions was a Homophobia Scale designed to assess potential jurors' attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Findings are discussed in terms of the effects of Ss' gender and ethnicity on homophobic attitudes, and profiles of potentially homophobic jurors are developed. This study also identifies the types of questions that could be posed by attorneys during voir dire jury selection to eliminate potential jurors who may be biased against lesbians and gay men.

I conclude this chapter with a discussion of liberal models of multiethnic education and why they are inadequate to the task. I then propose an alternative. This alternative model gives one a new and more global identity as a simple human being on a journey of inner and outer awakening to replace the older identities of nation, race, religion, ethnicity, or radical ideologue.

Parents of 100 Sami and 121 Norwegian students completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Behavior problems were assessed in relation to ethnicity and ethnic context (geographic region and family context). Results show that rates of behavior problems (CBCL and YSR) were generally high in both ethnic groups and were highest among girls. Sami adolescents, particularly those living in assimilated ethnic communities, reported more behavior problems than Norwegian adolescents. It is concluded that ethnic factors have significant impact on behavior problems in indigenous minority adolescents living in a multiethnic context.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses with longitudinal data were used to assess transitional/temporal influences of family variables on the initiation of IDU. Findings reveal large differences in family structure among the 3 race/ethnic groups. African-American adolescents report the lowest incidence of IDU initiation, and the weakest effects of family structure and environment on substance use. Cumulative effects of family risk factors were strongly associated with increased probabilities of IDU initiation, but there were temporal as well as race/ethnic variations on these effects. Deteriorating changes in family environments were stronger predictors of the initiation of drug use among Hispanic immigrants than nonimmigrants, and family SES was a predictor for immigrant Hispanics only. The relationship between family structure and drug use initiation varied in the context of temporal indicators of family environments, and the accumulation of family risk factors was a stronger predictor of illicit drug initiation than family structure.

A wide range of new and established predictors of smoking behavior was assessed, and their associations with ever smoking and susceptibility to smoking were assessed within ethnicity (white, African American, and Hispanic). The 149-item questionnaire assessed sociodemographic, socioenvironmental, behavioral, and personal factors. White Ss smoked in substantially higher proportions than African-American Ss, with Hispanic Ss in-between. Simultaneously adjusting for other variables, the odds of ever smoking and susceptibility to smoking were significantly lower among African-Americans when compared with whites; odds ratios for Hispanics and whites did not differ. Across all 3 ethnicities, the most important predictor of both ever smoking and susceptibility to smoking was the smoking status of the 3 best friends.

Results show that blood pressure) (BP) and heart rate (HR) were elevated during periods of emotional activation (high negative affect or high arousal). Diastolic BP was lower during periods involving high decisional control, and HR was lower during high-control, low-demand activities.

Data were gathered through interviews with the participants. Over 40% of these relations were with individuals in the same locality, and almost 50% referred to kin. Kin acted as trouble-shooters; friends were social companions; and neighbors were less significant.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Low-literate, low-income populations face unique issues as they attempt to modify their diet to lower risk of chronic disease. The goal of the Stanford Nutrition Action Program (SNAP) was to design a curriculum that would address such issues and stimulate reduction of dietary fat. Initial focus groups and pilot tests were conducted to assess nutrition knowledge, interests, and dietary habits of a multiethnic, low-literate population. These investigations revealed that a nutrition education curriculum tailored to a population with low literacy skills would need to address the taste, cost, and convenience of low-fat foods, and teach participants how to incorporate low-fat foods and cooking methods into their family's diet with minimal disruption. These findings, combined with published data on food intake and preferences, were used to design the SNAP curriculum. The SNAP classroom curriculum operationalized principles of adult education, constructs from social learning theory, and followed established national guidelines on how to develop appropriate print materials for low-literate adults. Each of its six lessons included role modeling, goal setting, problem solving, group activities, and skills building tasks; many included SNAP videotapes, food demonstrations, and posters that enhanced group discussions. Print materials were written at or below the 5th grade reading level. The SNAP curriculum combined interactive teaching techniques and behavior change methods to successfully teach and stimulate the interest of low-literate, low-income population to overcome barriers to reducing fat.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article examines social-psychological factors affecting language maintenance by analyzing a group of second-generation heritage language learners' reflections on their networks of language contacts in childhood and adolescence. The focused group is American Shin Nisei (new second generation Japanese) university students in Hawaii. The data were collected through intensive interviews with six bilingual and semibilingual focal students and through extensive interviews with numerous other Shin Nisei university students. A statistical reference is also provided. Analysis indicates the strong assimilative pulls of the dominant culture even in multicultural/multiethnic Hawaii. In this sociocultural milieu, Japanese mothers play a critical role in Shin Niseis' Japanese language maintenance, especially oral skills, although a mother's choices cannot determine children's behavior; their language behavior interacts with social identity, which may change across time and space. This article also discusses problems facing educational institutions for Japanese language maintenance in Hawaii, such as the dominant use of English at heritage language schools and Shin Nisei students' socially frustrating and academically unsatisfactory learning experiences in formal foreign language classes.

In a sample of 361 independent-living, culturally-diverse volunteers (aged 60+ yrs), Ss were divided into 3 treatment groups: an OT group, a generalized group activity (""social"") control group, or a nontreatment control group. Ss were tested using self-administered questionnaires designed to measure physical and social function, self-rated health, life satisfaction, and depressive symptoms. Significant benefits for the OT treatment were found across various health, function, and quality-of-life domains. Results suggest that preventive OT programs have comprehensive positive effects and might mitigate against health risks of older adulthood.

As part of a multi-disciplinary, multiethnic project in Manchester the authors present their experience in developing modified versions of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS). Several factors have been proposed as essential prerequisites before validating known tests in a new population. An amalgamation of methods from the literature was employed to modify the instruments. Culturally acceptable versions of the MMSE and AMTS were developed for use in a wider two-phase study to validate the instrument. Results from a pilot study with 19 Ss from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India are reported. The authors conclude by noting that the main purpose of the study was to focus on the process of modifying the instruments. In particular, the value of amalgamating validated methodology and emphasizing the community's role and participation was demonstrated.

The results were used to construct cognitive-affective domain maps that underlay elated, dismayed, and ambivalent reactions. By promoting a deeper understanding and appreciation of reactions to the verdict, the authors believe the domain maps facilitate overcoming the widespread tendency to attribute the cause of divergent reactions to an individual's race. The results have implications for the understanding of cultural differences.

Measures included the Racial Identity Attitudes Scale, and J. S. Phinney's (1992) Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure. Results revealed that: (1) mean differences existed among ethnic groups on all variables examined; (2) proximal attitudes mediated relations between psychological characteristics and trial outcome beliefs; and (3) specific relations depended (to some extent) on ethnic group membership. Differences within and between ethnic groups may reflect schematic differences due to differential experiences with societal institutions, identification with (or rejection of) mainstream values, and race relations in American society.

The purpose of this study was to explore the story-related topics of discussion initiated by preschoolers as they used multiethnic books. In addition to books depicting only white characters (Euro-American), two categories of multiethnic books were used: Culturally Conscious, depicting a specific ethnic group in an accurate way; and Diversity Explicit, depicting a variety of ethnic groups and containing text that specifically addresses diversity issues. Eleven children (ages 53 to 66 months) and the teacher in one daycare classroom participated. Audiotaped recordings of children's discussions were made during small group readings conducted by adults, emergent readings, and drawing pictures about the books. Content analysis of all transcripts revealed very few child-initiated ethnically specific comments (comments pertaining to physical characteristics that tend to differ between ethnic groups, such as skin and hair color). Further content analysis of the transcripts from the small group readings and emergent readings revealed story-related themes and topics in the children's discussion within each category of books. Themes and topics within small group readings seem to suggest that children use language which indicates current understandings as well as the construction of new understandings of material related to the books. Themes and topics within emergent readings revealed children's importations (information not included in the original text) from sources such as background knowledge and prior small group readings. Across small group readings, emergent readings, and the drawing activity, slight differences in the topics discussed by children emerged between book categories; Diversity Explicit books seem most likely to foster discussion about ethnicity-specific issues. If preschool teachers in daycare classrooms similar to the one used in this study want to provide multiethnic books for their children in an effort to initiate discussion regarding ethnic differences, it appears that the teachers need to be prepared to initiate that discussion themselves as the children are unlikely to do so without prompting.

Alcohol use was consistently related to smoking across ethnic and gender groups, and this association was enhanced among older drinkers. The belief that smoking is not related to cancer was associated with an almost twofold increase of ever smoking.

It was found that 37.5% of the sample engaged in one or more acts of serious delinquency, with AfricanAmericans reporting they had engaged in significantly more of these behaviors. The best predictors of theft/vandalism were low family pride and family substance abuse for Hispanics, low family communication for African-Americans, and low family pride for White non-Hispanics. The findings indicate that traditional family factors that have been used repeatedly to understand delinquency by male adolescents were not strong predictors of delinquency among the adolescent girls in the sample.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Gender and History: Special Issue on Gender, Nationalisms, and National Identities (1993). This special issue of Gender and History takes as its point of departure the absence of gender from recent examinations of the construction of nations and national identities, particularly in the influential work of Benedict Anderson. Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism. Of necessity, these papers examine not only the significance of gender, but the intersections of gender and race, especially in Australia, the United States, and Britain, where statebuilding in multiracial and multiethnic societies also meant the establishment of racial domination. The process of differentiation and displacement that was part of the American and Australian establishment of White domination and national sovereignty over and against indigenous peoples also appeared in the definition of British national identity. These essays point to new ways of thinking about statebuilding, the eonstrnction of national identity, nationalism and gender in, both, East and West.

Given the current controversy in the United States surrounding affirmative action, ethnocentricism, and diversity, the fresh perspective on these issues offered by this book is timely. Verma, Zee, and Skinner completed their study in nine British schools in the London and Greater Manchester area. However, their findings regarding the merits and faults of multiethnic education in a pluralistic society and the implications of these findings are clearly global. The authors used semistructured interviews, informal conversations, and small group discussions with teachers and students in addition to direct observations and a questionnaire given to 2,326 students. The authors conducted an analysis of data by gender and ethnicity using tests for degrees of significance in emerging patterns. Verma et al. drew upon the various data generated by their research instruments to create a portrait of each school in terms of its interethnic relationships.

Race/ethnicity; belief that mammograms detect cancer, ease the mind, and provide accurate results; concern over the radiation, pain, and cost associated with receiving a mammogram; and other independent variables were tested as predictors of screening mammography utilization. Regression analysis identified that the belief that having a mammogram eases recipients' minds was the most significant predictor of screening mammography utilization. None of the other health beliefs or health concerns were significant predictors. Race/ethnicity had no direct effects on utilization nor was it a confounder in the relationship between health beliefs, concerns and utilization. These results indicate that, along with emphasizing the importance of mammograms in early detection of breast cancer, stressing the reassurance that mammography brings recipients may be an effective health education strategy for elderly women of different racial/ethnic backgrounds.

Data was taken from a larger ethnographic study of intergroup relations between long-term residents and Latino new immigrants in 3 Houston neighborhoods; length of residence, spatial distribution, and sociocultural conditions were assessed. Strong ethnic commitment was shown to act as a buffer against an insecure or unfamiliar environment. In all 3 communities, social distance reflected powerful African American ethnic identity, which, with its internalized stereotypes, prevented creation of shared community identity in multiethnic settings. Long tenure and spatial proximity of ethnic groups did not alter the impact of ethnic identity on community identity. A high degree of tolerance and an absence of open conflict among ethnic groups was observed in all 3 communities; the authors suggest that the physical presence of an ethnically diverse environment produced social adaptations to reduce conflict.

South Africa today, with the drafting of a new constitution that will enfranchise all its citizens, is negotiating and moving toward a greater degree of multiethnic harmony. Nonetheless, because the scars of apartheid will remain for a long time, the present text describes childhood and adolescence in a society that has been severely divided and traumatized by institutionalized racism. This book describes current counseling and educational issues in South Africa and a myriad of disorders that are the effects of structural inequality.

The concept of empowerment has been proposed as a phenomenon of interest to community psychologists and has since become an important focus within this branch of psychology. As detailed in the first chapter of the dissertation, a small number of studies have aimed to advance empowerment theory by defining and explicating its essential components, and by determining which ecological factors sustain its development. The present research also focused on contributing to the theory of empowerment. Accordingly, an operational definition of empowerment with four components was developed as a basis for action research. These components include the following: A perception of self-efficacy and competence; the acquisition of knowledge, skills and access to resources; the development of a critical consciousness; participation in concerted action. The dissertation includes three studies. First, a pilot study documenting the early outcome of a community economic development (CED) intermediary organization initiated by a cross-cultural coalition of grass-roots groups. The organization was created in response to the economic needs of target groups including immigrants and refugees, single parents, the young unemployed and persons receiving social assistance. A qualitative methodology was used to explore the psychosocial impact of participation in the organization. The forty-two participants' responses were analyzed inductively to extract themes connected with the operational definition of empowerment as outlined above, and with four ecological dimensions that have been found to promote empowerment. The themes brought up by participants were detailed. Study results were used to outline the organization's impact and in program planning with stakeholder groups. The second study outlines the design, implementation and utilization of results process of a participatory eva (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,,"citizen empowerment through community economic development in multiethnic neighborhood, human Ss","*Community Development

This study was conducted to determine (1) whether student evaluations of teachers and ratings of teacher behaviors are related to the ethnicity of the students, (2) the relationship between overall student evaluations of teachers, classes, and ratings of teacher behaviors, and (3) the relationship between student evaluations of teachers, ratings of teacher behaviors, and student achievement. Method. Two teacher evaluation instruments were administered to students in undergraduate classes at a Christian college and a Christian university. The Student Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) was used as a high-inference evaluation form and the Teacher Behavior Inventory (TBT) was used as a low-inference rating form. The sample included 414 students from one college with a multicultural population and 67 students from one college with a homogeneous ethnic population. Results. In both the college and the university, no relationship was found between ethnicity and student evaluations of teachers. In the multiethnic setting, differences were found between the ratings of teacher behaviors by Caucasian students and the students from the remaining ethnic groups (p <). The Caucasian students tended to rate teachers lower in the areas of structuring and interaction, and higher in the areas of interest and pacing than the students from the other ethnic groups represented. Student ratings of teacher behaviors were significantly related to students' overall evaluation of teachers and classes. The behaviors that were significantly related to the evaluations differed for each ethnic group. Student evaluations of teachers and ratings of teacher behaviors were significantly, though weakly, related to achievement. The areas of evaluations and ratings that were related to achievement were different for each ethnic group. Conclusions. Students in general tend to give teachers positive evaluations and there were no significant differences among evaluations of teachers done (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,,"ethnicity & student achievement, student evaluations of teachers & student ratings of teacher behavior, undergraduates in colleges with multicultural population vs homogenous population","*Academic Achievement

The studies compose Pathways to Early Cancer Detection in Four Ethnic Groups, a 4-yr National Cancer Institute funded program project. The Pathways project studied the relationship of race/ethnicity, SES, and culture to breast and cervical cancer screening. A multidisciplinary, multicultural team of investigators assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of 4,228 women from 5 race/ethnic groups and their barriers to screening utilization. A planning framework guided the development of interventions and analyses of the similarities and differences in screening behaviors across race/ethnic groups. Baseline data for women ages 18 to 74 yrs showed that levels of screening were higher than national averages for Latina, White, and Black women but lower for Chinese and Vietnamese women. Analyses revealed the importance of education and insurance in obtaining recommended screening regardless of race/ethnicity. However, race, ethnicity, and culture are important to the tailoring of effective interventions.

Ss were given a modified Belief Systems Test and Multiethnic Climate Inventory (MCI). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and univariate analysis showed significant differences in MCI scores for abstract, middle level, and concrete thinkers, revealing that concrete thinkers tend to resist changes that clash with their beliefs against multiethnic interaction, and that abstract thinkers were more likely to consider and adopt change. These imply that teachers' TLs must be considered when designing multiethnic training programs and that diverse experiences be provided to move all teachers toward abstract TLs.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In this work we are concerned with productivity and performance capacities as related to levels of anxiety and rational control in adolescents from different ethnic groups in southern Brazil. This research had its start in a project that we have been carrying out since 1900 on the capacity for productiveness. We were then seeking to verify whether the level of situational anxiety was higher in Tukuna Indians or in non-Tukuna white people who live in Alto Solimoes, State of Amazonas, in the north of Brazil. Thirty-six subjects of both sexes, including 21 with a diagnosis of hypertension, were administered the Rorschach and Spielberger's Trait-State Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Data collected with the Rorschach among adolescents of the South of Brazil allow us to conclude the following: 1. Afro-Brazilian adolescents resemble Tukuna adolescents tested in the interior of Amazonas with respect to low capacity for productivity. 2. Contrary to adolescents of Portuguese origin tested in the interior of Amazonas, Portuguese adolescents of Rio Grande do Sul did not show low capacity for productivity. 3. There is a positive correlation between situational anxiety and concern with performance and productivity in Brazilian adolescents of German, Israelite, Italian, and Portuguese origin.That is, these ethnic groups presented anxiety directly related to concerns with performance and productivity. 4. Adolescents of Afro-Brazilian origin, on the other hand, did not give evidence of anxiety and concern about performance and production capacity. It is discussed whether this finding is related to accommodation and dependence originating in the acceptance, without due resistance, of the acculturation of dependency since the slavery period in Brazil.

Examples are provided from Malaysia's leading English-language newspapers of how the English-speaking ethnic Malay elites are institutionalizing their dominance through English, which is the native language of very few Malaysians but is still the principal code for communication among Malaysia's multiethnic elites. Analysis of this primary journalistic data demonstrates that a major way that this occurs is by replacement of English words with denotatively (but not connotatively) equivalent terms from Malay, resulting in the covert expression of racism and the institutionalization of inequality.

Fifty-nine fourth grade children and their three classroom teachers from a multiethnic low income elementary school were interviewed regarding their views of competence and incompetence in the school setting. Children were interviewed in groups of three to four, divided by their teacher-rated competence level and gender. The interview format used was the same for the teachers and for the children and included questions addressing competence and incompetence in general as well as specific domains such as academic, behavioral, social and emotional competence. A reliable coding system was developed to describe the children's perceptions of competence and incompetence and a separate reliable system was developed for the teachers' ideas. Results of the study indicate that a core group of constructs about competence and incompetence are salient for all or most of the children, regardless of competence level or gender. Within this core group of constructs, there are a few ideas about competence and incompetence that were emphasized by children in the high and/or medium competence groups that were not emphasized by children in the low competence group. There were no gender differences found amongst these constructs cited by most of the children. Differences in the perceptions of children of different competence level groups and genders were found amongst some of the constructs that were less frequently mentioned and not common to all of the children. Most of the children's salient constructs are also significant to the teachers, although the teachers had additional constructs, often more abstract, that were highly relevant to them. No one competence level or gender group of children had perceptions that more closely matched the teachers' ideas about both competence a (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,,"conceptions of school-based competence & incompetence, 4th graders vs their teachers","*Academic Self Concept

Thirty-one Black-White biracial adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 served as subjects in this within-group design. The variables assessed were: (a) the strength of biracial ethnic identity, (b) the self-label the adolescent used for ethnic identification, (c) the level of adaptive functioning, and (d) the racial composition of the adolescent's environment. The two predictor variables for the dependent variable of adaptive functioning were the strength of biracial ethnic identity and the self-label of the adolescents. The predictor variable for the dependent variable of ethnic self-label was the racial composition of the biracial adolescent's environment. Adaptive functioning was assessed by the Roberts Apperception Test for Children, ethnic identity and self-label were assessed by the Multiethnic Identity Measure, and the racial composition of the adolescent's environment was assessed by the questionnaire. Prior to hypothesis testing, intercorrelations found that no significant relationships existed between SES, age, the Biracial Multiethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), and the Roberts Apperception Test for Children (RATC) data at the.05 level of significance. The results of the simple Pearson correlation between the data from the Biracial MEIM and the RATC adaptive scales were not significant. In a post hoc analysis of the 3 MEIM's (Black, White and Biracial) it was found that the Black MEIM and the White MEIM significantly correlated with the RATC subscale, Resolution, and the total RATC adaptive scale. The results of a t-test found that a significant difference was not found between the Black and Biracial MEIM on the adolescent's self-label.

Such factors may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of abusive behavior within ethnically diverse families. A model is offered to provide a theoretical framework that includes sociocultural factors in the prediction of child physical abuse and that guides this research. The present study examined the impact of sociodemographic factors (ethnicity and education), abuse history, chronic urban stress, perceived racism, and family environment (cohesion, expressiveness, conflict, active-recreational orientation, and moral-religious emphasis) on abusive behavior in eighty-eight (N = 88) female caretakers. Data was collected in three settings, two mental health centers and one public school. Fifty-four percent (N = 46) of the participants were African-American, thirty-seven percent (N = 31) were Latina, and nine percent (N = 8) were Caucasian. The design of the study was correlational. The investigator hypothesized that ethnicity and education would be significantly related to stress; that the five family environment subscales would mediate the relationship between stress and abusive behavior; and that after accounting for sociodemographic factors and abuse history, urban life stress, perceived racism, and family environment would account for a significant portion of the explained variance in abusive behavior. Two-way ANOVAS and a hierarchical multiple regression were used to test the research hypotheses. The research hypotheses were partially supported by the data. However, additional analyses were conducted which yielded significant results. The results of these analyses note that sociodemographics and abuse history were not strong predictors of abusive behavior. Urban life stress had consistent main effects on abusive behavior. The active-recreational orientation subscale of family environment also had a significant main effect on abusive behavior after controlling (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",,,"sociodemographic factors & abuse history & urban stress & perceived racism & family environment, child physical abuse, African-American vs Latina vs Caucasian female caretakers","*Child Abuse

A total of 336 students, 110 males and 224 females, from a large multiethnic school district in Central California were administered the Body Image Questionnaire. Convergent and divergent validation was attempted using the Body Cathexis Scale and the Homonym Test. A principal component analysis with varimax rotations was completed with the 190 valid female questionnaires. Four factors were identified using 13 of the original 19 items. Only one of the factors resembled one of Bruchon-Schweitzer's factors. The study confirmed divergent validation with the Body Cathexis Scale and Homonym Test. The results continued to highlight the elusive nature of body image and the difficulty in defining it. The interpretation of the factors suggests the need for further research to identify the dimensions of body image and to establish a reliable and valid way to measure it. The results also suggest that feminist writings, poetry, and literature might be helpful in clarifying the underpinnings of body image.

Ss were 1,935 African American, Hispanic, and White elementary-school boys and girls assessed over a 2-yr period. Individual poverty (INP) and aggression were only significant for the White Ss, with significant interactions between individual and community poverty for the other 2 ethnic groups. A linear structural model to predict aggression from the stress and beliefs variables, INP predicted stress for African American Ss and predicted beliefs supporting aggression for Hispanic Ss. For all ethnic groups, both stress and beliefs contributed significantly to the synchronous prediction of aggression, and for the Hispanic children, the longitudinal predictions were also significant.

Ss were 226 White, African-American, and Hispanic students in 6 5th-grade and 6 7th-grade classes from a rural school district. Four short stories representative of the African-American, White, and Hispanic cultures were read to each class, and Ss then wrote their own comments and rated each story on a scale of 1-5. Responses were analyzed for aesthetic involvement using an instrument developed by D. Wiseman et al (1992). Fifth-grade Ss preferred White stories, while 7th-grade Ss preferred African-American stories. Minority Ss preferred stories about their own culture, but preference did not inhibit the Ss' ability to become aesthetically involved in the stories. It was also revealed that those of the majority culture were much more homogeneous in their preference for stories. The study emphasizes the importance of using multicultural literature in the classroom.

Nearly two-thirds of the Ss who reported rape as an adult had a history of CSA, while approximately one-third of the nonvictimized Ss had a CSA history. An examination of the rates of adult rape within each ethnic group revealed differences between the Ss with and without a history of CSA. Significant differences (i.e., higher rates of rape associated with a prior history of CSA) were found for White, African-American, and Latina Ss, but not for Asian-American Ss. Data highlight the relationship between CSA and adult rape and suggest the need for researchers to take a broader cultural context in which to view sexual victimization.

The author proposes using 3 discrete lenses of organizational culture to highlight the complexity of a school culture at work: the school as a whole, as subcultures, and as fragmented and ambiguous. Data were obtained through school documentation and group and individual interviews with students, faculty, and staff. Findings suggest that institutional realities at the organizational level unify members, but there are inconsistencies that can be detected at the subcultural and individual levels. Meanings are multiple and individually interpreted. Thus, members are able to exercise greater flexibility within the organization while demonstrating the greater autonomous action necessary in multiethnic urban settings. Further, the multiplicity of cultures suggests cultures other than race or ethnicity.

The hypothesis was that domain-specific rather than global self-esteem would be associated with ""crowd"" membership that in turn would be related to risk behavior. Data were gathered through informant interviews and individual surveys. Domain-specific self-esteem was related to crowd affiliation as well as to alcohol and cigarette use; global self-esteem was not related. Crowd affiliation related to alcohol use and sexual behavior after controlling for the effects of demographic and self-esteem variables, but crowd membership did not fully mediate the relationship between self-esteem and risk behavior. Availability of alcohol and cigarettes mediated the relationship between crowd affiliation and use of these substances. Findings support growing evidence that multiple adolescent peer groups exist and that group membership is closely tied to behavior.

They integrate their own clinical experience with multiethnic families into their exhaustive review of the cross-cultural literature on families and offer helpful advice on assessing and treating culturally diverse families. Their work is particularly timely as we face an explosive increase in minority populations in the United States. Psychologists are now beginning to recognize that current knowledge, theories, and clinical practices based primarily on Western tradition are incomplete and in need of significant revisions.

High student ratings for communication ease were also associated with academic achievement. The 2 best predictors of academic achievement were student-rated communication ease and teacher-rated engagement. Findings suggest that it is important for teachers to be sensitive to the level of communication comfort of their students because students who enjoy easier communication may be more likely to be engaged, or more actively involved, in classroom learning and to demonstrate higher academic achievement.

Two case studies are discussed. One found significant differences in interaction patterns in the classrooms of teachers who were classified as ethnically highly tolerant or highly intolerant.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) Over the past ten years, heightened concern about literacy and reading has inspired public and private exploration of what children read, and what makes them want to read. This volume describes research into these questions. Besides showing how best to evoke students' interest in reading, it calls for more interaction between students and teachers as to what books are particularly significant reading. ""Inspiring Literacy"" covers important issues in both children's and adolescent literature. It includes first-hand perspectives of teachers, librarians, editors, and authors. The articles review trends in children's book publishing and book selling; explore revolutionary changes in methods and materials used to teach reading; examine the status of multicultural children's literature; and suggest intriguing nonfiction and poetry books for youths. ""Inspiring Literacy"" is essential reading for elementary and secondary teachers, authors of children's and adolescent literature, students and faculty in book publishing courses, publishers, and librarians. This book may be used as an up-to-date state-of-the-art text for courses in children's and young adult literature.

Authored Book",,"(from the preface) This volume is intended for teachers, their educators and supervisors, and researchers interested in teaching and classroom life. It focuses on the heterogeneous class, a school setting that has achieved some prominence in the recent scientific and professional literature. Upon entering a classroom we are no longer surprised to find extraordinary diversity of student attributes. Immediately apparent in many classes are the different hues of skin and other physical features of students. Observers of the educational scene employ a variety of terms to describe this kind of class. Some refer to it as a mixed-ability class emphasizing the diversity in student academic ability and achievement. Some speak of the multicultural or multiethnic class highlighting differences in the cultural or ethnic traditions and predispositions of children. Others use still different terminology, such as the heterogeneous class, as I have done in this book.

For example, the class of 1990 alone lost 225 students (40 percent) throughout its four high school years (1986-90). Despite numerous problems including poverty, lack of achievement, language difficulties, substance abuse, juvenile delinquency, and teenage pregnancy, SMCISD is a district that recognizes it has natural resources within the school, the home, and the community, and this district is restructuring its approach to education so that all students can be successful learners. Two key programs are crucial to this restructuring effort: the PRIDE Center and Coalition for PRIDE. While the PRIDE center's focus is on dropouts and potential dropouts at the high school level. Coalition for PRIDE focuses on prevention, intervention, and recovery of at-risk students from pre-kindergarten through high school. Education has been restructured in San Marcos. In a little more than a year, 20 would-be dropouts have received regular high school diplomas, and 75 former dropouts are now in the classroom. The school has broad support from community organizations who provide mentors and scholarships for students.

Data were derived from extensive observations of students by a participant-observer whose fieldwork extended over the course of 1 academic year and included interviews of about 50 students. The relevancy of ethnicity tended to be variable, depending on the social situation and the individual's interpretation of the event. The judgment resulting from this interpretation was linked to structural factors in the society. For the students at this multiethnic school, the articulation of ethnicity stemmed from issues of ritual, conflict, interest, and values. The denial of one's ethnic identity centered around prejudice and internalized oppression. Reactions to the racism included denial, intimidation, and defensiveness.

This book will illustrate how six post-industrial nations (Canada, The Federal Republic of Germany, Israel, The Netherlands, The United Kingdom, and The United States) have met, or failed to meet, this challenge. What they have done, or need to do, in the near future in order to promote the practice of democratic living and citzenship for the people in their midst-newcomers and hosts alike. Each of the six countries-as Koskin's next chapter relates-is experiencing a large influx of new populations, some permanent immigrants, others guest workers, refugees, or nationals of former colonial holdings. This volume is based on the contributions made by scholars from the above countries to a conference funded by the Spencer Foundation, and held in the fall of 1988 on the campus of Rutgers University. The conferees were given the charge to ask themselves, and to ask each other: What can we as educational researchers or practitioners do to prepare our youth for cooperative, constructive living in a democracy? How can we meet that challenge?

After the initial training session, use of IT procedures increased markedly and in both classes children initiated more frequently as a consequence. The total number of words spoken to the teacher/nursery nurse, and the average number of words spoken per child, increased in both groups. Analyses of the data for the morning class also showed that the IT procedures increased the use of more complex language forms.

Reviews the book, Silent Boundaries: Cultural Constraints on Sickness and Diagnosis of Iranians in Israel by Karen L. Pliskin (see record 1987-98221-000). The ""silent boundaries"" from which this book takes its title refer to the unrecognized, unacknowledged, and misunderstood cultural differences that render communications difficult and strain interpersonal relations. This book examines the roots and consequences of recurrent misunderstandings between Iranian Jewish immigrant patients and western-trained physicians in multiethnic Israel. The focal point of Pliskin's analysis is the phenomenon known as ""Parsitis."" Parsitis is a pejorative label applied to Iranian patients who seek care for vague somatic concerns that the physician is unable to explain objectively. Although Pliskin's account is interesting and insightful, it could have been strengthened by a more thorough-going comparative perspective. Somatization is familiar to anyone working in a primary health care arena, yet there is relatively little mention of the extensive literature on this phenomenon. Moreover, Pliskin's analysis of the dynamics of the physician-patient relationship in the ""natural history"" of Parsitis would have benefited from a discussion of the social psychology of expectancy effects. Finally, Pliskin teaches exclusively by negative example. Pliskin's book will be of interest to students of emotion, practitioners in multiethnic settings, and medical educators.

Upper-income groups also prospered within the downwardly mobile groups.

Four other 8th-grade classes in the same school were taught with the traditional Whole-Class method. All eleven teachers of History and Geography in the school participated in this experiment and they were assigned at random to one or the other of the two instructional methods. Teachers of the Group-Investigated classes took part in a series of workshops during the first year of the study, until they acquired an acceptable degree of competence in applying the Group-Investigation method in their classrooms. The experiment proper, encompassing 197 pupils in the classes taught with the Group-Investigation method and 154 pupils in classes conducted with the Whole-Class method, was carried out during the second year of the study. Two tests of academic achievement (one in Geography, one in History) were administered both before and after the experiment period. Also, 27 groups, of 6 pupils each, were selected at random from the nine classrooms, i.e. 3 groups from each class. There were 3 pupils of Western and 3 of Middle-Eastern background in each group. These groups engaged in two 15-minute discussions (one in Geography, one in History), and the discussions were videotaped. Data about the pupils' interethnic interactions, and about their verbal and intellectual behavior, were obtained from the analysis by two judges of the videotaped discussions.

Independent variables studied were child body mass index (BMI); teacher-rated Type A behavior; and parent-reported mother BMI, father BMI, parent vigorous activity, and family cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The multiple regression of moderate-intensity activity was significant, with family CVD risk, parent vigorous activity, and father BMI accounting for significant amounts of variance.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Presents several pitfalls in providing cross cultural health care to multiethnic international students. In post industrialized society it is necessary to expand the vision of normal health care where more options and choices are available that are not limited to the professional provider. Western physicians over emphasize the measurements and evaluation of disturbances that brought about the illness to the ultimate neglect of the person having the illness. It is important to realize that international students are not well served by attempts to manage their problems using Western notions of personality and behavior. The final pitfall involves the great tendency to discuss disorders or maladies as a somatization process in international students. The author notes that somatization disorders are all too common a diagnosis in foreign students.

The skit portrayed a discussion about how to spend a free afternoon. 2 boys (actors) consistently overruled a 3rd who suggested a game of table tennis in preference to swimming. In the mixed ethnic-group conditions, the actor different in ethnic affiliation was also the one overruled in the skit. Before watching the skit, Ss rated on a 7-point scale how well they anticipated the actors would ""get along"" and were asked to select the language they expected them to use in the dialogue. 12 test sessions corresponded to each of the experimental conditions. Results reveal that Ss perceived that members of homogeneously composed groups would get along better than heterogeneous groups, especially for all-Chinese groups. While Ss almost unanimously correctly identified the language spoken, they showed much less accuracy in deciding which actors were Tagalog and which Chinese. This technique may be appropriate to study changes in ethnic group relations due to changes in language policy.

Immigrant Ss who had recently arrived in Australia, were unable to speak English, and did not have a supporting social network had a significantly higher rate of depression. Depressed Australian-born Ss often had unhappy, unstable, and insecure childhoods, having been reared in families with marital disruption, violence, alcoholism, and desertion. Some also had previous depressive episodes. A strong supporting social network, especially by the father, and also by the extended family and friends, was significant in preventing depression.

Multivariate analyses identified 3 variables significantly associated with previous misdiagnosis-auditory hallucinations, early age at onset, and ethnicity. Ethnicity remained significantly associated with misdiagnosis of bipolar patients as schizophrenic even after all other significant variables were partialled out of the equation. It appears from these data that Black and Hispanic (Puerto Rican) bipolar patients may be at a higher risk than Whites for misdiagnosis as schizophrenic, particularly if they are young and experience auditory hallucinations during affective episodes.

Reviews the book, Children and Race by David Milner (1983). Race, in this book, means essentially black and white. Although this focus accurately reflects the current research emphasis, it is unfortunate that there is so little attention paid to other racial and ethnic groups. The author reviews recent research showing that black children are much more likely to show a preference or liking for their own race now than was the case in earlier research. The author provides a thorough, research based discussion of important and often controversial issues such as the development of racial attitudes and identity, race and school achievement, and multicultural education. The author ends with a strong statement of the possible role of schools in facing and dealing with racism, based on British experience. Multicultural education should not consist of an occasional unit on ethnic food, dances, or customs, as is often the case, the entire curriculum needs to include multiethnic materials. This book is a good starting point to achieve that goal.

Ouchi's (1981) management Theory Z, aimed at reducing the emphasis in the American economy on short-range interests, assumes that learning is the only source of human socialization. However, the theory's aims of individual worker fulfillment and increased aggregate productivity in a pluralistic society may be enhanced if possible instinctual contributions to behavior patterns are considered. Ideological snares in genetic determinism and cultural determinism are described, and an attempt is made to depolarize these alternatives. Basic ideas about evolution and inheritance are explained briefly, with evidences from familial studies, interspecies studies, and brain research. Because societies as pluralistic as those in the US are historically unusual, achieving a dynamic equilibrium of multiethnic integration that spans generations requires an unusually creative and predictive effort. Ouchi's notion of the natural mentoring relationship is a possible seed of such creative evolutionary change, suggesting a need for greater general dissemination of occupational information to help individual teachers and learners to discover each other.

The author's early work, particularly that examining social influence, led to the formulation of a multivariate model that takes into consideration background characteristics (e.g., SES, race), social influence variables, and personality. While much research into scholastic achievement has utilized causal modeling approaches, maximum likelihood analysis of structural equations provides a general approach that handles models that are not unidirectional, as well as random and nonrandom measurement errors. This methodology was used to examine the effect of social influence variables, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, in a multiethnic sample of 1,700 children from kindergarten through 6th grade. Contrary to expectations, results suggest that school variables exerted little if any influence on achievement. Rather, findings support a view of the schools as transmitting status differences developed early in life, in effect, perpetuating preexisting status and ability differences.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Reported systematic observations of 216 New Zealand men, equally divided among Maoris, Pacific Islanders, and Europeans, in 12 public bars throughout the Auckland metropolitan area. Alcohol consumption and the size, sex, and ethnic composition of their drinking groups were recorded at 5-min intervals from arrival to departure. Significant ethnic differences in consumption were documented. An alternative causal model to account for these differences, replicated within all 3 ethnic groups, emerged: Initial drinking group size determines subsequent group size, which determines time spent in the pub, which determines glasses of beer consumed. Drinking group size and time spent accounted for 69% of ethnic differences in consumption. Social rituals and cultural predispositions account for the relationships found in patterns of ethnic drinking. The more moderate levels of alcohol consumption observed among European drinkers are not the result of normal virtue but of learned patterns of interpersonal behavior that limit their participation in group drinking and limit the behavior of all drinkers who participate in such groups regardless of ethnic background. Also emphasized are the primary social-recreational role of the pub as a working man's club and the positive functions of drinking groups in a patron's total life adaptation.

Classroom status included academic and teacher- and peer-perceived status. Relationships between students' cultural background and the 3 variables were also examined. Ss were 165 2nd-4th graders in a school located in a lower socioeconomic, multiethnic community. The methodology included naturalistic observation, an analysis of the social meanings Ss attached to classroom language, and a comparison of Ss' classroom discourse with their sociolinguistic behavior in other settings (e.g., home and play). Results suggest that teacher praise may serve an instructional function for pupils who are the audience for the praise, while it functions more often as reinforcement for those who are the recipients of the praise.

A successful program at the University of California is described. It has as its goals the following: increasing the availability of counseling services to all students, particularly those who may need but do not avail themselves of these services (e.g., minority students); extending the reach and delivery of services, taking them directly to the students in the communities where they live and study and also acquainting them with the counseling center's resources; increasing the range of services offered by the center; and increasing opportunites for inter- and intraethnic communication. The approach is seen as an answer to immediate needs for counseling which cannot be met otherwise because of tightened university budgets which preclude the hiring of adequate professional counseling staff. It is also pointed out that most currently employed counselors were hired before college and universities developed a heightened ethnic awareness.
