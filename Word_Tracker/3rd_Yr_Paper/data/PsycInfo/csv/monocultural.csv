Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"On 5 February 2011, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, addressed the Munich Security Conference on the theme of 'radicalisation and Islamic extremism'. In his view this was the 'root cause of the problem' of 'home-grown terrorism' that allegedly thrived in an environment of passive tolerance, a liberalism gone wrong. The solution asserted Cameron was for British society (and by extension Western societies in general) to promote actively those values that allegedly defined it. What was needed was 'a much more active, muscular liberalism'. This was a curious suggestion given that such an idea harks back to a much earlier time when Britannia still ruled the waves. It might well be dismissed as a throwaway line, if it was not for the fact that it was presented as a solution to a specific problem allegedly rooted in the specific context of managing diasporas and their attendant identities. But what is this idea of 'muscular liberalism'? What does the resurrection of this mostly forgotten use of the idea of 'muscularity' signify in the current era? What might the Prime Minister's appeal to this sort of language mean in terms of illuminating the temper of our times? This paper aims to explore those questions. It is argued that the invocation of 'muscular liberalism' is more than a revealing discursive shift exposing the insecurities generated by the presence and political influence of diasporic cultures, as others have rightly noted. Beyond these insecurities lie even deeper fears, specifically that liberalism may be succeeding in empowering those who have previously been considered unimportant or unworthy of inclusion within the idea of British identity. Muscular liberalism, it is argued, is all about ensuring that the very values taken to be archetypically liberal are simultaneously applauded and neutralised.

Peer Reviewed Journal",,"This study provides new evidence concerning task specificity in creativity-examining through a cross-cultural perspective the extent to which performance in graphic versus verbal creativity tasks (domain specificity) and in divergent versus convergent creativity tasks (process specificity) are correlated. The relations between different creativity tasks in monocultural and multicultural samples of Chinese and French children were compared. Electronic versions of the Wallach and Kogan Creativity Test (WKCT, Wallach & Kogan, 1965; Lau & Cheung, 2010) and the Evaluation of Potential Creativity (EPoC; Lubart, Besancon, & Barbot, 2011; Barbot, Besancon, & Lubart, 2011) were used. Both measures showed satisfactory psychometric properties and cross-cultural structural validity. The results showed that culture has an impact on the structure of creative ability: It appeared that correlation patterns were different across Chinese and French groups and across monocultural and multicultural groups. Such results show that it is crucial to take task specificity into account when investigating the effect of culture on creativity. Indeed, our study implies that cultural differences that are found using one specific creativity task might not be automatically generalizable to all sorts of creativity tasks. Limitations are discussed and perspectives for future research on culture and task specificity in creativity are proposed.

This study aimed to enhance our understanding on the relationship between acculturation orientation and second language (L2) learning. It generated two conceptual models to describe how cultural identification affects language learning as hypothesized in different theories on identity and L2 learning and tested these two hypothesized models in the immigration context of Hong Kong. A survey was conducted among a group of senior high school South Asian minority students on their learning of the language of the host culture, Chinese, to provide the basis for comparison. It was found that the students mainly adopted the bicultural/integration orientation and that bicultural orientation was the optimal acculturation orientation for learning Chinese. Bicultural orientation influenced the participants' Chinese language learning outcome through impacting psychosocial well-being and engagement with the target language and community. The findings suggest that we need to take both linguistic and psychosocial adjustment factors into consideration when conceptualizing the role of identity in L2 learning. Furthermore, this study cautions us against a context-independent stance toward the utility of assimilation for language learning.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The purpose of this chapter is to provide recommendations to teacher educators in terms of structuring service-learning experiences in ways that promote beliefs and help preservice teachers develop the skills necessary to be effective with English language learners (ELLs). Teacher education is at a crucial juncture as the demographic makeup of current students is changing rapidly, resulting in a need to reexamine teacher education in light of these shifts. For example, the percentage of minority students in K-12 public schools increased from 33% in 1990 to 46% in 2010, whereas only 16.5% of teachers reported belonging to minority groups in 2007-2008, and most do not have the experience of becoming proficient in a second language, the kind of experience that may help them relate to the learning histories of their students. This disparity raises concern about the limited abilities of those with monocultural and monolingual experiences when they view and value the perspectives of their students from other cultural backgrounds. Additionally, many preservice teachers believe they are not as capable of instructing students who differ from themselves in terms of race or language as they do those from their own cultural backgrounds.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Poland-a country situated between eastern and western Europe. Polish people are a nation torn between eastern emotionalism, impulsivity, and western rationalism, cautiousness-a buffer between eastern and western Europe. It is a country whose identity is constantly changing; formerly multicultural (including Poles, Ukrainians, Belamsians, Jews, Tatars, Lithuanians, and Armenians) it is nowadays monocultural. Poland is a Catholic state situated between the eastern Orthodox Church and western Protestantism. Geographically located in the center of Europe, for centuries it had to defend its borders, a country that still remembers its past power that used to reach from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The same country that was later geographically annihilated, absorbed, balancing between existence and nonexistence. ""A seasonal state (saisonstaat)""-as Germans ironically called it after the World War One. The theme of constantly redefining its self-image and re-establishing its borders seems to be a leitmotiv of Polish history. Settling the Polish borders after World War One, and the fact that the borders were approved by Germany in 1989, constitutes a very important factor in the current image of Poles and Poland. Modern Poland and Polish people are like a newly discovered Self that derives energy from its clear definition and from memories of its difficult past that remind Poles how bad things can get. Can Poland and Poles be compared to a patient who has won a fight for his own identity within his own borders? A patient who has recovered from borderline syndrome that has lasted for centuries? In the following, we would like to discuss whether and to what extent the metaphor of a borderline personality-with its weak self, a tendency to split objects into good, idealized, and bad, devalued-is an adequate illustration of the historical process of building the identity of Poland and of its people.

Peer Reviewed Journal",,"The influences of globalization have permeated various aspects of life in contemporary society, from technical innovations, economic development, and lifestyles, to communication patterns. The present research proposed a construct termed global orientation to denote individual differences in the psychological processes of acculturating to the globalizing world. It encompasses multicultural acquisition as a proactive response and ethnic protection as a defensive response to globalization. Ten studies examined the applicability of global orientations among majority and minority groups, including immigrants and sojourners, in multicultural and relatively monocultural contexts, and across Eastern and Western cultures. Multicultural acquisition is positively correlated with both independent and interdependent self-construals, bilingual proficiency and usage, and dual cultural identifications. Multicultural acquisition is promotion-focused, while ethnic protection is prevention-focused and related to acculturative stress. Global orientations affect individuating and modest behavior over and above multicultural ideology, predict overlap with outgroups over and above political orientation, and predict psychological adaptation, sociocultural competence, tolerance, and attitudes toward ethnocultural groups over and above acculturation expectations/strategies. Global orientations also predict English and Chinese oral presentation performance in multilevel analyses and the frequency and pleasantness of intercultural contact in cross-lagged panel models. We discuss how the psychological study of global orientations contributes to theory and research on acculturation, cultural identity, and intergroup relations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Studies indicate that Latino immigrant youths engage in a wide range of sophisticated literacy practices outside of school that are often transnational, crossing various linguistic, cultural, and social spaces. However, Latino immigrant youths drop out of U.S. schools at disproportional rates, suggesting that their literacy practices are not recognized or valued by the educational system. This collective case study investigated the range, form, and purpose of the Out-of-School literacies of four Latina/o adolescent English learners who are new arrivals. Findings demonstrated that the most prevalent out-of-School literacies that the participants practice take place on the social networking site Facebook, in their workplaces, and through entertainment media sources. A cross-case analysis suggests that the literacy practices in these spaces have unique and purposeful roles for the individuals that allow them to connect to their home countries and maintain their Latina/o identities. Additionally, the participants use their out-of-school literacy practices to acquire English, support themselves, and establish a place to succeed. The five aforementioned spaces that their Facebook, workplace, and entertainment literacy practices fill are virtually absent from their in-school literacies. This study suggests that literacy pedagogy must not continue to impose a narrow monolingual, monocultural, monoliterate, and monomodal view of Latina/o immigrant students that essentially divests them of their greatest resources. Their literacy practices demonstrate that they are emerging as multilingual, multiliterate, and multicultural transnationals who competently engage in multimodal means of communication.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Indigenous peoples have poorer health outcomes than their non-indigenous counterparts and this applies to cancer outcomes for Maori in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Differential access to and quality of healthcare contributes to poorer survival rates for Maori. This research provides insight into some of the mechanisms that hinder and facilitate care access. Thirty four people who had undergone cancer treatment (19 Maori and 15 non-Maori) were interviewed by two Maori researchers. The analysis of the interview transcripts was informed by membership categorization analysis. This form of analysis attends to the categories that are used and the activities and characteristics associated with those categories. From this analysis it is argued that the classical patient role, or sick role, inadequately captures the kind of role that some Maori take in relation to their healthcare. Maori can also have culturally specific family (whanau) influences and a greater draw towards alternative approaches to healthcare. Dissonant roles contribute to a different experience for Maori. A better understanding of the categories and roles that are relevant to those who have cancer provides opportunities to attenuate the monocultural impacts of healthcare.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The link between multicultural experience and creativity is consistently supported by many empirical studies. However, most of these results are limited to adult participants with foreign living experience. The present study extended previous studies and investigated the positive relationship between multicultural experience and creativity in Taiwan young adolescents living in binational families. With more than 700 young adolescents, the results showed that young adolescents from binational families had parents with lower socioeconomic status than monocultural families. However, young adolescents from binational families performed better on creativity tests (fluency, flexibility, and originality) than those from monocultural families. In addition, when variables of family background and young adolescents' personalities were controlled for, the effect of binational families on creativity remained. The implications for research on multicultural families and young adolescents' creative performance are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The current study examined the structural composition of the communication networks of Korean immigrants' ethnic church community, which became the main sources of their social capital. The study measured the effect of their network characteristics (i.e., size, diversity, and centrality) on individuals' monocultural and intercultural orientations. A total of seven hypotheses, drawn from Smith's (1999) theoretical propositions on intercultural communication networks, were tested. An organizational member survey (N =178) of a Korean immigrant church was used to construct the whole network of the organization. Additionally, the relationships between major constructs (i.e., social capital and intercultural development) were analyzed with hierarchical regression modeling. Results suggested that network diversity had a positive influence on intercultural orientation while network centrality had a positive influence on monocultural orientation among Korean immigrant church members. Network size was positively associated with network diversity after controlling for the effect of English proficiency. Among the three groups of Korean immigrant occupations (i.e., professional, unskilled labor, unemployed), the professional group and the unskilled group showed a significant difference in their intercultural orientation. The research findings suggest that regardless of an individual immigrant's will, over-embeddedness in intra-cultural communication networks can increase one's ethonocentric cultural attitudes and beliefs.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The traditional model of literacy coaching makes great sense in monocultural and monolingual settings; however, in multicultural and linguistically diverse settings, we suggest a broadened approach in order to achieve culturally responsive coaching. This chapter provides two case examples of developing literacy coaches who learn about others through stories and experiences presented with the ABCs of Cultural Understanding framework. In particular, we examine how the ABCs model helps literacy coaches learn to work effectively in diverse settings. Based on experiences with in-service teachers and those who are in the process of becoming literacy coaches, all of the components in a traditional literacy coaching model need to revolve around the cultural and linguistic needs of communities and schools. While there is a strong rationale for literacy coaching positions, and guidelines that define effective literacy coaching, what is often missing is a conversation about literacy coaches' abilities to talk across race and class lines. Specifically, to be effective when relating to teachers, students, administrators, and the community; literacy coaches must be able to have cross-cultural conversations to learn with and from others.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article describes some valuable resources, especially those available on the web, which can assist in conducting cross-national survey research. Cross-national survey research is a complex and challenging endeavor. Designing a reliable and valid comparative study is notably more difficult than constructing a single monolingual/monocultural survey. Besides the whole array of components that encompass total-survey error in one survey, there is a parallel set of comparison errors that apply in cross-national surveys. Likewise, comparative analysis is complicated by these comparison errors, and even well-conducted comparative surveys may produce erroneous results due to failing to achieve functional equivalence at the design, collection, and/ or analysis stages. Even locating cross-national data for secondary analysis can be a challenge. The best overall resource for conducting cross-national survey research is the Cross-Cultural Survey Guidelines (CCSG). CCSG is frequently updated, and a comprehensive revision is underway with release scheduled for 2015. Besides the major archives and the catalogues and search tools designed to access their holdings, there are the websites maintained by individual cross-national programs.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article examines how essentializing ideologies of language and identity in Toronto's Portuguese ethnic market, constructed as monolingual and monocultural within the larger mainstream market of English-speaking Canada, provide the background for humorous sociolinguistic performances that playfully acknowledge, reproduce, and challenge ethnolinguistic stratification. After more than sixty years, the dominant spaces of the local Portuguese market continue to exclude most Portuguese-Canadian youth by rarely legitimizing the use of English, bilingual code-switching, or 'broken' or 'Azorean' Portuguese. By choosing YouTube as a space in which to engage audiences in ideologies of language and identity through performances of sociolinguistic caricatures, three young Portuguese-Canadian amateur comedians negotiate sociolinguistic boundaries with an ambivalent agency. The mocking performances are legitimized by the performers' in-group status and reveal, among other things, how a stigmatized variety of Azorean Portuguese and certain ethnolinguistic stereotypes can be reap-propriated and reinforced relative to sociolinguistic hierarchies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article explores how Islamic values influence management and business practice in Morocco with a view to a new understanding of how one of the global, socio-political tides of the early twenty-first century is now beginning to make itself felt commercially. An interpretivist approach, coupled with access to a rich and hitherto inaccessible mix of diverse and highly placed participants, allows the authors to augment extant research with a vivid rendering of the lived reality of Islamic management practice. And in consequence, sweeping monocultural generalisations about national character and practice can be refined into a nuanced and layered analysis of actual management behaviour. In order to understand how Islamic values influence management practice the findings unravel what has hitherto been presented in the extant literature as a Gordian Knot of complex influences. By putting the voices of participants 'centre-stage' the Gordian Knot is replaced by the metaphor of the Arabesque, a Moorish artform typically comprising motifs of flowing branches, leaves and scroll work all interlaced and entwined. Just as these typical motifs are ever-present in the form of the Arabesque yet take on a unique pattern in each individual depiction, so it is with the characteristics which influence management practice in Morocco. The principal motifs elicited from participants include: 'living' Islam (including the interaction of Islam and personal beliefs, alongside the influence of kinship); Islam versus Moroccan Islam (the national culture's ingestion of a religion); national characteristics of family and patriarchy (including the support that employees expect from their managers); socio-economic factors, in particular education and gender (life experiences including education and the home); and foreign influences (the impact of Western colonialism). This research identifies that these principal motifs are ever-present in their influence on management practice, yet in each individual's case the pattern of such influence bears the unique imprint of the individual manager's own religiosity and character.

It investigates how modern nation-states integrate immigrant men and women on fundamentally different terms and how gender politics shape the integration process. To date, the study of immigration in both France and the US has served as a window onto restrictive public policies and exclusivist public debates. Meanwhile, social histories of immigrant groups depict monocultural communities in which women feature simply as occasional faces in a foreign-born crowd. In both veins of scholarship, categories of race, ethnicity and nationality take precedence despite the fact that a significant number of immigrant women and families settled in interwar France during a period of acute population crisis. This project is the first to address the importance of gender, family and reproduction in immigration and integration processes against this historical backdrop. The dramatic ""crisis of depopulation"" that gripped France at the end of the nineteenth century and sharpened considerably after the First World War ironically opened up a rare moment of national inclusion for immigrants. Faced with the alarming reality of falling birthrates, a variety of state and social actors welcomed foreign-born men and women to interwar France. Employers, labor recruiters, social workers, and local and state officials enacted populationist policies on behalf of immigrant wives and mothers, often at the expense of foreign husbands. For their own part, immigrant women turned the state's benevolent paternalism to their advantage, lobbying persistently - and successfully - for generous welfare provisions. By contrast, immigrant bachelors and husbands found state officials less receptive to their demands. Thus, while the state integrated foreigners, it did so through the twin logics of disciplinary paternalism and supportive maternalism geared towards immigrant men and women, respectively. Although interaction with state representatives significantly shaped working-class immigrant existence, the foreign-born spent most of their lives on the fringes of officialdom, in neighborhoods throughout France that were growing increasingly multicultural between the wars. Immigrant women in particular joined in a lively apartment-house and neighborhood culture that bound French and foreign locals together. Though they often served as the connective tissue of neighborhood life, their role has received no attention in the literature to date. Over time, they adopted patterns of employment, marriage, fertility, and childrearing indistinguishable to those of their French neighbors. Thus, a particularly female form of mutual aid and neighborhood association functioned as foreign women's primary path to acculturation. To capture this multi-faceted story, I draw on municipal statistics, laws, naturalization dossiers, census reports, police files, court cases and social service records as well as interwar fiction, memoirs and films. Through this unique combination of materials, I uncover supportive state policies directed towards women while underscoring immigrant women's own agency in acculturation processes at state and local levels. I also show that immigrant men, although incorporated into the nation via the familial form, received a comparatively cooler welcome from state and social actors. In the process, this project contributes to the transnational literatures on immigration, gender and sexuality, and the welfare state.

Thus, it is likely that many Americans identify with at least two cultures, that of the mainstream United States culture, and their ethnic culture from which they came, making them bicultural. However, current understanding of the impact of biculturalism on psychological functioning is quite limited in scope, as few studies have examined this association longitudinally or considered the moderating role of the cultural environment. The present study proposed to take a more comprehensive approach in understanding the consequences of biculturalism on psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, and substance abuse symptoms) among Mexican American adolescents, as they belong to one of largest and fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States (US Census, 2013). The present study had two major goals. The first was to examine the influence of biculturalism on depression, anxiety, and substance abuse symptoms longitudinally over the course of two years. It was hypothesized that overall, biculturalism will lead to less depression, anxiety, and substance abuse symptoms. The results partially supported these predictions. For males, biculturalism was related to significantly fewer anxiety symptoms, but not for females. Further, no main effects of biculturalism were found for depression and substance abuse for males or females. The second goal of the study was to examine the potential moderating role of the cultural environment on the influence of biculturalism on mental health symptoms. It was hypothesized that bicultural individuals will exhibit less mental health symptoms in bicultural environments (person-environment fit) compared to more monocultural individuals (person-environment misfit). However, no differences are expected to emerge between bicultural and monocultural individuals in monocultural environments, as both groups should be well adapted in these settings. The results did not fully support these predictions. Though, biculturalism for male adolescents was related to significantly fewer anxiety symptoms in home environments where parents reported moderate degrees of biculturalism, and females' biculturalism was related to significantly fewer depression symptoms in neighborhood environments that were relatively bicultural; no effects of biculturalism were found in environments that were the most bicultural. The implications of the findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).",,"biculturalism, mental health, cultural environment, anxiety","*Anxiety

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Identity development is conceptualized as a series of distinct stages in the developmental pathway, including acquisition of self-knowledge, establishment of independence and personal continuity, and acquisition of a sense of affiliation. For those negotiating more than one cultural/racial/ethnic identity, a unique set of stages may be undertaken in the development of identity, particularly during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Although the sociocultural factors that shape identity development are relatively well-conceptualized, much less well understood are the biological mechanisms that facilitate identity development throughout the lifespan for both majority and minority group members. This chapter discusses sociocultural and biological pathways of identity development through the lens of cultural neuroscience, elucidating how dynamic culture-biology interactions shape the development of social identity in majority and minority group members and the etiology underlying adaptive social development in people living in monocultural and diverse multicultural communities.

Authored Book",,"(from the cover) While social identity challenges probably confront all school administrators, the authors focus on a doubly marginalized leadership population-Black female principals-whose experiences are rarely tapped. Based on lessons from this study and the literature reviewed, the authors think that leadership preparation programs should give prospective administrators opportunities to gain knowledge and develop skills relevant to navigating their leadership identities. In the age of accountability, and with the pressures placed on the education system to ensure the success of all students, school leaders are under constant scrutiny. The appearance, speech, body language, and interactions of principals with students, parents, teachers, and community members are dissected. Stretching to satisfy expectations, many principals find themselves trying to conform to a predefined image. Work pressures like these prove immeasurably intense for many Black women. Society has subscribed to certain beliefs about different groups, and these beliefs affect the roles, responsibilities, and identities of the individuals. They can have a positive or negative influence. Many principals have created professional identities that they have fine-tuned and learned to steer Trial and error has helped them learn identity-fitting techniques, while other principals may still be learning how to effectively manage people, address supporters and nonsupporters, and be politically savvy. Regardless of how they develop their identity, principals work toward inventing and branding themselves, fulfilling public identities (e.g., caregiver) and trying out new identities, such as commander-and-chief. Black female principals must navigate their identities as bicultural beings with different stakeholder groups and within work spaces that are traditionally geared to monocultural White males.

That divide also affects the Church in America, which remains 93 percent monocultural. Although multi-ethnic congregations represent a growing phenomenon in the United States, they often face the challenges of racial and political tensions that threaten their unity. Congregations that successfully address these challenges carry the potential to help heal the nation's racial divisions. This project considered the challenges that confront many multi-racial congregations and offered practical solutions. A review of biblical and theological sources indicated that God redeemed the Church to serve as a new kind of community commissioned to reflect His inclusive love for all humanity and to gather a multi-ethnic body of believers for His glory. This richly diverse Church enjoys a unity centered in Jesus Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit, and expressed in koinonia, a bond stronger than racial or political distinctions. This project created a small group experience, Journey toward Koinonia, a series of six weekly meetings involving seven Black and seven White members of Trinity Church in Columbia, South Carolina. The Journey utilized teaching and guided dialogue within a spiritual and relational atmosphere to facilitate greater understanding and enable genuine koinonia across racial lines. A qualitative assessment indicated the effectiveness of such an approach for bridging the racial-political divide in a local church.

This qualitative study explored the perceptions of working relationships among multicultural team members in international mission agencies based on their linguistic and cultural backgrounds. The purpose of this research was to identify people's perceptions constructed by their linguistic and cultural backgrounds as to what it means to build good working relationships in multicultural team settings. Literature bases include linguistic relativism, cultural differences in the cognitive process and theories on various cultural dimensions. The study was conducted by interviewing 29 participants who are working in multicultural teams in the Caucasus from 11 nationalities. Eight mother tongue languages were represented among the participants. Members of six international organizations participated in the study. The study inquired in what ways linguistic and cultural backgrounds influenced the team members' perceptions on working relationships. The findings suggest that multicultural teams are monocultural in function, namely, American or Western at best. Multicultural teams are multicultural in their demographic representation but monocultural in their operation. Linguistic hegemony is prevalent among multicultural team members, as the English language is often assumed to be the team language. The findings also suggest that the perceptions of what it means to build working relationships are different based on members' linguistic and cultural backgrounds. As a result, people from monocultural contexts can learn new ways of thinking and behaving from multicultural teams without becoming assimilationists. Some recommendations are proposed to mission agencies based on the findings.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The article examines two key concepts in research on policy borrowing and lending that are often used to explain why and how educational reforms travel across national boundaries: reception and translation. The studies on reception analyse the political, economic, and cultural reasons that account for the attractiveness of a reform from elsewhere. Translation, in turn, captures the act of local adaptation, modification, or re-framing of an imported reform. Strikingly, in most cases the act of policy borrowing is deterritorialized and draws on broadly defined international standards or ""best practices"". The exceptions are references to the league leaders in international student achievement tests such as, most recently, Singapore, Finland, and Shanghai. The article makes the argument that policy analysts in other countries only emulate the system features of league leaders if it fits their own domestic policy agenda. Furthermore, there is a new body of research emerging in comparative education that investigates the country-specific projections into the educational systems of the league leaders. Finally, the article points to the ""yes, but ..."" phenomenon in cases where there is resistance to learn, adopt or borrow from league leaders. It is in such moments of resistance to change that policy makers tend to highlight fundamental differences by insisting that the contexts are not sufficiently comparable to learn a useful lesson: Finland is too monocultural, Shanghai too urban, and Singapore relies too much on private tutoring to be relevant for lesson drawing.

The authors tear us away from our monocultural, ethnocentric perspectives in the United States by pointing out the stark differences in suicidal patterns in different cultures This book underscores the reality that behavior has many determinants. It also highlights some universal drivers of risky behavior, such as social disorganization, cultural conflict, and the breakdown of the family. However, protective factors, may mitigate these pressures. In the conclusion, the editors cite 3 recent books concluding that ""there is no sound research evidence that psychiatric disorders are caused by dysfunctional neurotransmitter, systems in the brain, and second, that psychiatric medications are no better than active placebos in helping patients.""

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article examines issues pertaining to content instruction in English in a Japanese higher education institution. It notes that Japan's economic success in the latter part of the twentieth century was achieved with Japanese as the medium of instruction and observes that in terms of ideology and cultural politics at least, there are inherent contradictions with recent moves to have academic courses taught in English. Dominant motifs marking attitudes and practices relating to language, culture and to Japan's dealings with the world beyond Japanese shores are initially examined vis-a-vis the larger situ of a Japan that continues to live down the consequences of post-war occupation and the conservative politics that ensued, circumstances that have bolstered narratives of Japan as a predominantly monolingual and monocultural nation. This is followed by a discussion on how various ideological as well as macro- and micro-political forces bear on the use of English for content instruction. Finally, it will be noted that the present state of affairs calls for deeper thought and critical scrutiny - if recent initiatives towards having more English in higher education are not to be found for superficiality or even a lack of sincerity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The synchronized terror attacks on July 22, 2011 was the worst politically motivated assault in post-WW2 Norway. To the perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik, 22/7 was a ""marketing operation,"" designed to draw attention to his compendium, 2083: A European Declaration of Independence. While Breivik acted alone, his political philosophy is far from unique. Through a detailed analysis of the compendium's content, identifying the original authors whose texts Breivik used but did not always acknowledge, this essay discusses the political traditions that informed the assailant's worldview: Islamophobia (anti-Muslim racism), cultural conservative nationalism, antifeminism, and selected elements of White Power thought, far Right evangelical theology, and the Knights Templar tradition, all permeated by romantic male warrior ideals. The stunning violence of July 22 was a hyper-masculine performative act aimed at producing a heroic avant-garde of nationalist warriors who will rise to purge Europe from the corrupting influence of its internal enemies and defeat its external enemies. Through the cleansing fire of the civil war, he believes that a reborn Europe will arise to reclaim its ordained position of glory as the world's leading civilization. In the final analysis, Breivik's political philosophy may thus be recognized as a 21st-century articulation of the fascist legacy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article reviews cognitive interviewing (CI) as a survey pretesting method in cross-national settings. Particularly, semi-structured cognitive interviewing (SSCI) using direct probing is advocated when CI involves multiple countries/languages. Four major groups of fundamental issues are discussed: conceptual, measurement, procedural, and practical. The conceptual issues relate to the nature of interview data, potential sources of problems, and sample size. Next, it is shown how the SSCI method can be used to informally evaluate validity, reliability, and cross-cultural equivalence. This is followed by the procedural steps and the practical issues in implementing cross-national SSCI studies. Some methodological and practical limitations are also noted. The article concludes by highlighting the implications of using the cross-national CI method in a single-country context with multiple immigrant/cultural/language groups or in monocultural settings.

Technology has further afforded immigrant youth the opportunity to develop transnational capabilities which are rare in the mainstream population, yet needed in the 21st century of global connectedness. However, Latino immigrant youth drop out of school at disproportional rates, suggesting that their literacy practices are not recognized or valued by the educational system. Using a New Literacy Studies perspective that recognizes multiple literacies that are meaningful within their sociocultural traditions, this collective case study investigated the range, form, and purpose of the out-of-school literacies of four Latina/o adolescent English Learners who are new arrivals. The qualitative methodology employed constructivist interviews, digital and actual artifacts, and observations. Findings demonstrated that the most prevalent out-of-school literacies the participants practice take place on the social networking site of Facebook, in their workplaces, and through the entertainment media sources of music and television. A cross-case analysis suggests that the literacy practices in these spaces have unique and purposeful roles for the individuals that allow them to connect to their home countries and maintain their Latina/o identities. Additionally, the participants use their out-of-school literacy practices to acquire English, support themselves, and establish a place to succeed. The five aforementioned spaces that their Facebook, workplace, and entertainment literacy practices fill are virtually absent from their in-school literacies. This study suggests literacy pedagogy and research must not continue to impose a narrow monolingual, monocultural, monoliterate, and monomodal view of Latina/o immigrant students which essentially divests them of their greatest resources. Their literacy practices demonstrate that they are transnational, transcultural, emergent bilinguals who competently engage in multimodal means of communication across multiple linguistic, cultural, social, and geographic borders. Educators must reconceptualize school-based literacy to account for the ways immigrant youth make meaning outside of school to provide them a more equitable education that will nurture their transnational skills needed in modern society.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Building upon recent research that defines psychological development as a continuous process of sense-making situated within a cultural and historical context, this paper explores how culturally diverse youth growing up in New York City use evaluative language to enact relational complexity as they make sense of technologically mediated interpersonal interactions with their peers. Forty-four individuals (ages 15-20) participated in a quasi-experimental research workshop that engaged them in the process of sense-making by asking them to write projective narratives toward a vignette depicting text-massage mediated interpersonal interaction embedded among monocultural and bicultural group of peers. Data analyses focus on evaluative devices used by youth and manifest the relational flexibility of sense-making by immigrant youth and their U.S. born peers across diverse relational dimensions. Results suggest that immigrant youth are able to coordinate diverse ways of interpreting interpersonal interactions across relational dimensions, manifest by varied use of logical/hypothetical, causal and affective evaluative devices. In contrast U.S. born youth largely use same frequency of evaluative devices across two relational dimensions. Statistical analysis highlights the use of affect in projective narratives by exploring a discursive learning hypothesis: that higher use of emotions in the process of sense-making by U.S. born youth gradually scaffolds the use of emotions in narrative by immigrant youth.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Today's diverse society often includes culturally rich environments that contain cues pertaining to more than one culture. These cultural cues can shape cognitive processes, such as creativity. Recent evidence shows that bicultural experience enhances creativity, and that for culture-related domains, this effect is particularly evident among biculturals who blend their two cultural identities. The present study tested whether enhanced creativity among more blended biculturals was due to increased idea generation (i.e., ideational fluency). Moreover, the authors tested whether these effects generalized to noncultural domains, which may indicate that bicultural experience enhances creativity in broader arenas. One hundred seventy-seven Chinese Americans completed a creativity task in either a monocultural or bicultural context (manipulated via Chinese or American symbols or both). Greater bicultural identity blendedness predicted domain-general creativity in bicultural but not in monocultural contexts, and this was mediated by ideational fluency. Implications for enhancing creativity in our diverse society are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The ways in which national prototypes are defined constitute an important symbolic resource for maintaining hierarchy between groups within society. Two studies examined how New Zealanders downplayed or emphasized inclusionary versus exclusionary features of the national prototype. Study 1 tested a structural equation model indicating that people high in Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) rated monocultural features that best fit an exclusionary (Anglo/European) ideal as characteristic of the national prototype (citizenship and ancestry, rugby/sporting culture). Simultaneously, people high in SDO also rated pluralistic features that were inclusive as less important for the national prototype (cultural awareness, liberal democratic values; n = 95). Study 2 replicated and extended these opposing effects to show that they held controlling for Right-Wing Authoritarianism and patriotism (n = 258). People high in the competitive-driven motivation for group-based hierarchy and inequality position representations of the national prototype in ways that privilege some groups over others in defining who constitutes a 'true' citizen. This likely helps legitimize various subtle discriminatory and exclusionary practices directed toward recent immigrant groups, to the extent that such groups are seen as not really 'belonging' to the nation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In a series of interviews with leading cross-cultural management (CCM) educators, we examine the state of the CCM field within business education. We invited eight prominent scholars and executive educators to consider the following main questions: What is the role of cross-cultural management in business curricula? What challenges do we face teaching this material? How can we create an engaged learning environment with the diverse audiences we encounter in our classrooms, and what theoretical frameworks best support these efforts? Last what is the future of cross-cultural management education? What changes and challenges can we expect? The learnings that emerged from our interviews are grouped around three main themes: the content of what we teach, our understanding of audiences with whom we work and their evolving expectations of cross-cultural management education, and the role, preparation, background and assumptions of the educators. This series of interviews contributes to highlight current trends in cross-cultural management education: a shift in content from knowledge to conditions of knowledge creation, a transition from monocultural audiences toward biculturals and global cosmopolitans, and finally, educators' changing responsibility from providing knowledge to developing and honing responsible, tolerant, and resilient global citizens.

Likewise, research has demonstrated that culture influences the way in which anger is triggered and expressed. A study conducted by Kassinove and colleagues (1997) evaluated patterns of anger episodes between Russian and American participants. The results revealed similarities and differences between and within the two different cultures. Overall, an extensive amount of research has been dedicated to evaluating anger differences between cultures. A few studies, however, have examined how bicultural individuals express and experience anger when compared to the two monocultural groups. The present study investigated the differences in anger experiences and expressions among Russian, Russian-American, and American male college students. A total of 144 male college students participated in this study; out of which 50 participants were Russian college students, 49 were Russian-American college students, and 45 were American college students. For the purpose of this study, three separate hypotheses were proposed. The first hypothesis is that there are differences in emotional responses, particularly the intensity of emotions, among the three different cultural groups. The second hypothesis is that there are differences in behavioral responses among the three different cultural groups. The third hypothesis is that there are differences in thoughts among the three different cultural groups. These hypotheses were evaluated using an anger questionnaire, which focused on three different components of anger (emotions, behaviors, and thoughts). The results of the study supported these hypotheses. Significant differences were found among the Russian, Russian-American, and American participants when it came to experiencing, expressing, and thinking about their most recent anger episodes.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The Horn of Africa, and specifically Somalia, is now being recognized as one of the worst places for women to live (Abdi, C. M. (2005). In limbo: Dependency, insecurity and identity amongst Somali refugees in Dadaab camps, Refuge: Canada's Periodical on Refugees, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 6-14; The Guardian (2011). Somali refugees abandon babies at Dadaab camp, The Guardian. Available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/ world/2011/aug/14/somalia-refugees-abandon-babies-dadaab; The Guardian (2011) Afghanistan worst place in the world for women, but India in top five. The Guardian. Available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/15/worst-place-womenafghanistan- india). Somali women refugees, particularly those living in the South of Somalia, face heightened possibility of rape and sexual humiliation, and are subject to everchanging religious restrictions and punishments (Abdi, C. M. (2005). In limbo: Dependency, insecurity and identity amongst Somali refugees in Dadaab camps, Refuge: Canada's Periodical on Refugees, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 6-14; The New York Times, 2011). Some of the latest religious restrictions are that bras are forbidden and women must purchase specific clothing from stores owned by religious leaders. Also, pregnancy out of wedlock, which includes pregnancy as a result of rape, is forbidden and punishable by stoning (BBC (2009, November). Somali woman stoned for adultery. Available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8366197.stm). A recent 2011 Sharia law bans unrelated men and women from shaking hands, walking or talking together in public. The consequence of disobeying is punishment by public flogging (BBC (2011, January). Somalia's al-Shabab bans mixed-sex handshake. Available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/ news/world-africa-12138627). After settling in Canada, these past traumas intersect with the resettlement challenges faced by Somali women refugees. This often produces healthrelated issues that women struggle to overcome-within a monocultural medical system that is not always responsive to their needs (Danso, 2002; Galabuzi, G. E. (2002, November). Social exclusion. A paper and presentation given at The Social Determinants of Health across the Life-Span Conference, Toronto, ON; Bokore, 2009). This paper explores the connections between trauma and resettlement in the lives of Somali-Canadian women, and how this can in turn effect the next generation via 'intergenerational trauma'. Through personal experience, community-based conversations and existent trauma research, I will then outline how social workers can respond to this unique nexus of needs.

Our study explores how immigrant youth in a multicultural city view and use identities to negotiate at school, with peers, and with family. Participants (N = 20) were adolescents (12 -18 years) living in Geneva, Switzerland. Findings show that youths' peer networks are multicultural and school and home are more likely to be monocultural. We can apply these findings to future research designed to ask youth about their identities within different contexts as well as to incorporate intercultural and multicultural identities into identity theories.

Only a limited number of interracial children from those marriages currently attend the extremely homogenous South Korean schools yet, but more are expected to do so in the near future. This dissertation explores the process of foreign mothers' involvement in their children's education, particularly their access to, and use of cultural and social capital. I present a, conceptual framework, ""The process of foreign mothers' involvement in their children's education,"" To help understand these mothers' experiences regarding their children's education Twenty foreign mothers were interviewed in a rural community in South Korea about their social and cultural capital surrounding their home-based and school-based involvement in their children's education. Social events that foreign mothers attended were also observed, and ten additional people were interviewed including foreign mothers' spouses, friends, neighbors, and Korean language teachers. Findings show that most foreign mothers took the roles of the major caregivers' and educators' in their family, had high aspirations regarding their children's education, and were therefore willing to support them. Frequently, however, foreign mothers were perceived by both themselves and their family members as incapable of properly engaging in their children's education. Given their immigrant background, their knowledge of Korean language and culture were presumed to be insufficient. Nonetheless, they were expected to be involved in their children's education in the manner of South Korean mothers. Their original languages and cultures were often considered irrelevant for their children's development. Accordingly, most foreign mothers appeared to be frustrated with the standard of parenting that required them to emulate South Korean mothers. The exception to this was a minority who refused the monolingual and monocultural ideologies or who were already proficiency in Korean language and culture at the time of immigration. Most foreign mothers' social relationships were restricted within the boundaries of geographic proximity or the same ethnic groups and rarely included native South Koreans, which explains their limited information channels. In some cases, Korean language teachers and families acted as bridges for mothers to Korean society. Findings increase the understanding of immigrant mothers' experiences in South Korea and provide important education policy implications.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Current knowledge about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) families has developed mainly in a Euro-American (Westernized) cultural context, which, although characterized by diversity, represents a fairly monocultural perspective on LGBT families. When examining research from a non-Western perspective, factors such as globalization, geographical location, social and cultural frameworks regarding race, language, and religion, and localized understandings of gender, sex, and sexuality need to be recognized. This chapter briefly explores the historical background of same-sex-oriented people within non-Westernized cultures, to account for the possible presence and existence of LGBT-parent families, as well as to provide a background against which the diversity and complexities of same-sex practices in various cultures influence the way LGBT families should be considered. After this overview, research from five regions is explored along significant signposts of gender, heteronormativity, the legal and political framework, and religious influences.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"An ethic of care acknowledges the centrality of the role of caring relationships in moral education. Care ethics requires a conception of 'care' that differs from the quotidian use of the word. In order to teach care ethics more effectively, this article discusses four interrelated ways that teachers' understandings of care differ from care ethics: (1) conflating the term of reference 'care' with its quotidian use; (2) overlooking the challenge of developing caring relationships; (3) tending toward monocultural understandings of care; and (4) separating affect and intellect. Awareness of these conceptions of care supports teacher educators to teach care ethics in more meaningful and relevant ways. We explore stories and their dramatization as a medium to facilitate effective and in-depth teaching of care ethics.

The subjects were five males and six females, ages 20 to 25 years old; all but one participated in two in-depth interviews over a one and a half year period. The study found the majority of the participants felt more Italian than American wherever they were in the world. They all dealt with issues of acceptance and fitting in, and felt a little different from their monocultural Italian and American peers. By late adolescence they had evolved to experience the differences as positive rather than polarizing. All of the participants were bilingual and able to alternate or switch languages and/or ethnocultural identities to adapt to various contexts and situations. Environmental influences were powerful, found in themes of family interculture, relationships with peers, language use, lifestyle, passage of time, identifying events and significant people, and educational pathways. The study addresses the advantages, drawbacks, and developmental challenges of growing up bicultural. Some participants reported that their self-positioning evolved from bicultural to a third culture, or what one participant described as a meta intercultural identity. Implications for future research, social work practice, and parenting are outlined.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The aim of this research was to explore the impact of independent and interdependent self-construals on relations between work and family demands (workload and family conflict) and work/family conflict (WFC and FWC). Three hundred and ten Taiwanese employees were surveyed at two times (6 weeks apart) using structured questionnaires. For Taiwanese employees, workload was positively related to WFC (r = .39), whereas family conflict was positively related to FWC (r = .24). Furthermore, independent self-construal exacerbated the positive relation between workload and WFC (the interaction effect accounted for an additional 1.7% of variance in WFC), but buffered the positive relation between family conflict and FWC (the interaction effect accounted for an additional 2.6% of variance in FWC). However, interdependent self-construal did not have a moderating effect on either the workload-WFC or family conflict-FWC relation. It is recommended that culture as construed at the individual level needs to be studied in order to understand its intricate effects on individuals' perceptions of work and family demands and conflict.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The global mental health (GMH) research agenda should include both culture-general and culture-specific perspectives to ensure ecological validity of findings. Despite its title, the current GMH research agenda appears to be using a monocultural model that is individualistic, illness-oriented, and focused on intrapsychic processes. Ironically, issues of culture are prominently absent in many discussions of global mental health. This paper highlights some issues and concerns considered key to conducting ecologically valid and socially responsible GMH research. The concerns are particularly directed at researchers from dominant cultures who are working in low-income countries. Central to these issues is the balance between etic and emic perspectives in assessment, diagnosis, and intervention, as well as language, engagement of stakeholders and their agendas, and evaluation of the benefit of interventions to the community. New terminology is proposed that identifies broad cultural groups, and recommendations provided for a research agenda to encourage both basic and applied research that mutually benefits all stakeholders in the GMH research endeavor.

In-depth interviews and focus groups reveal that participants identify biracially as ""Blaxican."" Participants reject monoraciality and the common sense way of defining Blackness as defined by the one-drop rule of hypodescent. Participants are either bicultural or monocultural dependent whether they were raised in single parent vis-a-vis co-parenting households. The authentic expression of Blaxicanness is to identify as biracial and have a bicultural identity, therefore those that are monocultural work to incorporate both cultures into their identities. Parental socialization, peer groups, school and neighborhood contexts are the main socializing agents that shape Blaxican identities. I find that Blaxicans live in a borderlands space in between the social constructions of Black and Chicana/o identities. Black and Chicana/o peers police the boundaries around ""authentic"" half-Black and half-Mexican identity forcing Blaxicans to the borderlands where ambiguity, and contradictions are embraced. Blaxicans experience monoracial microaggressions (Nadal et al. 2011) that signal their non-normative, marginal and second-class citizen status.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The article summarizes a research carried out about therapists having relational approaches and dealing with migrants in the clinical setting. The qualitative research has made use of Atlas-ti to understand the transformation of ""making therapy"" from a monocultural world to a multicultural world. The study has pointed out how therapists deeply need to update their own intervention and how this change occurs at different levels: epistemological, theorical, methodological. Within a multicultural environment the therapy looks to request a clinical practice that is able to vary its own means to more extensively interconnect with patients, clients, users having problems, expectations, perspectives different from those sharing the same cultural background. The reasearch eventually shows how the migrants bring in plenty of new therapy issues and urge into reckoning the therapy not anymore as a treatment but as a ""health project"".

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"With the goal to facilitate cultural competency development of students enrolled in graduate-level health professional education, this study examined the effectiveness of a curricular program guided by the Intercultural Developmental Continuum (IDC) as measured by the Intercultural Developmental Inventory (IDl). The IDl was administered to 17 occupational therapy (OT) students and a control group of 25 non-OT health professional students upon matriculation into their respective programs of graduate study and again upon completion of 3 years of study. OT students participated in a cultural curricular design guided by the IDC, while the control group participated in cultural study not guided by the IDC. Though OT students did not show a significant change in overall developmental orientation mean scores from pre-test to post-test (t = 0.847, p = 0.41), the results indicate that the designed intercultural curriculum increased intercultural competence among those OT students who began their program with the monocultural mindset of polarization (an ""us vs. them"" evaluative viewpoint) and moved to the interculturally transitional mindset of minimization (recognizing cultural commonalities and elimination of the ""us vs. them"" mindset). The control group showed a significant decrease in developmental orientation mean scores at post-test (t = 6.1, p < 0.001). No significant group or group by baseline interaction effects were found when comparing overall postdevelopmental scores adjusting for baseline (F = 2.4, rho = 0.131). The curriculum design as guided by the IDC, though it did not significantly increase overall cultural competency of OT students, appears to have mitigated a decrease in competence. Results suggest that the cultural challenges that students face appear to be considerable arid, without targeted, integrated intercultural preparation, can overwhelm new health professionals' intercultural capability.

The religiosity of 197 Turkish-Belgian adolescents was compared with that of 366 age-mates in Turkey (the heritage culture) and 203 in Belgium (the mainstream culture) and related to cultural values, acculturation orientations, and ethnic identification. Belgian adolescents showed lower and declining religiosity with age, whereas Turkish and Turkish-Belgian adolescents were more religious regardless of age. Acculturating adolescents reaffirmed religion as compared with monocultural adolescents in Turkey. Religious reaffirmation was related to cultural values of interdependence, heritage culture maintenance, and ethnic identification.

Recent data suggest the gap persists in spite of improved attention to the multicultural education of teachers, and in spite of recent, more culturally inclusive and responsive curricular materials and instructional recommendations. In this study, I examine the cases of two European American male novice science teachers in middle schools with highly diverse populations, exploring their perceptions of the necessity of adapting their instructional approaches and the science curricula in order to meet the needs of their predominantly Native American, Mexican American, and African American students. Two theoretical frameworks inform this study, Rodriguez's (2005) sociotransformative constructivism, and Freire's critical pedagogy. I apply a qualitative case study method, to better understand and analyze the classroom setting and power relations of the context. Data consist of semi-structured interviews with each teacher, classroom observation and other field notes, the science curricular and instructional materials, and teachers' lesson plans. Each teacher acknowledged the ethnicities of students positively and noticed distinctive ethnocultural features (e.g., quinceaneras, Mexican Americans). Yet, their teaching approaches were primarily teacher-centric and monocultural. Each followed the book, usually lecturing, and striving dutifully to ""cover"" the topics. They did not solicit students' knowledge or engage them in dialog to explore their thinking. Even when the curriculum guide detailed relevant science knowledge students of some cultural groups might have, both teachers declined to use it. These well-meaning teachers did not fully perceive that students whose culture was different from their own might have different and relevant knowledge, experiences, or histories which were resources for learning. As a result, even when the teachers tried more student- centered, inclusive strategies, such as implementing authentic science activities, they did not support students' construction of knowledge through responsive dialog. Teachers assigned to ethnically and culturally diverse students must be helped to fully understand that learners from other cultures have differing knowledge resources. Science teachers in particular must recognize the social and ideological landscape in which their teaching take place.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Seventeen years ago Gloria Ladson-Billings (1995) published the landmark article ""Toward a Theory of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy,"" giving a coherent theoretical statement for resource pedagogies that had been building throughout the 1970s and 1980s. I, like countless teachers and university-based researchers, have been inspired by what it means to make teaching and learning relevant and responsive to the languages, literacies, and cultural practices of students across categories of difference and (in)equality. Recently, however, I have begun to question if the terms ""relevant"" and ""responsive"" are really descriptive of much of the teaching and research founded upon them and, more importantly, if they go far enough in their orientation to the languages and literacies and other cultural practices of communities marginalized by systemic inequalities to ensure the valuing and maintenance of our multiethnic and multilingual society. In this essay, I offer the term and stance of culturally sustaining pedagogy as an alternative that, I believe, embodies some of the best research and practice in the resource pedagogy tradition and as a term that supports the value of our multiethnic and multilingual present and future. Culturally sustaining pedagogy seeks to perpetuate and foster-to sustain-linguistic, literate, and cultural pluralism as part of the democratic project of schooling. In the face of current policies and practices that have the explicit goal of creating a monocultural and monolingual society, research and practice need equally explicit resistances that embrace cultural pluralism and cultural equality.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In this article, drawing on qualitative interviews and documentary analysis, we argue that the Jewish community in Britain has undergone a fundamental shift since 1990 from a 'strategy of security', a strategy of communal leadership based on emphasizing the secure British citizenship and belonging of the UK's Jews, to a 'strategy of insecurity', where the communal leadership instead stresses an excess of security among Anglo-Jewry. We demonstrate this based on two case studies: of the Jewish renewal movement in the 1990s and the 'new antisemitism' phenomenon of the 2000s. We conclude that this shift is tied to the shift from a monocultural Britain to an officially multicultural one, and that therefore there are lessons that can be taken from it for the study of British and other multiculturalisms.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Migrations have intensified with the advent of globalisation. Societies once solidly monocultural are becoming increasingly multicultural. It is, however, not clear how social capital would travel across cultural boundaries. A multicultural environment might result on agents preferring to interact with those of their own culture, discriminating against others. We study trust, an aspect of social capital, between domestic Australian students of non-Asian origin and international students of Asian origin. To measure the degree of trust and patterns of discrimination between these groups, the Berg et al. (1995) trust game and a series of control games were used in framework where each participant played each game against several partners knowing their domestic or international status. Controlling for individual heterogeneity, domestic students significantly discriminated against international students in the trust game, and individual discrimination was taste-based rather than based on beliefs towards international students' trustworthiness. Moreover, the average amount that international students sent in the trust game was negatively related with the number of semesters studied at university in Australia, which may partly reflect cultural adjustment but also institutional disadvantages faced specifically by international students. The study furthers understanding of the patterns of discrimination between domestic and international university students and the nature of this discrimination.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This research examines the mediating role of emotions implicated in the multicultural experience-creativity link. We propose that when individuals are dealing with apparent cultural contradictions upon encountering two cultures simultaneously, mentally juxtaposing dissonant cultural stimuli could lower positive affect or increase negative affect, which could in turn induce a deeper level of cognitive processing of cultural discrepancies and inspire creativity. Two studies compared dual cultural exposure versus single cultural exposure among bicultural Singaporeans (Study 1) and compared self-relevant (jointly presenting local and foreign cultures) versus self-irrelevant (jointly presenting foreign cultures only) dual cultural exposure among monocultural Taiwanese (Study 2). As in past research, dual cultural exposure promotes creativity, particularly if one presented culture is self-relevant. Further, this effect was mediated by a less positive or a more negative emotional state. These findings illuminate the underlying influence of emotions activated by simultaneous exposure to diverse cultures.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study investigates the link between motivational and affective experiences in the daily life of bicultural individuals. Employing a diary design, the authors examined the role of cultural identification in the dynamic goal-affect association in East-Asian Canadian biculturals. Using multilevel modeling procedures, the authors found that momentary cultural identification systematically moderated the association between extrinsic motivation and Negative Affect (NA) over time. Similar to previous findings observed from monocultural Westerners, biculturals in this study showed a positive association between extrinsic motivation and NA when they identified with Western culture. When they identified with Asian culture, however, biculturals' extrinsic motivation was not linked to NA, suggesting that when their Asian identity is salient, they are less negatively influenced by extrinsic goal pursuit than when they identified with Western culture. Findings indicate the importance of within-individual short-term variations in cultural identification for understanding the affective implications of extrinsic motivation in the lives of bicultural individuals.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Substantial variations have been found in the ways in which individuals within different cultural groups identify themselves. Typically, members of individualistic national cultures perceive themselves as more independent of others, while members of collectivistic national cultures perceive themselves as more interdependent with others. In early studies, self-construal was most frequently conceptualised as a relatively trait-like quality that could be measured by open-ended self-description or by self-report scales. To be validly employed, data from such measures need to be analysed in ways that take account of cultural differences in the tendency to acquiescent responding. Independent and interdependent self-construals have been found to correlate with cross-national differences in a wide variety of social behaviours. More recently, greater account has been taken of individuals' capacity to choose between a range of personal and social identities, dependent upon the salience of alternative social contexts. The effect of context is much greater among respondents from collectivistic cultures. The contrast between independent and interdependent self-construal has proved oversimple, and a range of alternatives has been proposed. A distinction between individual, relational and collective identities may more validly capture the range of cross-cultural variation. Given that self-construals are mutable, experimental priming techniques can be used to determine the extent to which variations in self-construal are able to cause effects that are equivalent to cultural differences in social cognition. Recent studies have focused primarily on bicultural respondents, and the utility of priming studies to explain differences between monocultural populations remains to be determined.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The study explored the content and hierarchical structure of representations of New Zealand national character and identity. We argue that at the most abstract level perceived elements of New Zealand national character reflect a tension between two different domains. The first reflects an Anglicized monocultural representation of what it means to be a ""true New Zealander"" derived primarily from dominant majority (NZ European or Pakeha) groups' symbols and values. The second reflects an inclusive recognition, albeit tokenized, of symbolic aspects of Maori culture and pluralistic intergroup relations. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified five distinct sub-factors of national character nested within these two broader exclusive (Anglicized monocultural) and inclusive (pluralist) factors (or overall representations). Monocultural aspects of national character included representations of rugby/sporting culture, citizenship and ancestry, and to a lesser extent patriotic values. Pluralistic aspects of national character, in contrast, included representations of cultural/bicultural awareness and liberal democratic values, but also patriotism. The socio-cultural geneses of this hierarchically-organized representational structure are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Editorial,"This issue of International Journal of Social Research Methodology: Theory & Practice focuses on the management of the decline of globalized methodology. The limits of globalization are evident in many fields, from economy to politics, from marketing to culture. Methodology is not free from these limits. However while European or US societies are becoming more and more multicultural, many methodologists and researchers still use monocultural methods. Moreover these colonial methods are still applied in non-Western countries with little reflexivity. Consequently these traditional methods do not capture the richness of meanings embedded in opinions, attitudes, and actions of participants under study. There is an emerging need to find postcolonial methodologies when working with multicultural populations, in order to make culturally flexible contemporary research methods. The attempt to decolonize contemporary methodology requires a reflexive investigation of what are the common-sense assumptions, conceptions or ideologies behind research methods, both quantitative and qualitative. Starting from this reflection methodology and research methods need to be recreated in order to suit the local cultures. Irrelevance is associated with methodology presented as universal and context-free as seen in textbooks uncritically exported around the globe.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the value of teaching about mental illness through the use of literature. Design/methodology/approach: Using the examples of two colleges in eastern USA that focus on educating students for healthcare careers, the paper examines two different course formats for using literature to teach about mental illness: a course that places the topic within the larger context of medicine and literature; and a freestanding madness and literature course. Findings: While professional education tends towards specialization, it can lead to a monocultural vision that limits approaches to patients and problems alike. Courses integrating mental illness and literature were found to be effective means of counteracting this trend. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited to two healthcare-centred colleges in eastern USA. Practical implications: For mental health clinicians and healthcare professionals in general, literature broadens the scope of both perspectives and analytical tools for understanding mental disorders and responses to them. Originality/value: While literature courses often contain such themes as mental illness, courses that truly integrate literature with mental illness meet a growing need for interdisciplinary education as a means of preparing more flexibly thinking healthcare professionals.

Due to the unique cognitive systems, people from different cultures may process media messages differently. The first goal is to explore the role of availability of a value schema in the media framing process and to discover how the media framing effect may vary across cultural groups in which the value schema is more or less available in their memories. Using the values of filial piety and press freedom as case studies, I conducted a 2 (media frames: value frame vs. value-neutral frame) x 2 (monocultural individuals: Beijing Chinese vs. Anglo-Americans) experiment. The monocultural cognitive system is unique, because monocultures internalize one cultural meaning system and primarily rely on one interpretative framework for processing. Some cultural value schemas may be widely distributed in one monocultural group, but may be less available in another. The results in the case study of filial piety value show that, after reading the filial piety framed article, the framing effect on issue attitude, interpretation, and judgment is likely to vary across Beijing Chinese and Anglo-Americans. The second goal is to explore the role of the applicability of a value schema in the media framing process and to learn how the effect of media framing varies within an individual, depending on which cultural interpretative framework was being applied for processing. Using the bicultural Chinese as the sample, I conducted a 3 (Cultural primes: Chinese primes vs. American primes vs. Control primes) x 2 (media frames; value frame vs. value-neutral frame) experiment. The bicultural cognitive system is unique, because biculturals internalize two or more cultural meaning systems, and they are likely to apply either system in guiding their processing, depending on the cues in the social environment. The results in the case study of the filial piety value show that, after reading the filial piety framed article, the media framing effect on responsibility attribution is likely to vary across whichever cultural meaning system is being applied for processing. The implications of these two experiments are discussed.

I use Lawrence-Lightfoot's (1997; 2005) qualitative research methodology ""portraiture"" in order to illuminate the contextual factors influencing teachers' working worlds as they attempt to engage multiculturalism in their classrooms. Specifically, this research analyzes White social studies teachers' conceptualizations, practice, and engagement of American Indian Studies in accordance with Montana's state-wide mandate, ""Indian Education for All"" (IEFA) and finds that larger school functions, procedures, and policies actively squelch teachers' ability to meaningfully engage IEFA. The research here demonstrates that the ways teachers position themselves against larger school structures disallow deep engagement with Indigenous perspectives and in fact, encourage a monocultural teaching approach. Through the lenses of Whiteness Theory and Tribal Critical Race Theory, this study finds that despite the efforts of IEFA advocates and staff, school and classroom functions protect White space and privilege while colonizing Indian space.

With respect to social work, as well as to nursing, psychology, and allied health, this commitment is often translated into a single goal: that graduates should be ""culturally competent"". While acknowledging that there can be tactical advantages in pursuing this goal the current paper develops a practical critique of the expectation that cultural competence is an unproblematic ""add on"" to professional education. Using a single case study as an example-how the subject ""individual development"" is transmitted as a monocultural and unproblematic formation-we argue that it is impossible to learn to work cross-culturally without developing a capacity for reflective self-scrutiny. Less likely to be a flag of convenience than ""cultural competence"", an allegiance to ""critical awareness"" prompts the interrogation of received knowledge, for example how human development and personhood is understood, as well stimulating an engagement in the lifelong process of reflecting on one's own ideological and cultural location.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Intercultural competence/sensitivity is increasingly recognized across the global spectrum of educational institutions, corporations, government agencies and non-government organizations as a central capability for the 21st century. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) is an assessment tool that measures the level of intercultural competence/sensitivity across a developmental continuum for individuals, groups, and organizations and represents a theoretically grounded measure of this capability for perceiving cultural differences and commonalities and modifying behavior to cultural context. This study represents additional cross-cultural validity testing of the IDI, building on the previous work of Paige, Jacobs-Cassuto, Yershova, and DeJaeghere (2003) and Hammer, Bennett, and Wiseman (2003). The 50 items from IDI v2 were administered to 4763 individuals from 11 distinct, cross-cultural samples. Confirmatory factor analysis confirms the following basic orientations toward cultural difference originally explicated by Bennett (1986, 1993) in the Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS): Denial, Defense, Reversal, Minimization, Acceptance, and Adaptation. In addition, it also identifies Cultural Disengagement as an additional scale within the IDI; but one that is not located along the developmental continuum. Second, the inter-scale correlations support the theoretically proposed, developmental formulation from Denial through Adaptation. Third, the current analysis offers strong support for an overall Developmental Orientation (DO) scale and an overall Perceived Orientation (PO) scale. Fourth, Minimization is found to be a transitional orientation toward cultural differences and commonalities, between the more monocultural (ethnocentric) orientations of Denial and Polarization (Defense, Reversal) and the more intercultural mindsets of Acceptance and Adaptation. Fifth, readability analysis indicates the IDI is appropriate for high (secondary) school students (age 15 or above) or individuals with a 10th grade reading level. Finally, criterion validity of the IDI was assessed. The results indicate that the IDI has strong predictive validity toward bottom-line goals within organizations; namely, the achievement of diversity and inclusion goals in the recruitment and staffing function. These findings complement previous results that demonstrated that the IDI also possesses strong content and construct validity across culture groups.

This phenomenon prompted this research, which is structured around the primary research question: In what ways and under what conditions do multicultural ministries in South Korea contribute to effective ministry for North Korean refugees and South Koreans? The researcher attempts to help Christians understand the diverse needs of North Korean refugees in South Korea, the effectiveness of multicultural ministries in helping to meet the needs, and the dynamics of transforming the refugees' worldview through multicultural ministries. The research findings of this study appear to support the conclusion that multicultural ministry is more effective than monocultural churches in helping North Korean refugees adjust to South Korean society. Multicultural ministry also is more effective in transforming the worldview of North Korean refugees into a Christian worldview. Comprehensive mission strategies are also revealed in the findings. Multicultural ministry is an effective mission strategy for reaching North Korean refugees with the gospel. Church revitalization, cultural sensitivity and nonformal education are important mission strategies for effective multicultural ministry in South Korea. Using qualitative and quantitative research methods, this research includes interviews with North Korean refugees, South Korean volunteers in North Korean refugee ministries, South Korean ministers, North Korean refugees who have become ministers, and mission experts in relevant fields. To triangulate with qualitative research data, the research includes a quantitative survey with North Korean refugees and South Korean Christians in multicultural and monocultural ministries.

Unfortunately, international assignments are failing, with expatriates returning home prematurely. Multicultural individuals may be ideal candidates for these cross-cultural assignments; however, there is a dearth of research on both multicultural students and employees abroad, and no research testing the propositions that these multicultural individuals would be culturally intelligent and high-functioning expatriates. In this dissertation, I investigated the expatriate effectiveness and cultural intelligence of multicultural and monocultural individuals using on-line longitudinal data from 57 study-abroad students (possible future expatriates). I found that cultural intelligence predicted greater expatriate adjustment and that it increases after the study-abroad experience. Furthermore, multicultural individuals were better psychologically adjusted than monocultural individuals while abroad. I also examined differences in expatriate effectiveness and cultural intelligence based on bicultural individuals' cultural integration (acculturation) and bicultural identity integration (BII), with the finding that cultural integration predicted better academic performance abroad. Exploratory analyses with transnational individuals revealed that they had poorer psychological adjustment and lower academic performance while abroad, and lower cultural intelligence after studying abroad (despite similar levels of cultural intelligence before studying abroad) compared to other multicultural individuals. This dissertation was able to replicate previous findings on cultural intelligence and expatriate effectiveness and to extend those findings to study-abroad students and multicultural individuals. More research is needed to further understand the cultural intelligence of multicultural individuals, and the ways in which cultural intelligence might relate to BII. The findings regarding transnationalism suggest that the process of adapting to living and working in another country may be different when that country is the country of one's heritage. This dissertation contributes to the understanding of multicultural individuals' global mobility and provides a foundation on which to conduct further research on expatriate effectiveness, cultural intelligence, multiculturalism, and transnationalism. Finally, based on these findings, multinational corporations may want to select multicultural individuals for expatriation, and provide training to maximize the benefits of having multicultural expatriates by helping them to integrate their cultures and to minimize potential drawbacks by helping transnational multicultural expatriates develop realistic expectations of their heritage country.

Vol.71(9-A),2011, pp. 3336.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"Biculturalism, defined as the internalization of two cultural meaning systems and the associated ability to use two cultural repertoires, is critical for managers in cross-cultural settings in multinational corporations (MNCs). Building on research on biculturalism in psychology and cultural-cognitive embeddedness in sociology, I provide a conceptualization of biculturalism in the context of MNC cross-cultural managers. Biculturalism involves culture-cognitive structures that pertain to two cultures and that affect individuals' perceptions and actions, operating in interaction with cultural cues in the environment. Biculturalism allows cross-cultural managers to function within different cultural contexts by applying the appropriate culture. However, many cross-cultural tasks require the consideration of both cultural perspectives in an integrated fashion. To address this, I introduce the concept of bicultural integration. It captures the degree to which cross-cultural managers simultaneously access and use the two cultures based on the integration of culture-cognitive structures-ranging from low bicultural integration which involves switching between the two cultures to high bicultural integration. Two theoretical models explaining the development of biculturalism and the determinants of bicultural integration are presented. The central tenet is that people engage in and learn culture within processes of cultural participation and that the development of biculturalism is marked by recognizable social relationship patterns. Based on this, I propose that biculturalism and bicultural integration are shaped by the configuration of an individual's social networks with members of two cultures and that these states occur via cultural participation mechanisms. The theoretical development of the cultural participation approach is based on the sociological conception of culture as enacted, experienced, and used within social interactions and on situated learning conceptions that focus on understanding through participation in social processes. The models will be assessed using qualitative methodology for cultural analysis and social network analysis on a sample of U.S. managers in German MNCs in Germany. In a pre-study, I will identify monocultural schemata and determine cultural coding schemes in the U.S. and Germany as well as develop an interview protocol for the main study. In the main study, data collection of cultural and social network data involves interviews and a questionnaire. Biculturalism and bicultural integration will be assessed using the developed coding schemes. The models are tested using multiple regression analysis. This dissertation contributes to the IM literature, more specifically, the understudied area of cultural embeddedness of people and processes in MNCs. The main theoretical and methodological contributions include: (1) using a sociological perspective of culture that extends our knowledge of culture in the context of MNCs beyond value dimensions and shifts from a view of cross-cultural differences to one of culture-cognitive mediation; (2) addressing the social embeddedness of cross-cultural managers in MNCs, specifically, their culture-cognitive and structural embeddedness; (3) providing an explanation of biculturalism in cross-cultural managers ; (4) conceptualizing the concept of biculturalism based on a theory of culture; (3) introducing the concept of bicultural integration to address different ways in which two internalized cultures can be organized and accessed; (4) identifying the mechanism of cultural participation through which biculturalism and bicultural integration are formed; (5) developing a novel measurement technique and instruments for biculturalism and bicultural integration based on the qualitative analysis of texts.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In Quebec, the link between national identity and literature has been a central question for a long time. This was particularly the case between the emergence of the idea of a national text in French at the beginning of the nineteenth century and the nationalist project of the so called Quiet Revolution at the beginning of the 1960s. It was not until the 1980s, after the ""no"" to Quebec sovereignty in the referendum of 1980, that Quebec literature entered a new era in terms of the relationship between literature and national identity. From the 1980s onwards, feminist writing, so called intimate writing and migrant literature would play central parts. Migrant literature is particularly interesting here, since it can be looked upon as a decisive change of focus in Quebec literature. So far, the literary canon had been determined by a monocultural French-speaking we. With the arrival of migrant literature new perspectives came in which were not always so easily integrated in what had previously been looked upon as Quebec national literature. Among the best known authors in Quebec migrant literature are Marco Micone, Ying Chen, Regine Robin, Dany Laferriere, Emile Ollivier, Wajdi Mouawad, and Marie-Celie Agnant.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Making a world of difference. Personal leadership: A methodology of two principles and six practices by B. F. Schaetti et al. (2008). This book is a long-awaited articulation of the work of three prominent interculturalists: Sheila Ramsey, Barbara Schaetti, and Gordon Watanabe. Although Personal Leadership was originally developed in the mid-1990s in the context of intercultural education and training to promote multicultural teamwork in the intern program of the Summer Institute for Intercultural Communication in Portland, Oregon, it has evolved into an approach that can be applied by people who want to inspire themselves to live and work more mindfully and creatively in any context. The reference section shows that in addition to intercultural communication, the sources that have informed the development of Personal Leadership also include education, leadership development, positive psychology, the biological and the quantum sciences, whole person self-development, and the wisdom traditions. By practicing Personal Leadership of our own cultural experience, we can disentangle from our default cultural programming, whether it is monocultural or complex and multilayered.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"It is currently estimated that up to 40% of Aboriginal youth (aged 13-17) will experience some form of mental health problem within their lifetime. Of greater concern is the evidence that indicates that Aboriginal youth fail to access mental health services commensurate with this need. This is due, in part, to the characteristically monocultural nature of service delivery of existing services. This paper overviews a model that has been developed specifically for the engagement of Aboriginal youth (aged 13-17 years) in mental health settings. Importantly, a mix of urban (N=43) and rural (N=68) Aboriginal youth were represented within the sample to determine its efficacy across different language and tribal groups. The model proved to be effective in engaging 97% of Aboriginal youth (n=108), with only a small number not effectively engaged (n=3). The model provides a foundation for the further development of evidence-based models of best practice that have so far provided to be elusive within this complex field.

Vol.71(6-A),2010, pp. 2180.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"This dissertation examines the movements of Koreans living abroad in diaspora and explores ways in which overseas Koreans use artistic activities to express self and configure identity. Whereas Part I treats the historiography, history and policy of Korean migration, Part II focuses on artists who participated in controversial exhibitions including the 2002 Kwangju Biennial's There Project and the 2004 Korean Diaspora and Art Symposium held in Tokyo. The There exhibition brought together twenty-four artists from Brazil, China, Japan, Kazahkstan, and the U.S. while the exhibition in Tokyo presented artwork, performance, and multi-media installations by thirteen artists, in part organized as a response to the dissatisfaction with There. The two sites showcase a scale of identities and tensions produced in the attempt to understand Korean diaspora, especially in relation to the archive that posits Korean migrants and migration history as one that is hierarchical in nature based upon ethnic oneness and pure-blood relations. I propose diasporic art is produced by artists residing outside a homeland. Key to Korean diasporic art is that artists explore a shared history of displacement and present historical memories of events reconstructed affectively and re-imagined nostalgically, a reason why I use ethnographic methods. The visual arts, artists, and cultural production, thus, provide the material means to cast diaspora in order to communicate the complex subject-position and history of Koreans in diaspora in a way that can engage with the local communities of those residing abroad and a Korean audience that is still insistent upon connections to homeland, as the Kwangju and Tokyo exhibitions reveal. Through the study of these diasporic artists, the dissertation brings light to multiple identity formations that resist dominant narratives of the nation and reflect differing experiences of class, gender, global and national politics, and particular local situations. However, one also sees a paradox of diasporic art as it pertains to Korean artists in that some artists still reinforce monocultural or singular conceptions of national culture and belonging bound by homogeneity and blood ties. In other words, the paradox of diasporic art reveals that artwork critical of essentialist understandings of self, community, or nation both undermine master narratives of the nation-state at the same time as they reinforce them.

However, the composition of the nation's teaching force has not kept pace with these changes. Additionally, there is concern that many Pre-service teachers are ill prepared to work with culturally diverse students, partly because teacher education programs (TEPs) often adopt a monocultural, one-size-fits-all approach to preparation, ignoring race, class, and gender considerations (King & Castnell, 2001). African American women who seek preparation are greatly impacted by this singular approach to teacher education, which influences the way in which they experience their training. Consequently, they are often underserved in TEPs (Cozart & Price, 2005). It has been argued that TEPs will have to broaden their approaches to preparation by using a culturally relevant approach to teaching (Gay & Kirkland, 2003). Given the necessity for teachers to be equipped to meet the needs of culturally diverse learners in the classroom, it is imperative that TEPs are designed to cultivate culturally appropriate practices within Pre-service teachers. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the nature of the diversity preparation of five African American women and their teaching experiences following the completion of their teacher education training. The critical ethnographic case studies that developed were theoretically framed in Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (Ladson-Billings, 1995), Black Feminist Thought (Collins, 1990), and Womanism (Phillips, 2006). Data were collected from classroom observations, individual, and group interviews. Using a system of open coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1998), data analysis resulted in the emergence of three overarching themes: (a) the formal diversity preparation offered by the university, (b) the women's individual perspectives of cultural relevance, and (c) the ways in which the women incorporated their perspectives into their classroom practices. The experiences the young women encountered significantly influenced their understandings of culture and its impact on learning for diverse student populations. The results of this study suggest the need for teacher educators to reconsider how TEPs are structured to better prepare minority Pre-service teachers in the future to teach culturally diverse students.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Media provides a material site for girls' identity formation and presents conflicting images of femininity, which challenge young women's self-expression and physicality development. The 'problem' with girls' physicality has not been resolved, but rather complicated by discourses of new femininities in sport, fitness and health promoted by the new economies. Girls' conscious and unconscious consumption of messages of new powerful femininities might be troubling for some girls, especially 'Other' girls and/or girls 'at risk,' whose physicality collides with the emerging image of the new girls. Therefore, in this paper, I contend that an investment in the third-wave feminist agenda is still necessary to engage scholars, educators and girls in critical conversations about media, genders, the body and identity. To this end, first I discuss the feminist reappraisal of Foucault's analysis of the body as an emancipatory socio-educational and political project for (en)gendering research on the feminine 'docile body' in society. Second, I highlight emerging contemporary monocultural discourses of the 'Alpha Girl' and the 'Future Girl,' powerful sporty, fit and healthy femininities that contradict discourses of the traditional feminine docile body, and I analyze the ways these new images subsume race, class, religion and disability. Finally, I conclude this article by advocating the adoption of critical media pedagogies as a potential strategy for schooling girls' hybrid bodies.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: This paper seeks to report on the evaluation of Zippy's Friends, an international emotional wellbeing programme, for primary school children in disadvantaged schools in Ireland. The paper aims to present case studies of the profile and ethos of two specific schools participating in the programme, their links with the local community, the degree of parental involvement and the factors that influence programme implementation in the local context. Design/methodology/approach: Within the framework of the overall evaluation study, which employs a randomised controlled design, two schools self-selected to participate in case studies. Employing interviews and group discussions, the case study method was used to explore the views of teachers, pupils, parents and key informants from the wider community on the delivery of the programme within the context of a whole school approach. Findings: The findings from two contrasting schools are presented, a large urban school with a multi-cultural profile in an area of multiple disadvantage, and a smaller, almost monocultural, rural school on the border region with Northern Ireland. The findings reveal largely positive attitudes on the benefits of the programme and support for a whole school approach. The data indicate contrasting levels of parental involvement in the two schools and highlight the importance of socio- economic and cultural influences in the local communities and the challenges these present for effective implementation. Research limitations/implications: The paper explores the specific contextual factors in two schools and may, therefore, lack generalisability. However, this effort to focus on the specific local context is useful within the framework of the overall randomised control trial evaluation study. Practical implications: The reality of implementing an emotional wellbeing programme in disadvantaged school settings and effectively engaging teachers, parents and the wider community, is explored through the use of case study methods. Originality/value: The paper explores the real-life context of two schools participating in the Zippy's Friends programme and provides an insight into the contextual factors impacting on programme implementation in disadvantaged school settings.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: The paper's aim is to explore how bicultural consumers differ from monocultural consumers, and among themselves, in terms of country-of-origin effect and ethnocentrism. Design/methodology/approach: A multidisciplinary literature review pointed to a set of hypotheses regarding the differences between biculturals (Mexican Americans) and monoculturals (Mexicans and Americans), and between bicultural groups (integrating biculturals versus alternating biculturals). Two pilot tests and two experiments were conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings: Bicultural Mexican Americans are less ethnocentric than either American or Mexican monoculturals; exhibit more favorable quality evaluation and purchase intention toward American brands than Mexican monoculturals; and exhibit more favorable quality evaluation and purchase intention toward Mexican brands than American monoculturals. Although ethnocentrism does not significantly demarcate alternating biculturals from their integrating counterparts, alternators are more likely than integrators to provide a favorable evaluation of foreign brands and entertain the intention to purchase them. Research limitations/implications: As a starting-point for understanding the bicultural consumer, this study is subject to exploratory research limitations. Originality/value: The country-of-origin literature implicitly assumes that consumers identify with either the country where the product is originated or the country where it is sold. This assumption, however, might not hold for ethnic groups who identify with both countries. Such bicultural consumers might identify with the product's origin country as well as target country and, therefore, be less amenable to the country-of-origin hypothesis. We address this important research gap.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article explores gendered observations and experiences of executive women on the basis of common world views or lenses through which gender differences are interpreted and understood. Three types of lenses are identified from both the literature and the data: monocultural, statistical and structural. The discussion explores the relationships and ties between each lens noting the overlapping characteristics. A qualitative study is used to index the various themes and the coping strategies employed by executive women in Australia based on specific work experiences in leadership and gender relations. The study adds to existing gender theory by highlighting how gendered lenses can be used to explore gender hierarchies and inequality regimes which lie at the centre of executive women's work.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book Translating lives: Living with two languages and cultures edited by M. Besemeres, and A. Wierzbicka (2007). This book is edited by a team of mother and daughter, each contributing a chapter as well as coauthoring the introduction. In the introductory pages they allude to the gap that still exists between the reality of Australia as a multilingual, multicultural country and the ongoing dominance of a monolingual, Anglo-centric perspective both at societal and individual levels. This book is a timely addition to the literature on issues relating to cultures, languages, and identities. It consists of 12 chapters-each one devoted to an experiential account of a life in which more than one language plays a part. These succeed in covering a range of linguistic heritages including Noongar, Indo-Fijian, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, and three European languages: German, Russian, and Polish. The book can be read on a number of levels. It can sensitize the monolingual, possibly monocultural, layperson to issues that may not have occurred to him/her previously. It can reassure the bilingual or multilingual man/woman in the street, who may feel alienated living in a monolingual society, that he/she is not alone. Many critical questions are raised about the interplay of languages, world views, and a sense of self.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how bicultural consumers differ from monocultural consumers in terms of personality traits and identity negotiation. Design/methodology/approach - Through a multidisciplinary literature review, some anecdotally and qualitatively supported differences between biculturals and monoculturals are reviewed and formulated as hypotheses, and a survey is used to collect quantitative data from a mixed random-purposeful sample. Findings - Relative to monoculturals, biculturals exhibit greater concern about their acceptability within pertinent reference groups and society at large; have comparable levels of need for uniqueness and art enthusiasm; and consume more artwork as a means and in the process of their routine negotiation of (ethnic) identity. Ethnicity, need for social acceptability, need for group identification, and art enthusiasm are predictors of artwork consumption. Ethnicity, in particular, is a key precursor of artwork consumption. Research limitations/implications - As a starting-point for understanding the bicultural consumer, the study is subject to exploratory research limitations. Originality/value - As partial manifestations of globalization, businesses are challenged today in several ways by the rise and proliferation of the bicultural neotribe. Businesses do not have to fall victim to these challenges; they can turn them around and strategically leverage them as marketplace opportunities. The study provides some early insights that can help businesses to leverage such opportunities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Since an amendment to the Immigration Control Act in 1990, which granted 2nd and 3rd generation Japanese unlimited visa status to work in Japan, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of Brazilians of Japanese descent coming to Japan. As a result, there is a large number of couples comprising Japanese and Japanese-Brazilian in Japan. In this paper, I investigated the conditions involving Cross-Culture Kids (CCK) born of these marriages. The children's first language is Japanese, and an overwhelming number of parents want their children to learn English as a second language rather than Portuguese. Regarding the children's name, there were few cases in which the child used a Brazilian name. In Japanese society, which emphases uniformity and homogeneity, using a Japanese name is one method of resolving the issue of being different from others. Parents with children who are not immediately recognizable as CCKs based on characteristics of outward appearance have developed strategies for avoiding discrimination and prejudice through passing. However, passing offers little possibility of enjoying the advantages of multicultural society. CCKs with two nationalities and cultural backgrounds should be guaranteed the right to enjoy the benefit of maintaining and developing an identity as a Japanese, in addition to one more identity. W e need to encourage a new awareness of CCKs as agents for a transition from a monocultural system to a multicultural system, not only in Japanese schools, but in Japanese society as a whole.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The authors review the call for cultural competence in psychiatric diagnosis and highlight the barrier of 'monocultural ethnocentrism'-the tendency to presume that European-American standards fit all cultural, racial and ethnic groups. They suggest that clinicians should: familiarise themselves with the history of racism in psychiatry; avoid stereotyping; appreciate the diversity within cultural, racial and ethnic groups; understand that individuals from various cultural, racial and ethnic groups may have had more traumatic experiences; and understand that individuals from the US and UK may have experiences with racism, some of which may cause mental illness. Finally the authors suggest strategies to increase cultural competence.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article reports findings from a mixed-method investigation of a cohort of teacher candidates who were placed in an urban and culturally diverse practicum site at an elementary school. Fifteen preservice teachers completed pre- and posttest measures related to hope, motivation for teaching, and efficacy for teaching. Throughout the semester, they were required to investigate personal beliefs and past experiences with cultural diversity in the form of writing reflective response letters and cultural autobiographies. Providing the students with these opportunities was beneficial; however, findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest that (a) multiple opportunities across time are needed to uncover and dialogue about beliefs to present significant change rather than single, isolated opportunities and (b) teacher candidates with multicultural schooling and life experiences are more likely to have favorable beliefs and attitudes regarding cultural diversity than are candidates with monocultural schooling and life experiences.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"We examined the extent to which Hispanic orientation and American orientation are associated with substance use (cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana) both directly and indirectly through acculturative stress and self-esteem. Participants were 347 Hispanic early adolescents (50.7% male; mean age = 12.57, SD = 0.92, range 11-15) from two middle schools in western Michigan. Findings showed that self-esteem emerged as the most consistent predictor of likelihood and extent of substance use. Ethnic identity was positively related to risk for substance use, and acculturative stress and self-esteem mediated the relationships of Hispanic cultural orientation to alcohol use. Self-esteem was the most important protective factor against substance use, and as such, we conclude that prevention programs designed to address precocious substance use that incorporate a self-esteem building component could prove useful among Hispanic early adolescents residing in monocultural contexts within the United States.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book, Translating lives: living with two languages and cultures edited by M. Besemeres and A. Wierzbicka (2007). This is a highly enjoyable collection of personal narratives by 12 Australians who share glimpses of their journeys in being and becoming linguistic and cultural boundary crossers. It is the first book of its kind to deal with the Australian context, and it is meant to provide monocultural and monolingual Australians with a sense of living with and between two or more languages. This book is meant to expand the worldview of such Australians who operate exclusively in English through learning about the experiences of bilinguals living in Australia. There are two strong threads that tie the narratives together which make this collection an important contribution for the interrelated fields of bilingualism, biculturalism, identity studies, and global migration. The first thread is the development of intercultural awareness as a result of living with two languages and two or more cultural scripts. The second, perhaps less prominent, thread is some authors' recognition of cultural changes in the linguistic and cultural scripts of their first languages in their countries of origin or in heritage-language speaking communities in Australia.

Employing ethnographically-sensitive critical discourse analysis, this study contributes to the fields of English Language Teaching (ELT), Border Studies, and Nationalism Studies by introducing three analytical terms that provide a means to document the social construction of nation-states (termed herein as imagined national communities of practice). The three terms are (1) nationalist practices, which refers to social practice that presupposes nationalist principles, (2) nationalist border practices, which refers to discerning self/other along nationalist lines, and (3) nationalist standard practices, which refers to the articulation of nationalist standards of language and subjectivity. The students attending the class under analysis comprise a unique population in that they are adults who occupy positions of economic and social privilege in the Nogales Sonora community because of their management-level employment at maquila factories. Reflecting their status, the students are invested in nationalist practices of border and standard in order to align themselves with nation-state institutions and to distance themselves from cultural and linguistic liminality (e.g., Mexican-American, paisano, code-switching, and Spanglish) characteristic of border regions. The classroom under observation upheld nationalist borders and standards, with important consequences. First, nationalist notions of border led classroom participants to disavow the bilingual language use that was clearly necessary for successful classroom operations, despite an English immersion classroom policy. Second, nationalist practices established the local classroom space as indexically linked to an imagined American community of practice, understood by students to be authentically monolingual, monocultural, and distinct from Mexico. Association with-but not full incorporation into-this particular understanding of the American nation-state is advantageous to students for maintaining their elevated social and economic positioning in the local Nogales Sonora community. Thus, this classroom serves as a site of nationalist border reproduction and the reinforcement of hierarchies of privilege. The study encourages teacher reflection on what nationalism can mean to formal language learning contexts and suggests directions for re-aligning classroom practice to approaches that embrace multilingual realities of language learning contexts.

Vol.70(6-A),2009, pp. 1889.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"This study is a situated qualitative investigation of the multiple languages and identities of three Japanese international school students in Japan. These students had no foreign heritage or experience living outside Japan, but had been educated completely in English-medium international schools since kindergarten. In effect, they had been socialized into another culture and language without leaving Japan-a relatively monolingual and monocultural country. The participants' complex linguistic situations and identities were investigated using narrative inquiry over a period of 19 months. Their narratives, gathered primarily by interviews, were supplemented by observations, interviews of those close to them, and other data sources. Using postmodernist-influenced concepts as analytical lenses, I was able to bring to light the students' complex views on language and identity emerging from their unique linguistic and cultural experiences. The students in this study revealed that one does not necessarily belong to a single dominant culture or have a single ""first language."" These students felt most comfortable with their multiple cultures and languages in a third space (Bhabha, 1994), and they actively took part in creating their own hybrid cultures, languages, and identities. The students' hybrid languages and identities were nurtured and secure within the international school community. However, once outside this community, the students realized the complexities within themselves, requiring that they learn to negotiate their identities, as identity crucially involves location and relationships with others. When they were able to visualize their futures as bilingual/bicultural individuals, their identities became somewhat clearer and less contested. At that point, they felt that their linguistic and cultural hybridity was not entirely an obstacle, but something that they could also use to their advantage. It was when they had to make either-or choices between cultures, languages, and identities that they felt troubled or deficient. Through their narratives, the participants revealed the extent to which static categories and monolithic notions of language and culture were imposed upon them, and how these affected their understanding and perceptions of themselves. In conclusion, I interrogate such static views and urge researchers, educators, and bilingual/bicultural individuals to view languages and identities in more complex ways.

Further, there is a brief overview of the following: the history of penology; criminalization and deinstitutionalization; attachment theory; Adler's social interest; Piaget's sensorimotor stages and cognitive theories (including language and thought) as it relates to current correctional systems; and therapeutic treatment effectiveness. In addition, the study explores various models that are commonly used in therapeutic communities (TC's), such as behaviorism. Moreover, additional approaches, including CBT's (cognitive based therapy) and the diathesis-stress model that support Kegan's qualitative differences in the cognitive development of inmates. More recent applications, like the TTM (transtheoretical model), a hybrid of behavioral and Bandurian social influences, has indicated progress in the care and nurture of inmates. The Prisonindustrial complex, monocultural and cultural dichotomization tends to affect treatment.

Within this context, this study examined diversity fundraising practices at four public research universities. The study focused on organizational structures for diversity fundraising, connections between institutional commitment and diversity fundraising efforts, prioritization of diversity fundraising goals and initiatives, and the roles of advisory boards and other constituents in diversity fundraising. More specifically, four questions guided the inquiry: (1) What organizational structures for diversity fundraising are in place at each institution? (2) Is there a discernable connection between institutional commitment and diversity fundraising efforts? (3) What are priority diversity fundraising goals and initiatives at each institution? and (4) What role do advisory boards and other constituents play in diversity fundraising at each institution? The universities participating in this multi-case study were four public research institutions on the West Coast. Senior fundraising officers were interviewed utilizing Seidman's interviewing techniques. Qualitative methods (face-to-face interviews) were used to collect the data. The data were analyzed to identify themes, patterns and concerns surrounding diversity fundraising. In the discussion section of the report, the four universities were categorized by using Cheatham's Institutional Awareness and Cultural Diversity Planning Scale. For each of the following nine Scale indicators, each university was categorized as ""Monocultural,"" ""Nondiscriminatory,"" or ""Multicultural"": Relationship to Other Missions, Planning Process, Constituencies Served, Staffing, Conflict Resolution, Evaluation Procedures, Budgetary Support, Programming, and Management. The study concludes with a set of recommendations for enhancing diversity fundraising efforts at institutions of higher education.

The group was composed of five children, all of different cultural backgrounds, four of whom arrived in this country as non-speakers of English. The aim of this study was to examine through observation, interviews, and artifacts the ways these students struggled to understand, speak, read, and write in English and how well they ""learned the ropes"" of their school culture, if at all. Taking a sociocultural/constructivist stance, the study included a focus on multicultural theory and best practices, as well as the connections among immigration, assimilation, and identity. The research aimed to situate the students in different social contexts within the school. It looked at the students' interactions with their peers, teachers and other adults, viewing the students as active creators of their own knowledge, and the growth of literacy as deeply rooted in embodied experience and situated action. To this end, the larger situated context of school literacy practices included sweeping changes that the adoption of Reading First initiatives in the second year of this study made in those practices. The study provides an in-depth descriptive analysis of how four first grade English language learners, together with an American-born peer, coped with the demands of an urban school in trying to learn how to read. It fills in a number of gaps in the literature: it deals with refugee groups about which little is known, deals with multicultural rather than monocultural group issues, and does this using a constructivist lens. In addition it provides a picture of a school before and after Reading First and how English language learners and their teachers can be affected by new mandated programs and teaching methods.

The multicultural version of the training program emphasized the cultural context of psychology in all areas of training, whereas cultural context was de-emphasized in the monocultural version of the program. Although the cultural content of the 2 training programs was effectively manipulated as indicated by a fidelity check by an outside expert, there were no significant differences between the effects of the 2 programs on the outcomes measured in this study. The primary differences in this study were between students who did versus those who did not participate in a training program.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) As we near the end of the 21st century's first decade, organizational leaders face a unique set of circumstances. The expansion of global capitalism has changed the very structure and scope of many organizations, transforming them from local to transnational, monocultural to multicultural. In addition to the changing economic landscape, globalization has effected profound shifts in the way that culture is imagined, transmitted, and consumed within the global landscape. As the contributors to this fine volume have demonstrated, the ability to recognize and respond to this new cultural milieu stands as one of the primary challenges of organizational leaders. To respond to these conditions in ways that yield more safe, humane, and productive organizations, several challenges lay before us.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The present study investigated the effects of contact with Gypsies on prejudice and its affective and cognitive components in their Italian classmates. Via a repeated measure quasi-experimental design multicultural classes that also included Gypsy children were compared with monocultural classes made up only of Italian children. A questionnaire was distributed at the beginning and at the end of the school year to the same pupils (n = 133). Main results indicate that, at the beginning of the school year, evaluation of Gypsies is more positive in the multicultural classes but worsens over the school year while it remains stable in monocultural classes. Over the school year perception of parents' attitude and positive emotions toward Gypsies also decrease in multicultural classes whereas negative emotions remain the same. At the end of the school year pupils from all classes report greater school difficulties due to the presence of Gypsy children in class, decrease social interactions with them and have a less positive Gypsy stereotype. These negative effects on school integration are discussed in light of the psychosocial literature on interethnic contact effects.

The study is a direct response to the under-representation of students from linguistically diverse backgrounds in nursing education, the call for greater diversity in the nursing workforce and profession, and the issue of ever-increasing numbers of students entering college as English language learners. Employing interpretive phenomenological methodology, participants engaged, in open-ended, hermeneutic interviews which yielded new understandings of everyday concerns that impact their academic success. A critical theoretical framework applied during data analysis exposed power structures impacting student experience across language, culture, classroom practices, and socioeconomics. Four themes emerged from interviews with six participants at an urban community college in the Northeast. These themes include the ways in which students make adjustments, overcome doubts, demonstrate determination, and co-create community. Findings suggest that the key to participants' academic progress involves additional academic learning time dedicated to studying the English language, along with learning the language of health care and nursing concepts. Findings also reveal that students experienced classroom environments as uneven and unequal; some classes fostered learning and the development of higher order thinking skills while others did not. Traditional and monocultural practices, representing acts of power and dominance, thwarted learning and possibly contributed to lack of progress. Yet participants also articulated learning gains despite challenges presented by less effective pedagogical practices and socioeconomic realities. Finally, this query initially related to a notion of identity but expanded to participants' perceptions of ""being-in-the-world,"" their sense of wholeness, and to future endeavors. Faced with myriad inequalities and missed opportunities in the classroom, a pattern of hope and possibility was also revealed as central to participants' outlook as each suggested ways to enhance teaching and learning in the nursing classroom and beyond. This study counters the dominant perception that students without a greater command of English are not ready for the rigors of nursing education. The study, therefore, offers specific recommendations to faculty, policy makers, and students for creating inclusive classroom practices and keeping the doors to nursing education open to students developing English proficiency.

The notion of the missionary's incarnational bonding process has been of great concern in my own personal life, as well as in the cross-cultural missionary world. This study uses the Brewsters' concept of bonding as a starting point and develops it further in order to enhance the effectiveness of cross-cultural adjustment and develop a field-based training model. This study consists of three parts. The first part investigates and develops the incarnational bonding theory from Biblical and missiological perspectives. The second part explores the effect of culture-the missionary's own and that of his receptors'-on cross-cultural adjustment. Based upon the discoveries in the second part, the third part develops a model of field-based training that is relevant for missionaries, particularly those from a Korean background of monocultural, monolingual and monoethnic homogeneity. I utilized mixed methodologies in my research design, taking a qualitative and quantitative approach to collect the necessary data in order to investigate three components: the missionary's effective incarnational bonding process and its relationship to cultural adjustment; how the missionary's own culture and that of his receptors affects the process; and, finally, what sort of innovative field-based training model would most effectively enhance the missionary's cross-cultural communication. The research produced three findings: incarnational bonding is a phenomenon that is necessary for and critical to cross-cultural missionary endeavors; the missionary's understanding of his own culture is even more significant and applicable to the incarnational bonding process in the context of a cross-cultural setting; and a field-based missionary training model must be developed further in order to enhance the carrying out of the Great Commission.

Simultaneously, and without recognizing any serious contradiction, officers exhort indigena recruits to adopt a mestizo masculinity and pledge loyalty to the uninational Patria over their ethnic groups. Indigenous men and their families, on the other hand, deem conscription an important and worthy endeavor on multiple levels. Most are keen to obtain the legal benefits of military service: employment, education, travel, banking, and voting rights are all tied to conscription. However, they also embrace important aspects of the Army's gendered and racialized justifications of military service as a gateway to full citizenship, dominant masculinity, and military status. National discourses about conscription are therefore part of a hegemonic process where closely intertwined notions of Indianness, manhood, and the nation are communicated, interpreted, and legitimated (or less frequently modified or refuted) by Indians and mestizos alike. Military service is also a lived experience-a successful, but fragile hegemonic product-directed by the armed forces, who use this consent, as well as subtle coercion, to compel young men to comply. Once they are in service, conscripts undergo multiple rites of passage that transform them from ""civilians"" into ""new citizens"" and eventually ""new men"" as patriots and reservists. This requires reshaping conscripts in every sense: physically, civically, morally, intellectually, and militarily. Hence, recruits learn not only basic combat skills, but also a host of good habits, values, and beliefs collectively known as ""personal formation."" All recruits are subjected to this process, grounded in mestizo notions of manhood, regardless of their ethnicity. As a result, once they are ""properly"" formed, indigenas are considered culturally improved but not de-Indianized and mestizos have learned to distinguish positive and negative aspects of indigineity. After the young men undergo appropriate rites of passage, they serve as marginal soldiers, tangential to the armed defense of the country, but essential to the day-to-day functioning of the Army as well as their secondary missions of promoting national development and unity. Together, these discursive and tangible aspects of military service help facilitate the indigenous movement and armed force's collective political actions. Yet the Army's notion of multicultural citizenship is never able to resolve its internal paradoxes fully, ultimately limiting its transformative power while simultaneously reinforcing and obscuring indigenas' subordinate roles in the national project.

The conflict between heritage-based citizenship laws and continued demographic changes has especially challenged Germany to reconcile its diverse society with its traditional exclusionary notions of belonging. Citizenship education traditionally needed only prepare those who were citizens to interact with others like them. However in the late 1990s new citizenship and immigration laws officially redefined Germany as an immigrant nation. The political discourse, which has long championed a monocultural view of Germany, began to emphasize integration of immigrants and the preparation of all future citizens for participation in multicultural German and European polities. Whether education policy and practice have likewise expanded to create and enact more inclusive citizenship education has been left unprobed. This dissertation examines, in the case of Bavaria, citizenship education policy at the state-level and the implementation of this policy by individual teachers. Results reveal that state policy expansion towards multiculturalism is bounded by European concepts to the exclusion of non-European German students. Likewise teachers view diversity as positive only in European terms and continue to define and enact citizenship education in ethnocultural terms.

It remains unclear, however, how far these differing cultural myths and policy strategies affect the actual practices of responding to diversity within the curriculum, teaching, and organizational practices of schools. This dissertation investigated the ways in which and extent to which racial and cultural diversity influenced the selection and distribution of official English literature knowledge and teachers' curriculum-in-use in two racially diverse secondary schools, one in Massachusetts, U.S.A., and the other in Ontario, Canada. The theoretical framework drew from two of Bernstein's (1971) message systems of schooling-curriculum, and how weakly or strongly it was classified and framed, as well as school organization. The study employed qualitative research methods of semi-structured, in-depth interviews and documentary analysis of government, school, and teacher level curriculum documents. Data analysis revealed that despite distinct national myths about ethnocultural pluralism of the United States melting pot and the Canadian mosaic, both governments' curriculum policies advocated for monocultural, Eurocentric literature as the foundation of the English curriculum. State and provincial policy that favored classical Western literature was reproduced in English departments which distributed English knowledge according to racially defined academic ability tracks. Academically elite students betwixt and beyond the mainstream studied high status, esoteric English knowledge while their lower skilled, racial minority peers beneath or otherwise outside of the mainstream engaged with lower status, contemporary and multicultural literature. When teaching the official curriculum, teachers' curriculum-in-use often reflected the monocultural nature of the official curriculum. However, many teachers also adopted other texts or otherwise adapted their teaching of mandatory, Eurocentric texts to infuse their classroom curriculum with a more multicultural and even antiracist character. Teachers' abilities to teach in multicultural and antiracist ways were attributed to their professional preparation, formative experiences with diversity, and generational status. Implications for educational policy; teacher education; professional development; school organization; and school, community, departmental, and teacher practice are discussed. Directions for future research are also suggested.

L.: U California, Los Angeles, US","Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences. Vol.68(7-A),2008, pp. 2863.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"The study of educational policy formation and achievement in conditions of social change is illuminating, not only because it highlights the relationship between the priorities of policy and how these work themselves out in practice, but also because it frequently comments on the appropriateness of educational priorities that have become inscribed in policy agendas. Many of the studies of Japan's modern schooling are concerned with the role that education has played in the society's modernization and economic development (Amano, 1990; Hawkins, 1983; Rosenbaum & Kariya, 1989; Rohlen & LeTendre, 1996). Japanese ministry officials have claimed that schools effectively socialize and acculturate the young, transmit modern skills and knowledge, and raise the population's academic achievement based on recent mathematics and science scores (Monbukagakush, 1997; Smuch Tkeikyoku, 1994; TIMSS, 2003). This picture is not invalid, but it is remarkably incomplete and the assumption of equal opportunity in education merits reexamination (Buraku Kaih Kenkyusho, 1983; Okano, 1995). While the post-World War II system of Japanese schooling has provided valuable ingredients for economic success and social stability, these have been accompanied by unfavorable developments. Examples include excessively competitive examinations for entry into education, uniformity that some claim stifles individual development, and monocultural orientations which assume that all students are from a single, Japanese ethnic group (Beauchamp, 1991, 2003). In this manner, the practice of schooling continues to reproduce, rather than eliminate, systemic disadvantages. The overall research question is summarized as follows, what factors of diversity affect mathematics achievement as observed in upper-level (fifth and sixth grade) Japanese elementary schools? This is articulated on three levels: (1) institutional, (2) sector, and (3) individual. The factors of diversity investigated in this analysis of the Japanese educational system are mathematics instruction, socioeconomic background, sociocultural identity, family/community involvement, geographical location, gender, and ethnicity. Mathematics scores are utilized as the dependent variable and a measurable benchmark of achievement obtained through standardized tests and assessment. All findings are supported by quantitative and qualitative data. Research was conducted at Wakabadai Elementary, Inagi Daiichi Elementary, Takashima Daigo Elementary, and Nichinken Juku. Throughout dissertation research, I concurrently enrolled in seminars as a Visiting Scholar at the University of Tky and maintained connections with the four research sites. This provided complementary macroperspective analysis and access to databases at the national level, as well as hands-on learning within the classroom environment. This research is a cooperative project, supported by the University of Tkyo, Waseda University, birin University, and UCLA.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This third paper on older people nursing and spirituality moves beyond the literature reviewed in the two previous papers, exploring directions for the practice and continuing research in this field. Issues of chronic illness challenge nurses working with older people to focus on continuing health promotion and opportunities for spiritual promotion of resilience and transcendence. The changes from monocultural to multicultural societies challenge nurses to know how to provide culturally and faith appropriate care. The extension of palliative care to the needs of those growing older and dying is noted as an important area for developing spiritual care. It is asserted that spiritual assessment forms a basis for the provision of spiritual care for all of these themes. Ethical perspectives of older people nursing must be carefully addressed as frail and vulnerable older people struggle with issues of compromised autonomy. Further research should focus on spirituality as seen through the eyes of older people and examine the interface between nurses and patients, where the relationship becomes the guiding basis for practice. Education in nursing courses and through continuing programmes of education is needed to ensure adequate understanding of spirituality in the nursing role.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter examines transitions from a monocultural perspective toward a multicultural perspective embodied in a model for education, training, and professional practice in psychology. A rich history of Child and Adolescent Service System Program advocacy, followed by exemplars, demonstrations, practice models and guidelines, chronicled the development and implementation of a multicultural perspective. The development of a multicultural perspective was accompanied by an increasing diversity of students, faculty, and professional service providers. At present, however, multicultural education is imperfectly represented in professional psychology training programs and by services in the public and private sectors. The recent Cube Model is a contemporary stimulus toward more coherent, comprehensive, and competency-oriented education in training programs incorporating a multicultural perspective. The Cube Model foundational domain of individual and cultural diversity was fleshed out by an expansion of the counseling psychology triadic training model to include California Brief Multicultural Competence Scale (CBMCS) measurement of a fourth factor, Sociocultural Diversities. This new factor extends the conceptualization of multicultural competency to include multiple identities and contexts represented by the poor, aged, disabled, gender, and gay/lesbian populations. The CBMCS is one component of the Multicultural Assessment-Intervention Process (MAIP) practice model for systematically including multicultural issues in services and service delivery. A multicultural competency training model complements the Cube Model by articulating components germane to multicultural education. These components address implementation within training programs by selection of students, more comprehensive competency-oriented training employing diverse modalities, and routine evaluation of educational-training outcomes. Two illustrative programs suggest how these components can be incorporated into graduate training. These programs articulate both the difficulties and the promise of training agendas that incorporate both Cube Model components and CBMCS/MAIP procedures into multicultural education.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(create) Provides a detailed description of the professional behavioral health resources within psychology, social work, nursing, psychiatry, and medicine in the United States. Each discipline functions autonomously within a general system of monocultural rules and expectations. Although these disciplines all provide behavioral health services to multicultural clients, their professional resources were developed in isolation from one another for homogeneous mainstream populations. The extent of considering cultural competency initiatives for multicultural populations within each profession was determined by self-scrutiny, or ""reflexivity,"" within a larger context of hierarchal status, special interests, disparate objectives, and membership needs. Values of autonomy and self-sufficiency inherent in each discipline minimized formal interdisciplinary exchange of ideas or partnering in the development of complementary training experiences for professional practice with diverse populations. This chapter examines overarching education and training considerations in these professional disciplines that have sustained historic monocultural activities and minimized reflexivity in the development of multicultural perspectives. These considerations have placed limits on the (a) scientific premises and activities providing a coherent basis of knowledge for practice; (b) discipline permeability for racial/ethnic minorities and balanced representation by gender; and (c) openness of the discipline to cross-cultural exchange of ideas, practices, and working alliances on a global basis. For each professional discipline, basic scientific premises and activities are examined within a context of racial/ethnic minority and gender representation. These disciplines occupy different positions on dimensions of science, critical membership ratios for minorities and gender, and especially on the extent of transition from monocultural to multicultural perspectives. Globalization has dramatically affected international communication, information exchange, and cooperative affiliations. These professional disciplines have responded differently to globalization. Global outreach is at different levels of prioritization and development within each profession. This chapter identifies common themes and problems across disciplines that curtail increased respect and cooperative interdisciplinary alliances national and international objectives.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Editorial,"In this issue of the Journal, Pinkham et al. (see record 2008-06006-020) report findings on own-race and other-race effects in their research on facial recognition in schizophrenia. The authors found that the capacity to recognize and remember emotions in faces is no different between Caucasians and African Americans, whether they have schizophrenia or not. But memory for the faces and discrimination of emotions in them are higher when the study subject is of the same race as the person expressing the facial emotion. As did the mental health report on culture, race, and ethnicity from former Surgeon General David Satcher, this study underscores the unfortunate reality that ""monocultural ethnocentrism"" continues to pervade ""good science"" in psychiatric research. Aside from the important scientific information Pinkham et al. have elicited, for me this study's greatest contribution to the literature is in showing why, despite legitimate reasons for being suspicious of research, African Americans need to volunteer to participate in research studies and why scientists need to diversify the culture, race, and ethnicity of their research subjects. Until researchers learn to correct the problems emphasized in Guthrie's book Even the Rat Was White, our science will be lacking.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of age in work teams on short-term team consequences, such as satisfaction, involvement, mutual learning, decision making and feedback, and long-term team consequences, such as quality, sick leave and burnout, and to consider their implications for team management and human resource management (HRM) policies in team-based organizations facing an ageing work force. Design/methodology/approach: The study elaborates on the framework of Milliken and Martins, further examining the effects of both average age and age differences. The authors collected objective data as well as data through questionnaires among 150 work teams with more than 1,500 white-collar and blue-collar workers from an automotive company in Sweden. With these data the authors conducted correlation and step-by-step hierarchical regression analyses. Findings: The analyses showed significant positive effects of average age on both short-term and long-term consequences. No significant effects of age differences were found. Research limitations/implications: Conducting a longitudinal study in an automotive company in Sweden resulted in monocultural findings. The use of a sample from one organization may limit the generalization of our findings. Future research should pay more attention to effects of age in teams, compared to individual age effects in organizations and to explore more advanced models that help to understand the dynamic processes of age in teams. Practical implications: The results have implications for management of teams and HRM policy in organizations relating to recruitment, early retirement, training developments and team composition in general. Originality/value: The paper suggests positive effects of age in work teams and contributes to the literature about the ageing workforce working in teams.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study examined acculturative stress and self-esteem as mediators of the association of ethnic identity and acculturation with psychosocial outcomes. The study sample consisted of 347 Hispanic adolescents in a ""new"" immigrant-receiving community in the Midwest. The authors expected acculturation to influence psychosocial adjustment through acculturative stress and ethnic identity to influence psychosocial adjustment through self-esteem. Results indicated that relationships of ethnic identity to academic grades and to externalizing symptoms were mediated by self-esteem and that both U.S. and Hispanic acculturation orientations were directly associated with prosocial behavior. The relationships of U.S. cultural orientation to academic grades and to behavior problems were mediated through acculturative stress and self-esteem. Implications of these findings for the study of Hispanics in more monocultural receiving communities are discussed.

Which aspects of the host culture do they consider important for their children to adopt?); and (3) specific life circumstances that may relate to the development of monocultural versus bicultural orientations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"To explore the possible cognitive consequences of biculturalism, the authors examine the complexity of cultural representations in monocultural and bicultural individuals. Study 1 found that Chinese American biculturals' free descriptions of both American and Chinese cultures are higher in cognitive complexity than that of Anglo-American monoculturals, but the same effect was not apparent in descriptions of culturally neutral entities (landscapes). With the same procedures, Study 2 found that the cultural representations of biculturals with low levels of Bicultural Identity Integration (BII; or biculturals with conflicted cultural identities) are more cognitively complex than that of biculturals with high BII (biculturals with compatible cultural identities). This article shows that cultural frame switching and BII have meaningful cognitive consequences; furthermore, it suggests that exposure to more than one culture may increase individuals' ability to detect, process, and organize everyday cultural meaning, highlighting the potential benefits of multiculturalism.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article discusses a study that examined cultural frame switching among bicultural Greek participants living in the Netherlands. The research demonstrated that self-evaluations, self-stereotypes, and attitudes toward family integrity and friendship were affected by cultural framing. Experimentally primed bicultural participants and monocultural comparison groups in the Netherlands and Greece were used. Activating Greek culture especially, in comparison to activating Dutch culture, led to a less positive evaluation of the personal self, stronger Greek self-stereotyping, and stronger endorsement of family integrity and friendship. Similar differences were found when comparing monocultural Dutch and monocultural Greek participants. In addition, cultural priming affected group identification, which was found to be associated with perceptions and attitudes. The pattern of results suggests that group identification, in part, mediates the relationship between cultural framing and perceptual and evaluative responses. It is concluded that social identity principles are important for understanding the experiences of bicultural individuals.

Mixed-race individuals defy conventional monocultural and monoracial paradigms of understanding identity, and it is imperative that social workers examine the many factors that contribute to the cultural identity of the multiracial person. Through the collection of narrative stories, this qualitative study explored some of the numerous factors that shape a multiracial individual's cultural identity. Purposive sampling methods were employed to recruit a non-clinical sample of 10 multiracial individuals who reside in the Western New York area. Participants were encouraged to share their individual experiences and tell their own unique stories as related to their cultural identity through a narrative interview process (Stuhlmiller, 2001). Results from transcript analysis verify that the cultural identity of multiracial persons is highly complex and significantly influenced by: (1) personal experiences of racism and discrimination; (2) social interactions and relationships with peers and family; and (3) the racial climate of the environment (i.e., schools and neighborhoods). In addition, this study also identified several themes which provide us with a better understanding of what it is like to be a multiracial person. Finally, this study confirmed that certain models of multiracial identity development (those which are more fluid, strength-based and ecological) proved to be more sensitive and therefore more inclined to explicate some of the more complex and highly influential contextual factors that impact a multiracial person's cultural identity development. The findings from this study can help strengthen the therapeutic relationship with multiracial clients throughout the assessment and treatment phases of clinical therapy.

This study examined the influence of societal and cultural factors in the development of teachers' conceptions of social justice, and the impact of their conceptions upon the design and implementation of school improvement initiatives. The research attempted to answer four questions: (a) How do teachers conceive of social justice as it relates to their students? (b) How do these conceptions influence the teachers' practices and the design and implementation of school improvement initiatives? (c) What are the school improvement initiatives which were designed and implemented by the teachers? and (d) How do these initiatives attempt to address distributive and cultural injustices? The conceptual model developed for the study illustrated the influence of monocultural and multicultural perspectives of education (Fleras and Elliott, 2003), discourses of academic achievement and failure (Gale and Densmore, 2000), and distributive and cultural paradigms of justice (Fraser, 1997; Young, 1990) upon the formation of teachers' conceptions of social justice and upon the design and implementation of the school improvement initiatives attempted at one school during the years 1998-2005. The research was designed as a case study focusing on one secondary school in a large urban centre in Manitoba. Data were collected from one focus group interview and two individual interviews conducted with each of four teacher participants and one principal. These data, as well as data from school documents and the researcher's field notes, were used to explore insights provided by examination of the teachers' perceptions of social contexts and phenomena relevant to the research questions. The research suggested that the participants' conceptions of social justice were dominated by monocultural views of education that were influenced by discourses of deficit and disadvantage. The school improvement initiatives designed and implemented by the teachers at the school appeared affirmative rather than transformative in nature, resulting in changes that may have contributed to the maintenance of the educational status quo. Some evidence was found indicating the presence of conditions considered to be precursors to actions of a more transformative nature. These conditions involved teacher dispositions consistent with a multicultural view of education. Implications for action stemming from this study include increasing the engagement of school personnel in activities and processes designed to expose and eliminate the stasis-inducing effects of monocultural views of education upon the attainment of social justice in education. The challenge for future research is to identify factors that will encourage transformative change in schools.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"To improve the quality in teaching and learning, opportunities need to be provided where practitioners and researchers meet and share visions, disseminate findings, co-construct ideas, and set research agendas together. Visiting a conference is one well-known and established way to do this. But are they effective? A survey was conducted among the attendants of 15 practice-oriented and research-oriented conferences (N = 490) with monocultural and mixed audiences held in The Netherlands in 2005. The findings suggest that, although conferences provide formal and informal opportunities for interdisciplinary dialogues, intradisciplinary meetings are prominent. Most encounters are aimed at the dissemination of information. To a lesser extent, people exchange materials, co-create knowledge, and set research agendas. The conferences sustain traditional role divisions in which researchers present and practitioners consume. To improve the interactivity between researchers and practitioners at conferences, new web-based interaction formats are discussed.

Bicultural participants of Greek descent who live in the Netherlands were randomly primed with either Greek or Dutch cultural symbols and language. A monocultural Dutch group in the Netherlands and a monocultural Greek group in Greece, were involved as control groups. Structural equation modeling indicated that the Greek participants in Greece and the bicultural participants primed with Greek culture had a similar pattern of associations. This pattern differed from that of the Dutch participants and the participants primed with Dutch culture. Thus, the two different monocultural association patterns were replicated among bicultural individuals. The findings show that meanings are affected by cultural frame-switching, and provide further support for the dynamic constructivist approach.

Constantine and Derald Wing Sue (see record 2005-03260-000). The objective of this volume is also to help the field of psychology to move from a monocultural model to a multicultural one. To achieve this task, a group of highly respected professionals, most of whom are psychologists, joined together as authors of the chapters of this book. The content of this volume is excellent for educational purposes. Moreover, the content areas of the different chapters can be a stimulus for further research and investigational efforts within the context of multicultural competence and treatment interventions. In essence, this text offers a foundation for culturally sensitive assessment, counseling, and therapy, as well as the possibility of organizational change based on this type of conceptual framework.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the introduction) The author examines the modes by which a generation of scholars has established race and sexuality as mutually constitutive. Interrogating the work of the axiomatic in confining such epistemological interventions in queer studies to the dead category of ""self-evident truths,"" the author insists that ""intersections"" be rigorously historicized rather than merely asserted as structural. This process involves fracturing dominant narratives of both sexual and racial formation, as well as their imbrications, to expose forgotten or incomplete sites of mutual construction. The author's project is to reanimate intersectionality, both refusing it as an already constituted category and refusing to abandon it. The study of racialized sexualities, in this framing, revises Foucauldian histories of sexuality and reworks the relationships between sexuality and epistemology and between sexuality and power. In entwined genealogies of the intersectional analyses that have historicized racial formations and monocultural Foucauldian histories of sexuality, the author forcefully elaborates the ways in which race rewrites the history (and present future) of sexuality studies.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) This chapter describes The Critical Moments Project from its origins in the Goodrich Scholarship Program at the University of Nebraska at Omaha to its evolution as a campus equity and engagement initiative in Washington State. Drawing on students' accounts of personal experiences in higher education, Critical Moments identifies those patterns of inequity, often buried in the details of ordinary campus life, that need to be uncovered and challenged if students of color, in particular, are to feel at home in higher education. Students are interviewed; their experiences are written as case stories; these stories, in turn, become starting points for discussions in classrooms and other campus settings. The Critical Moments Project weaves together successful educational practices--problem-posing education, case teaching methodology, conceptual frameworks from ethnic studies, and learning in the context of diverse communities. The project privileges underrepresented students' voices: First, to make public their experiences in higher education; second, to interrogate collectively the sources of oppression embedded in these experiences; and third, to transform a monocultural academy into one where every student's cultural identity is welcomed and honored. Throughout the project, critical thinking--the ability to analyze personal experience through critical, social analyses--becomes the means for transforming institutional policies and practices.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The present study compares adolescents' contribution to mealtime conversations in U.S. American, Estonian, Swedish Estonian and Swedish middle-class families. To that end, mealtime interactions at homes were videotaped and later analyzed in respect to talkativeness and conversational intents (to control the conversational partner's behavior or to elicit his/her talk). Similarly to their mothers, the American and Swedish teenagers were found to talk more than the Estonian teenagers. Furthermore, the Swedish teenagers differed from other teenagers by the use of biggest amount of behavioral directives addressed toward their mothers. Conversation-eliciting style was typical of American teens and their mothers, whereas the directive conversational style was characteristic only of the monocultural Estonian mothers. Our results support the notion that ways of using language during family conversations are culture-specific, and teenagers from different sociocultural backgrounds differ in respect of how active participants in family conversations they are. Our findings indicated more symmetrical communication in the U.S. American and Swedish monolingual families than, for example, in Estonian monolingual families. These results appear to reflect differences in child rearing styles. Finally, possible reasons for cultural variations in family socialization patterns (differences in child-rearing values and goals, different practices and meanings of talking, strict control, etc.) and some of their consequences, will be discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The labor market in Sweden today does not offer a rosy picture for young people. Among them are youth with a migrant background that have the lowest chance of becoming employed. In principle migrant background should work in favor of young people. After all, even if they are born in the country their parents migrated to, they have knowledge of at least two cultures and two languages, and are thus more flexible than monocultural people. However, instead of being credited with specific capabilities, young people of a migrant background are seen as deficient. It is a battlefield with its contradictory value systems, its unpredictable requirements and its poor possibilities for young people's employment, which the young person with a migrant background enters in order to make her/his way into Swedish society. How young people see their future, the ways in which they make sense of and deal with the possibilities and constraints they encounter, decides ""in the last instance"" what kind of life they will lead. As opposed to an individual heroism, many young migrants interviewed showed an unusual commitment to social issues. This was unusual in so far as it distinguished them from young people without an experience of migration. This was different for many young people with a migrant background who often envisaged making a difference also for others.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Each cultural context imposes a different meaning on peace and conflict. Strategic thinking about conflict resulting from terrorism must accommodate the many different culturally learned interpretations of each cultural context to achieve peace. Any adequate interpretation of peace and war must be multicultural in accommodating the many cultures involved (Pedersen, 2001). The simplistic monocultural alternative of ""declaring victory and returning home"" has not worked and has led to escalating world conflicts (Manwaring & Joes, 2000). This chapter will address three themes originally identified by Fry and Bjorkqvist (1997). The first theme is that there are alternatives to violence, which challenges the prevailing belief in Western cultures that aggression and warfare are inevitable consequences of conflict. Culture-bound Westernized assumptions will be challenged and alternative perspectives will be suggested. The second theme is the importance of culture in shaping how people perceive, evaluate, and act out options when dealing with conflict. Different cultures have developed their own formal and informal ways of handling conflict. The third theme is to enhance the repertoire of alternatives to violence and present a generalized framework for managing conflict in its cultural context. The importance of patterns in the cultural construction of conflict and peace will be highlighted.

In a sample of 174 bicultural undergraduates, level of bicultural competence moderated the effects of an ""existential"" aspect of depression (i.e., the sense of a foreshortened future) in predicting both expressive flexibility during wakefulness and emotional flux within the content of impactful dreams. Among individuals high in bicultural competence, those who sensed a foreshortened future following loss or trauma were more likely to report: (1) feeling exploration through direct self-reflection; (2) feeling exploration through aesthetic response; and (3) spontaneous emotional flux within impactful dreams. These findings suggest that expressive flexibility among biculturally competent individuals becomes evident in their manner of identifying, understanding, and expressing emotions during a stressful life event.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The goal of this chapter is to illustrate the efforts of one academic department to change from an ethnocentric to a multicultural organization. The authors describe an evolution of organizational diversity and individual experiences in a department of counseling, which is home to a master of arts in counseling and a PhD in counseling psychology, and is staffed by six full-time faculty and two part-time faculty. In the author's department's effort to evolve to an environment where diversity is the norm, they have chosen to explore how multicultural competency impacts their work as a group, as well as their work as individuals. The changes they have made over the last decade reflect the developmental stages of organizational multicultural development described by D. W. Sue (1995): monocultural, nondiscriminatory, and multicultural.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined maternal control of children across families with early adolescents from different sociocultural backgrounds. The intention was to find out whether belonging to the same ethnic group/language community is more important for determination of childrearing attitudes and practices than sharing the immediate sociocultural context. In addition, attention was paid to the relationship between attitudes and behaviour. The results were obtained from three monocultural samples of Estonian, Swedish, and Finnish families living in their country of origin; two bicultural samples consisted of Estonian and Finnish families residing in Sweden. Two types of data--mothers' reported attitudes towards the importance of control over children's behaviour and video-recorded real-life verbal behaviour were used to determine how the mothers' attitudes towards control relate to the behavioural control exhibited in their real-life interactions. The study showed that the Finno-Ugric mothers living in their countries of origin controlled their children's behaviour significantly more frequently than those Finno-Ugric mothers who live in Sweden, but both Estonian samples outperformed Finns in their reported control attitudes...

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2004-10574-014.) Biracial girls face all the developmental challenges of growing up female and the additional challenge of forging an identity in a society that presses them to choose a monocultural existence and disavow part of their ethnic heritage. Existing literature raises several potential issues for biracial girls in terms of identity development, social and sexual relationships, and family. Therapist ethnic awareness, client physical appearance, reasons for seeking treatment, level of identity development, and environmental considerations are discussed. Therapists are encouraged to offer a sociopolitical perspective, promote biracial/bicultural identity development, assist biracial girls in connecting with a multicultural community, and work collaboratively with parents in fostering the positive development of biracial girls.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The relations among language acculturation, biculturality, and psychological adjustment were studied in a sample of 54 young mainland Puerto Rican mothers. Participants were interviewed in the language of their choice concerning their level of symptomatology (i.e., depression, anxiety, somatization, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity), language acculturation, monocultural involvement (assessed by separate adherence to American and Puerto Rican cultural values), and dual cultural involvement (assessed by a combination of cultural values). Results indicated that biculturality significantly predicted adjustment above and beyond monocultural involvement. In addition, although biculturality and bilingualism were both significantly related to psychological adjustment, linguistic balance showed a stronger association with adjustment than biculturality. Findings are discussed in light of the family, cultural, and developmental context in which young mainland Puerto Rican mothers are embedded.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examines cultural frame switching among bicultural Greek children (n=74; aged 9-12 yrs) living in the Netherlands. By means of experimentally primed bicultural children and the, use of monocultural comparison groups in the Netherlands (n=51) and Greece (n=58), it was demonstrated that social explanations, self- identification, and attitudes toward family integrity and obedience were affected by cultural identity salience. Compared to Dutch identity salience, activating Greek identity especially led to more external attributions, stronger identification with friends, a more positive evaluation of social identity, and a less positive evaluation of personal identity. Similar tendencies were found for the attitude measures. In addition, similar differences were found when comparing monocultural Dutch and monocultural Greek children. It is concluded that this kind of experimental study and its results help to improve our understanding of the experiences of bicultural individuals and the way culture influences people's lives.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The chapters that compose Volume One of the Handbook collectively represent the work of psychologists and social scientists who have struggled to transform psychology from a monocultural White American scientific and applied discipline to a profession that includes multiple racial-cultural perspectives and worldviews. Although the hegemony of Western psychological concepts persists within the larger field of psychology, the theoretical developments and bodies of research reviewed in this volume provide confirmation that change is needed. It is apparent that the racial and cultural revolution in psychology has a long way to go. We believe that this is because it is difficult to consider the reality of people whose socialization and experience are different from one's own. From the perspective of oneself or one's own racial-cultural group it can seem axiomatic and self-evident that the filter one used to view one's experience and environment is shared by all of humanity. Cultural difference, when it has been addressed by the social sciences, has primarily focused on variations in dress and other physical manifestations of explicit customs that are readily apparent. It has been more difficult to discern the aspects of culture that are less visible, such as communication styles, thought patterns, and feelings. Therefore, we commend the tremendous effort of the contributing authors who have taken on the challenge of elucidating these veiled and unspoken aspects of race and culture.

People from different cultures use private and collective selves with different probabilities, as has been empirically demonstrated through self-definition tests such as the Twenty Statement Test (Kuhn & Mc Partland, 1954; Trafimow et al. 1991). Bicultural individuals, by virtue of their exposure to two dominant cultures and worldviews (such as offspring of immigrants from collectivistic cultures), are capable of displaying both kinds of self-concepts (Cross, 1991, Singelis, 1994). Dual self-concepts in biculturals are not well understood. The current study examines the collective self-concept in a bicultural sample (offspring of South Asian immigrants to North America) through direct comparison with a monocultural sample (individuals of mainly Northern European ancestry) in a self-priming paradigm. Previous self-priming studies (Trafimow, Triandis & Goto, 1991) have transiently invoked the two self-concepts (private and collective) using various priming techniques. Self-priming effects have not been studied in a bicultural sample. In this study, following the self-prime manipulation two tasks (Twenty Statement Test, Miller's Social Judgment Task) sensitive to cross-cultural differences were administered. The two major findings were: (1) Effects elicited due to culture were stronger than those elicited by the prime. Regardless of prime conditions, biculturals endorsed significantly more group cognitions and fewer idiocentric cognitions than monoculturals. (2) A self priming effect often observed in previous studies (Trafimow, 1991; Gardner, 1999) was replicated with biculturals, but not with monoculturals. The findings suggest that biculturals have a more well elaborated collective self-concept compared to monoculturals.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Cognitive dissonance and effects of self-affirmation on dissonance arousal were examined cross-culturally. In Studies 1 and 2, European Canadians justified their choices more when they made them for themselves, whereas Asian Canadians (Study 1) or Japanese (Study 2) justified their choices more when they made them for a friend. In Study 3, an interdependent self-affirmation reduced dissonance for Asian Canadians but not for European Canadians. In Study 4, when Asian Canadians made choices for a friend, an independent self-affirmation reduced dissonance for bicultural Asian Canadians but not for monocultural Asian Canadians. These studies demonstrate that both Easterners and Westerners can experience dissonance, but culture shapes the situations in which dissonance is aroused and reduced. Implications of these cultural differences for theories of cognitive dissonance and self-affirmation are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Vocabulary acquisition is a critical component of academic language. This aspect of the school curriculum seems to be more difficult for language learners to acquire. This study therefore examines the language arts conceptual framework and the instructional activities for vocabulary development in a second grade mixed classroom with a view to evaluate how language learning conceptualization and instructional practices accommodate specific well-established theoretical, practical and pedagogical issues underpinning English language teaching/learning. Drawing on insights from the theories of the sociocultural approach and critical language pedagogy, I reviewed the Reading/Language Arts Framework for its provisions for language learners. In addition, I observed a vocabulary lesson in a second grade class. The study reveals that the conceptual framework sets the stage for vocabulary instruction to foster monolingual and monocultural American society despite the fact that second grade classrooms in Los Angeles metropolitan city contain learners of dynamic and sometimes conflicting identities, needs, preferences, interests and aspiration. Furthermore, the study shows that the tight control of the teacher on instructional activities and the structured nature of the lesson did not create a conducive atmosphere for language learners to appropriate other pupils' voices and identities.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Comment/Reply,"Reply by the current author to the comments made by Lynne Layton (see record 2005-11948-006) on the original article (see record 2005-11948-005). Iam most grateful to Lynne Layton for her thoughtful and learned discussion of ""Between Arrogance and a Dead End."" In that article I examined the pitfalls, respectively, of the right and the left in postmodern politics. Here, in my response to Layton's discussion, I try to sketch out and illustrate through clinical examples how, from the beginning, we might think differently about psychotherapy in order to avoid the excesses of both the right's monocultural arrogance and the left's moral relativism. Layton focuses mainly on the first error, which I appreciate. My overall point, however, is that the two errors can be effectively avoided only by attending to both at once, because ultimately they are expressions of the same philosophical problem and must be addressed in the same way: by a wholehearted embrace of a more fully thought out hermeneutic vision. In her discussion Layton searches for ways of integrating into therapeutic practice realizations about how the larger institutions, arrangements, and ideologies of our social world shape psychological experience. That is a goal of mine as well.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The interpretive turn in the human sciences has profoundly influenced interpersonal, postmodern, and now relational psychoanalysis. Although it has transformed psychotherapy theory in many ways, some important philosophical difficulties have also followed in its wake. In this paper I examine two founders of the interpretive turn, the hermeneuticist Martin Heidegger and the postmodernist Michel Foucault. Practitioners of both theories feature an understanding of human being that is historical or cultural, and yet, admirably, attempt to avoid historical determinism. Some hermeneuticists do so by emphasizing how historical traditions intersect and then affect one another; some postmodernists do so by emphasizing the experiential and heuristic importance of the sociopolitical periphery. I examine these two strategies and their implications for psychotherapy by critiquing Heidegger's involvement in National Socialism and Foucault's limited vision of the moral: Heidegger's monocultural arrogance and Foucault's extreme relativism. I argue that both positions are deficient, and suggest that Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutic concept of dialogue (enhanced with some of Antonio Gramsci's socialism) can remedy both flaws and point the way toward more helpful psychotherapeutic applications of the interpretive turn.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"Reviews the book Pastoral Leadership for Manhood and Womanhood by W. Grudem and D. Rainey (2004). The authors believe that the moral drift and decay prevalent in America today can be changed by strengthening the smallest societal unit, the family. Further, they believe the pastor's personal life and family should reflect and demonstrate health and spiritual integrity. This unit, the pastoral family, must then strengthen and bring health to the next unit of society, the church, and from there, influence local communities. Strengths of this book include the scholarship and experience of outstanding practitioners-authors. These men are not just theorists. The resulting work is very practical and thoroughly Biblical. The authors are consistent in espousing their complementarian view of marriage issues. Weaknesses of the book are the failure to allow for other views of marital roles (do the authors believe that egalitarian views of marriage are wrong?). Another unease I felt was that the male voice is dominant throughout the book (are there no women able to speak on these issues?). Still another concern was the monocultural stance as if there are no other Christian populations in the world, and no other cultures represented in the North American church.

These essays recognize that social relational systems can contain different cultural goals for close relationships and trust. Different social networks provide functionally and relationally different experiences for children as they develop. Lewis emphasizes that the influences of these relationally rich and complex networks can have direct or indirect effects of several kinds. The cultural meaning of relationships affects attachment because cultural communities are interested in socializing children for appropriate trust in particular local cultural and social contexts. Takahashi's Affective Relationship Model illustrates this through the finding that a different pattern of affective relations and different types of preferences are found across contexts and across the life span. The social-relational models in these articles challenge the dyadic attachment theory and offer new methods for the study of emotionally close relations across the life span. They challenge the monocultural assumptions of good development that are also part of classical attachment paradigms, and open up to our view the plural pathways cultural communities provide for the socialization of trust in children.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The present article focused on two types of communicative intent (directing behaviour vs. eliciting talk) expressed by mothers and teenagers during everyday family interactions in Estonian, Finnish, and Swedish mono- and bicultural families. Three monocultural groups consisted of 17 Estonian, 19 Swedish, and 18 Finnish families living in their country of origin; two bicultural and bilingual groups consisted of 18 Estonian and 18 Finnish families residing in Sweden. All the children were between 9.0 and 13.0. The results revealed that the Estonian monocultural mothers were highly directive and direct: issuing behavioural directives most frequently and using the highest proportion of imperatives among all samples. Contrary to our expectations, the mothers who tended to be more concerned with controlling their children's behaviour also elicited conversation more frequently from teenagers by using a larger number of information requests. These requests seemed to serve as another form of attempted control over adolescents' behaviour--their communicative behaviour. The Swedish monocultural children were more active in controlling their mothers' behaviour than their counterparts, possibly illustrating the Swedish value of generational equality.

Three features of self-concept structure were examined-self-concept pluralism, cultural compartmentalization, and self-concept unity. Self-concept pluralism was assessed using Linville's (1985, 1987) measure of self-complexity. Cultural compartmentalization was assessed using a measure adapted from Showers' (1992) research on the compartmentalization of positive and negative self-beliefs. Self-concept unity was assessed using (a) a measure of role integration adapted from Donahue et al.'s (1993) research on self-concept differentiation, (b) Campbell et al.'s (1996) Self-Concept Clarity Scale, and (c) a measure of actual-actual self-discrepancies adapted from Higgins' (1987) research on self-discrepancies. Self-concept pluralism, cultural compartmentalization, self-concept unity, and psychological adjustment were assessed among monocultural and bicultural participants. The monocultural participants were Euro-Canadians and Indians living in India. The bicultural participants were Indo-Canadians. The results indicated that the bicultural participants were higher in cultural compartmentalization, lower in self-concept unity, and lower in psychological adjustment than the monocultural participants. Moreover, the results showed that self-concept unity mediated the relationship between cultural exposure (i.e., monoculturalism vs. biculturalism) and psychological adjustment; lower levels of self-concept unity accounted for lower levels of psychological adjustment among the bicultural participants. Self-concept pluralism, cultural compartmentalization, self-concept unity, and psychological adjustment were also assessed for bicultural participants who used one of five strategies to cope with conflicting cultural expectations of the self-assimilation, separation, alternation, fusion, or marginalization. The results indicated that (a) participants who used alternation (i.e., who adhered to different norms and values in different cultural environments) were higher in cultural compartmentalization, lower in self-concept unity, and lower in psychological adjustment than participants who used other strategies and (b) participants who used fusion (i.e., who consistently adhered to a combination or blend of the norms and values of the dominant culture and the norms and values of their ethnic culture) were higher in self-concept unity and higher in psychological adjustment than participants who used other strategies. Moreover, the results showed that self-concept unity mediated the relationship between the strategies that participants used and psychological adjustment; lower levels of self-concept unity accounted for lower levels of psychological adjustment among participants who used alternation, and higher levels of self-concept unity accounted for higher levels of psychological adjustment among participants who used fusion. The implications of these findings for theories of the psychological impact of biculturalism are discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"New views of biculturalism have transformed the ""melting pot"" vision of American culture to one in which immigrants are encouraged to maintain multicultural diversity rather than assimilate to the dominant culture. Indeed, the marker of bicultural competence is now seen as the ability to display culturally appropriate behaviors in both the new and old cultural settings (e.g., LaFramboise, Coleman, & Gerton, 1993). Recent social cognitive research emphasizing both the shifting nature of the self (e.g., Gardner, Gabriel, & Lee, 1999) and of cultural world-views (e.g., Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martinez, 2000) can illuminate the mechanisms underlying this more dynamic form of biculturalism. The current research demonstrated bicultural flexibility by comparing monocultural (European-American) and bicultural (Asian- American) participants' self-construals, values, and responses to social obligations as a function of the situational accessibility of independent and interdependent self-construal. As expected, Asian-Americans appeared more responsive to the primes than their European-American counterparts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Recent studies of racioethnic differences in job satisfaction have yielded inconsistent results. It is posited that the physical variable race/national origin (synonymous with physioethnicity), that is commonly used to operationalize race/ethnicity, is not sufficiently comprehensive to detect the social and cultural essence of racioethnicity. Thus, this article offers ""so do ethnicity"" as a less observable type of racioethnicity. This delineation of socioethnicity enables the researchers and practitioners to measure the number of cultures with which an individual identifies. Based on previous research findings and grounded in orthogonal cultural identification theory, it is hypothesized that multicultural members of the majority group in a racioethnically diverse work environment will be more satisfied with their coworkers than monocultural members. Results supported the hypothesis.

Existing literature raises several potential issues for biracial girls in terms of identity development, social and sexual relationships, and family. Therapist ethnic awareness, client physical appearance, reasons for seeking treatment, level of identity development, and environmental considerations are discussed. Therapists are encouraged to offer a sociopolitical perspective, promote biracial/bicultural identity development, assist biracial girls in connecting with a multicultural community, and work collaboratively with parents in fostering the positive development of biracial girls.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Students have travelled from one country to another for centuries, particularly in Europe. They have often faced problems: an early study in America, published in 1925, listed difficulties for foreign students over academic issues, language, housing, economic issues, their inability to become socially accepted, health and recreation, and racial prejudice. But it was not until comparatively recently that the foreign student experience became the focus of psychological study. In many cases foreign students do appear to experience more physical and mental ill health than native students, as well as more academic problems. Although there are no grand theories attempting to explain this phenomenon, various concepts have been put forward to predict the quality, quantity and chronicity of sojourner distress. One such concept is the culture-distance concept, which states simply that the absolute amount of difference or distance (defined both objectively and subjectively) between a sojourner's own and the host culture is directly proportionally related to the amount of stress or difficulty experienced. Various friendship networks (monocultural, bicultural, multicultural) serve important psychological functions, which in turn help a sojourner over numerous difficulties.

The proposal is unrealistic, morally questionable, and undesirable. A world in which wise, intelligence, and creative people, however conceived, encourage the development of many types of gifted persons (including emotionally and spiritually gifted and even the gifted who seem bad bets) is more likely to produce a vigorous, interesting, and healthy future than one that follows Sternberg's monocultural proposal.

More specifically it brings attention to a model of plurality in which there is no contradiction between the ""one"" and the ""many"", unity and diversity, communion and otherness. Self theorists are now calling for a dialogue among diverse perspectives, sociohistorical, philosophical, and theological traditions that goes beyond the monocultural and monologic discourse that has dominated modern self theories. Predominant assumptions about identity such as notions of an individualistic, autonomous, unified, monolithic, self, or the overemphasized conscious subject are breaking down. This qualitative inquiry examines two relational conceptualizations: (1) self in relation, ""self in dialogue"" within the context of the ancient Greek world, and (2) an ontology of personhood as prosopon ""person"" that traces back to Cappadocian philosophical/theological thought and later Eastern trinitarian theology and spirituality-as presented primarily in the comprehensive work of twentieth century writer John Zizioulas. The Cappadocian use of trinitarian thought as a means of engaging with the ancient philosophical problem of the ""one and the many"", resulted in a new understanding of human existence in the 4th century A.D. It was a shift from an ontology of essence (revolution with regard to Aristotelian thought) to an ontology of ""communion and love"". To be and to be in relation becomes identical. The ontological question is no longer answered by pointing ""to the self-existent, to a being as it is determined by its own boundaries, but to a being which in its ekstasis breaks through these boundaries in a movement of communion."" It is communion which makes beings ""be"" (Zizioulas, 1975). As an alternate approach to the ""substantialist"" one, it goes beyond individualism and collectivism. Here communion does not lead to collectivistic merging but to the affirmation of identity and distinctiveness in and through personal love. Cappadocian thought anticipates postmodern reactions to modernity's claims to a universal transhistorical and objectified self, yet it does not reduce personal identity to sociohistorical, cultural or linguistic circumstances. Connections with Bakhtin's dialogic self are also discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"In recent times reports into incidents of racist violence in Britain identified a prevailing institutionalized racism and social segregation (Cantle, 2002; MacPherson, 1999). In this article I present an analysis of authoritative educational discourse in the form of school inspection reports, focusing on a single issue: the cultural practice of minority ethnic families visiting their heritage country. Using critical discourse analysis, I suggest that the discourse of the inspection reports racializes the cultural practices of the Asian minority, defining them as the alien and foreign. In this discourse an uncontested, common-sense discourse emerges, which blames minority families for the presupposed harm done to their children's education by visits to the heritage country. I conclude that such cultural practices become an emblem of difference, whereas the dominant ideology in official discourse is one of homogenization. This discourse implies that for minority ethnic families to be part of the imagined community of successful learners in Britain, this cultural practice will have to stop.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Review-Book,"This latest edition (see record 2002-06787-000) offers a contemporary expansion of the definition of multicultural counseling that pushes the boundaries of the field and allows for a more inclusive and meaningful way of looking at and treating diverse populations. The authors have updated the book to include new developments in research, theory, and practice. Major additions include: a more expansive definition of multiculturalism; the most recent statistics on the changing complexion of society; and implications for counseling and clinical practice that these changes have precipitated, which are forcing clinicians to redefine their roles and reeducate themselves on how to tend to these varied populations. The book includes new chapters on counseling biracial/multiracial populations, women, gays/lesbians, the physically challenged, the elderly, and monocultural organizations; a new section in every chapter covering implications for clinical practice; updated chapters on counseling African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. The reviewer concludes that the book combines a sound conceptual framework for multicultural counseling with proven therapeutic methods for specific populations.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) In light of the increasing diversity of our society, health care professionals inevitably will be encountering patient populations, which differ from them in terms of race, culture, and ethnicity. Yet, the theories of health care, the standards used to judge healthy and unhealthy behavior, and the actual delivery of services are culture-bound and reflect a monocultural perspective of the health care professions. As such, the practice of public health is often culturally inappropriate and antagonistic to the lifestyles and values of minority groups in our society. To address these issues, the chapter examines the following topics: ethnocentric monoculturalism; cultural competence of health care providers; overcoming ethnocentric monoculturalism: professional development; developing alternative service provider roles; and learning from indigenous models of healing.

Specifically, the relevance of this study is five-fold. First, it is an exploratory effort in building a much needed preliminarily database on Asian Americans mental health issues. Second, the data collected is essential for clarifying some important assumptions in the growing Asian American literature. Third, the study can provide a baseline of information that allows subsequent research to confirm or contrast proposed theories, and positively for comprehensive theories development. Fourth, the longitudinal perspective of this study can uniquely provide critical information for program planning, public policy making and resource/grant allocation related to either one specific Asian sub-group or collectively as the Asian American cluster. Finally, comparable data about the Asian Americans can be available to shed light on the existing monocultural perspective in psychology. The design of the present study is a longitudinal analysis of archival-based descriptive data set. It is a case analysis of an ethnic-specific Asian Americans community mental health program in Oakland, California. Investigation entails the service utilization records by Asian ethnicity categories as they changed across two decades, 1980 to 2000. It is designed to explore the following six areas among seven Asian American groups: (1) Utilization rate, (2) Referral source, (3) Admission status, (4) Diagnoses, (5) Length of treatment, and (6) Treatment outcome.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Examined the experiences of immigrant nurses residing in Australia. Five immigrant nurses currently residing in New South Wales, Australia, completed interviews concerning their experiences of migration, seeking employment, and gaining re-registration as a nurse. Results show that subjects (Ss) experienced professional negation as a lack of support; otherness, experienced as cultural separateness; and silencing, experienced as language and communication difficulties. Ss also experienced continuing marginalization, were denied participation beyond the lower ranks of nursing, and were undervalued for contributions to multicultural work settings. It is concluded that there is a need for transcultural nursing knowledge to break down monocultural nursing practices.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"""Culture' used to be thought of as a whole, internally consistent system of symbols and values held in common by members of bounded social groups, including whole societies. That view is changing among anthropologists currently. This article traces the intellectual history of those changes, across the earlier perspectives of functionalism and conflict theory, through recent perspectives on culture as residing in the practices of local communities of practice. Both those local social groups and the persons within them are presumed currently to be multicultural rather than monocultural. Implications of this for the study of human development are that (1) acquisition of culture involves apprentice-like interaction in specific communities of practice, and that (2) a key unit of analysis in the study of the acquisition of culture is the indiviudal's encounters with various specific communities of practice in that individual's distinctive daily round. Patterns of culture in whole societies in relation to those in local communities of practice are currently undertheorized.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Notes that despite the fundamental importance of multicultural group work activities in the curriculum, previous literature has shown that home and international students do not spontaneously mix and would rather be involved in monocultural work groups. It is maintained that one of the major causes for this lies in the home students' belief that assessed multicultural group work has a detrimental effect on their individual average mark. Using data from a large cohort (304 Ss) enrolled on a 1st-yr business studies program of a UK university, this study employs regression analysis to empirically investigate the extent to which this belief is supported by the data. The results suggest that the performance of culturally mixed groups is neither a function of the individual ability of the least able group member, nor of the average ability of the members of the group. Instead, in this context, the group work mark is more likely to reflect the ability of the most able group member. The data also indicate that assessed multicultural group work has, on average, a positive rather than negative effect on the individual average mark of all students, evidence consistent with the synergistic effects expected to emerge in multicultural groups (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02602930220128724,"multicultural group work, individual average mark, international students, college students","*Academic Achievement

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) The purpose of this chapter is to make explicit the influence of culture on the conceptualization and construction of mental illness. The authors first examine the theoretical assumptions and methodological fallacies that underlie the assumed universal patterns of expression of mental distress rather than cultural specificity of idioms of distress. Next, they demonstrate the need for extensive rethinking and restructuring of mental health theory for Asian Americans. They offer a different theoretical perspective for assessing the mental health of Asian American clients, and broadening the monocultural, European American paradigm to promote greater sensitivity in the assessment of cultural variations in emotional distress. It is suggested that researchers and practitioners interpret behavior according to its contextual meaning and accept the equal validity of various cultural constructions of the distress.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the book) This chapter demonstrates that the evidence for gender differences in verbal, mathematical, and visual-spatial ability stems from studies of European American, middle- class samples who have average levels of cognitive functioning. When other ethnic groups are included in such analyses and a wider range of skills is assessed, these differences are challenged and often reversed. Importantly, data on people of color render biological explanations for cognitive gender differences suspicious at best. For example, if (purported) male superiority in mathematics is the product of male biology, Halpern asks, then why are the men in question overwhelmingly Asian rather than Black or Latino? Unless one wishes to suggest that Black and Latino men are less biologically male than Asian men, achievement in mathematics by women or men--seems to be a question of reinforcement and opportunity within specific sociocultural contexts rather than an issue of biology. Halpern reveals how the sociocultural context of middle-class European Americans has produced ostensible cognitive gender differences and highlights the dangers of using monocultural samples who represent the middle range of skills, income, and the like, in gender research.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article explores the moral sources that give multiculturalism the potency to move psychology to reassess itself. The power of the multicultural perspective appears to derive from its ability to show how psychology's tendency toward monocultural universalism has undermined its aims as a science of human behavior and promoter of human welfare. The multicultural critique also draws on Euro-American moral traditions and ideals, such as individual rights, authenticity, respect, and tolerance. In spite of the importance of these ideals, multiculturalists often criticize Euro-American culture without acknowledging their debt to it. Moreover, these particularist moral sources undercut multiculturalism's universalist appeal. There is a paradoxical tendency among some advocates of multiculturalism to encourage cultural separatism and an inarticulateness in dealing with intercultural value conflict. We present some recommendations for dealing with these dilemmas from philosophical hermeneutics, including the contextualization of multiculturalism, an approach to sifting and evaluating cultural values, and an ontological account of the dialogical nature of humans.

Coleman's (1995) hypotheses that the strategies adolescents use to cope with cultural diversity will be organized in a sequential manner and that adolescents will use different strategies depending on the situation. To test these hypotheses, the authors had 398 6-8th graders rate the likelihood of using 6 strategies for coping with cultural diversity: Separation, Assimilation, Acculturation, Alternation, Integration, and Fusion. Results support Coleman's hypotheses. This suggests that the wider the range of strategies an individual has to cope with cultural diversity, the better he/she will be able to effectively manage a culturally diverse or monocultural environment. The authors make suggestions for future research and implications for counseling are suggested. Examples of items from the questionnaire used in this study are appended.

In addition, for half the children each accent was given its appropriate ethnic designation, whereas the remaining children listened to unlabeled accents. The children rated the accents on evaluative (status, solidarity) scales and on traits comprising the stereotype of each group. The findings indicated that their evaluations were influenced by accent ethnicity and accent strength. In addition, the older but not the younger children's evaluations were affected by accent identification and ethnic contact. The data also suggested that the accents evoked ethnic stereotypes. The emerging complexity of the language attitude-stereotype relationship is discussed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Calls for incorporating cultural competence in psychology have been hindered for a number of reasons: belief in the universality of psychological laws and theories, the invisibility of monocultural policies and practices, differences over defining cultural competence, and the lack of a conceptual framework for organizing its multifaceted dimensions. A proposed multidimensional model of cultural competence (MDCC) incorporates three primary dimensions: (a) racial and culture-specific attributes of competence, (b) components of cultural competence, and (c) foci of cultural competence. Based on a 3 (Awareness, Knowledge, and Skills) x 4 (Individual, Professional, Organizational, and Societal) x 5 (African American, Asian American, Latino/Hispanic American, Native American, and European American), factorial combination, the MDCC allows for the systematic identification of cultural competence in a number of different areas. Its uses in education and training, practice, and research are discussed.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Throughout my life, I have been constantly reminded that my racial and cultural heritage are quite different from many in this society. Some of these reminders have been quite pleasant and validating; many, however, serve to invalidate, diminish, and strike at the core of my racial identity. As a person of color, I have been exposed to prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Surviving monoculturalism and racism has helped shape not only my personal identity but my professional one as well. In this chapter, I would like to share with you some of the lessons I have learned about prejudice and discrimination, especially as it relates to growing up culturally different in a predominantly monocultural society.

Arguing that they face racism and cultural ignorance from predominantly white gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender organizations and homophobia from sexist coethnics, a group of Vietnamese lesbians, bisexual women and female-to-male transgenders founded -Mi, ""a social support network that endeavors to support and advocate the rights and visibility of Vietnamese-bisexual women, lesbians and transgender people."" Given the diverse gender and sexual identities of the group as well as their diverse connection to Vietnamese culture (recent arrivals vs. those who have been in the U.S. longer vs. younger generation vs. older generation: Chinese-Vietnamese vs. Hapas vs. 'pure Vietnamese'; variegated Vietnamese English language abilities), how do -Mi members coalesce and construct a collectivity meanwhile validate and support the diverse gendered, sexual and ethnic experiences of one another? Using Michael Burawov's extended case method, I examine -Mi's organizational evolution and dynamics in context of the sexual, racial, ethnic and gender landscape of Southern California. Extracting from the literature on ""identity."" I propose the concept ""identity work"" to examine how identity issues are evoked and negotiated in interaction among -Mi members. My three-year ethnographic findings from participant-observation and individual interviews suggest that -Mi has been relatively successful to include, support and validate its members' multiple marginalized identities. At the same time, pragmatic attempts to coalesce by drawing group boundaries in everyday interactions tend to pattern into a hierarchy that centers and normalizes experiences of bicultural-bilingual Vietnamese lesbians. These processes render the marginalization and invisibility or tokenism of bisexual and transgender people as well as those who are Vietnamese monolingual and to some extent English monolingual-monocultural, and biracial. I discuss how organizational structure (volunteer group), discourse resources, personal struggle, and political struggle orient members and mold their interactions that lead to affirmation and/or marginalization of certain members' experiences. I conclude with what these findings of provisional identity works tell us about how the hierarchies of race, gender, sexuality are challenged or reproduced in everyday interaction and what the future holds for -Mi and similar groups.

The current study extends the initial investigation through the use of a standardized instrument to assess whether the Sphinx club, a school-based Africentric intervention enhances academic achievement in African American middle school boys who are at risk for academic failure or underachievement. This intervention combined the principles of the rites of passage movement within African American communities and current thinking on the process of second culture acquisition to focus on developing the participants' sense of ethnic self as a precursor to academic performance. This investigation adds a Social Skills Intervention (Elliott & Gresham, 1991) for the control group and participants were randomly assigned to their treatment condition. Results from the Classroom Behavior Scale (Bass & Coleman, 1996), Grade Point Average, Academic Self-Efficacy Scale-AV (Coleman, 1996), Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992) Social Skills Rating System (Gresham & Elliott, 1990) and Disciplinary referrals indicated that culturally relevant interventions (Sphinx Club) can be as successful as monocultural interventions (Social Skills intervention). Based on the results of the investigation it appears that social skills development has a stronger relationship to students' attitude toward academic achievement, whereas increasing one's ethnic identity has a stronger relationship to student's actual academic achievement. It also adds to the body of empirical research, which is currently being conducted on culturally relevant interventions.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the introduction) Focuses on crucial problems of race and ethnicity at the level of higher education in South Africa. The authors discuss the roles of institutions of higher education in transforming a post-apartheid South Africa. The major challenge facing higher education is to provide equitable access to its institutions for members of all groups and to integrate diverse ethnic and racial groups into historically segregated, monocultural institutions. The authors suggest that transforming higher education in South Africa is a monumental task. They address problems that constrain the transformation and reform initiatives based on reform reports, including the Education White Paper issued in 1997 by the Department of Education, which presents a national framework for transforming higher education. The authors observe that there are parallels between the current demands in South Africa for integration of higher education and those in the US during the civil rights movement and subsequent 2 decades.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Conquest, land-theft, slavery, and genocide do not fit easily into heroic narratives of national destiny. When these brutalities are not publicly named and mourned, a habit of dissociative thinking is hardened into a cultural complex. The instinct of depth psychology is to approach these matters by climbing up to the peaks of a universalist discourse. This instinct is as much a social as a personal therapy. A public restoration process will require much more mature, self-conscious, and sophisticated individuals for the dialogue of the future among communities. Those who are inexperienced in negotiating multiple cultural codes because they live in monocultural environments will need to learn the arts of mestizaje and conversation in uncomfortable borderlands. Many people will be needed to create together the new decentered environments where all can reclaim desire, meaning, magic, and possibility. If it enters the vale, depth psychology has an important contribution to make in remapping of discontinuous and multiple notions of self and other, consciousness and unconscious, that must be the basis of restorative encounters and acts of love.

Subjects were recruited from San Francisco Bay Area community colleges. Instruments used in this study were the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale (Marin & Gamba, 1996), the Fear of Success Scale (Zuckerman & Allison, 1976) and a sociodemographic questionnaire. The major research question asked: Do Mexican American community college students who are bicultural have lower levels of the motive to avoid success than monocultural students do? The first minor research question asked if there is a relationship between the motive to avoid success and monoculturalism. The second minor research question focused on the motive to avoid success correlating with the demographic questionnaire items, Fear of Success Scale, and Bidimensional Acculturation Scale. Results didn't support a positive response for the major research question, nor for the question of a relationship between the motive to avoid success and monoculturism, In 3 instances evidence supported a positive response for the second minor research question that asked if the motive to avoid success was correlated with items on the demographic questionnaire, and items in the Fear of Success Scale, and the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale. The first statistically significant finding for the second minor research question from an ANOVA suggested that parental college attendance contributes to lower fear of success scores. The second statistically significant finding from an ANOVA suggested an interaction of birthplace and being the first in one's family to attend college, and lower Fear of Success scores. The third finding for the second minor research question derived from an ANOVA suggested higher Grade Point Averages for subjects having a foreign High School Diploma. A 2-way ANOVA for items on all 3 instruments did not highlight any interaction for acculturation, high school graduation, and grade point average. Therefore, the results do not suggest that the differences in grades are related to acculturation.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Comprehensive comparison and conceptual analysis of cross-cultural, cultural, and indigenous psychologies in terms of their aims and theoretical and methodological perspectives lead to the conclusion that the first 2 are special cases of the third. Two basic types of indigenous psychology are distinguished on the basis of conceptual analysis: monocultural indigenous psychologies (including monocultural cultural psychologies) and cross-cultural indigenous psychologies (including both cross-cultural psychology and cross-cultural cultural psychology). Corresponding to these 2 types of indigenous psychology are 2 basic ways to conduct indigenous research, namely, the monocultural indigenous approach and the cross-cultural indigenous approach. Both approaches require achievement of the condition of indigenous compatibility, which stresses the sufficient congruity of the researcher's theory, methods, and results with the studied psychological or behavioral phenomenon and/or sociocultural context. Finally, several ways to integrate research findings obtained by the monocultural and cross-cultural indigenous approaches are delineated and discussed with respect to their function in creating and indigenously derived global psychology.

The respondents in these studies have largely consisted of White-Anglo therapists. This study examines Latino therapists and their perceptions of psychopathology toward Latino gay male clients and its relation to the style of acculturation of (bicultural vs. monocultural identity toward either Latino or Anglo-American culture) of the respondents. The hypothesis states that bicultural Latino therapists win report a lower level of psychopathology than monocultural Latino therapists in Latino gay male clients. Biculturalism, and social construction theory provided a theoretical framework for the study. The study sample consisted of 155 Latino therapists obtained from New York area mental health clinics and the mailing lists of two Latino professional organizations. Case vignettes of a Latino gay and heterosexual client were assessed on a rating scale. A language based acculturation scale determined the style of acculturation of the respondents. Demographic data was also collected. The findings showed no relationship between the acculturation of Latino therapists and their perceptions of psychopathology toward Latino gay male clients.

Two domains of the resilience process were examined: academic resilience which was operationalized by school grades (GPA) and emotional resilience which was operationalized by measures of depression and anxiety. Variables examined for their predictive relationships with resilience were: locus of control, biculturalism, religious affiliation, parental influence, special education attendance, and bilingual education attendance. Acculturative stress was operationalized by scores on the Social, Attitudinal, Familial, and Environmental (SAFE) scale. Two aspects of the acculturation process were examined: (1) acculturation orientation or the degree to which young Haitian immigrants adopted a monocultural or bicultural ethnic identity during the acculturation process, and (2) biculturality or the degree to which they maintained social interactions and contact with one culture to the exclusion of the other (Haitian or American) or both cultures (Haitian and American). Various mechanisms were found to be involved in protective and vulnerability processes. Bicultural acculturation orientation emerged as a strong predictor of academic resilience, and parental influence as a strong predictor of emotional resilience. Acculturative stress and biculturality were found to be operating as vulnerability factors for emotional resilience. However, acculturative stress was a stronger and more consistent predictor of emotional resilience (anxiety) among first generation than among second generation immigrants. Gender differences were also noted. Females were noted to be more vulnerable to emotional distress than males. These findings were discussed in terms of their implications for interventions, recommendations for future research, and theoretical definitions for resilience. It was suggested that more attention be paid to the mental health of bicultural youth.

By sorting the data and comparing and contrasting one child's experiences to those of others as individuals and as an aggregate, nine factors appeared to repeatedly impact the process of acculturation. These essential factors that provide insights into acculturation are (1) the mother's role, (2) language acquisition, (3) clothing, (4) artistic endeavors, (5) educational experiences, (6) a receptive attitude, (7) personality, (8) length of residency, and (9) family value of education. Elements of two of the three original concepts that organized my thinking, interviewing, and observations, that is family and school, played significant to moderate roles in the acculturation process of all four students of the study. The children, according to information gleaned from their parents, teachers, and school records, had met appropriate maturational milestones; therefore, the concept of maturation did not impact in these cases. Specific elements from the familial and educational environments did, however, impact the process. Two factors directly pertaining to the individual children's social and psychological make-up rendered significant consequences in the process. Numerous variables impacted the acculturative process and each child's story was varied and complex. The nine common factors isolated in the study do not appear to influence the process of acculturation with equal weight. Some constitute a more salient role than others. It was concluded that three factors appear to play a minor role in acculturation, four appear moderately important, and two factors, personality and a receptive attitude, display the greatest importance. The study was conducted in a Middle Atlantic state where the author was a school administrator. The dimensions of the process of acculturation should raise consciousness levels regarding the need to dispel stereotypes and to acknowledge differences as means to understanding and accepting diversity. Further study is needed to ascertain the generalizability of the findings to other cross-cultural populations.

Vol.59(6-A), Dec 1998, pp. 2058.",0419-4209,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"This dissertation describes the complexities of the existence of multicultural individuals, those who conceptualize themselves as being authentic members of multiple and interlocking identity communities at the same time (e.g. race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious traditions, geography, etc.). Multicultural people are called upon to make choices which are paradoxical and conflict with the complex ways in which they live and make meaning of the world. Such is due primarily to their various and often contradictory commitments and memberships, and as a result of experiencing oppression by a dominant group. As such, multicultural individuals resist monocultural epistemologies and dualistic dichotomies which suggest a universal or ""right"" or ""wrong"" application for meaning-making. Rather, they seek solutions which recognize and enhance the multiple cultures which they affirm. In order to describe the conception of a multicultural self, this project focuses on the philosophical underpinnings of the African-American self, though it is argued that other oppressed identity/social groups also face the challenge of negotiating multiple worlds at the same time. Through the methodology of philosophical anthropology, the dissertation approaches the topic so as to explore the lived experiences of multicultural people. Thus, the historical evolution of the African-American self is considered, as well as the philosophical mechanisms which strive to reverse experiences which marginalize African-American individuals. The dissertation considers these notions through the lens of pedagogical practice as offered by Lisa Delpit in Other People's Children. By teaching poor children and children of color the dominant discourse of power, it is shown how monocultural practices compromise the development of multicultural children. It is suggested that the development of curriculum and communities be conceptualized in such a way so as to better prepare multicultural students to traverse the terrain of schooling. Likewise, these conceptions create the possibility for developing fresh ways to encourage interlocking dialogues, as exemplified by Patricia Hill-Collins, which fosters both internal and external conversation with self and others. And finally, these points lead toward a conceptualization which encourages a robust, dialogical conception of the self that broadly denies the obstructive framing of identity and thought.

Vol.58(11-B), May 1998, pp. 6246.",0419-4217,,ProQuest Information & Learning; US,Electronic,Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation,"Over the past several decades, there have been numerous attempts by anthropologists and psychologists to integrate cultural and psychological perspectives on human behavior and consciousness. These interdisciplinary endeavors, however, have not directly addressed psychotherapists who treat people from other cultures, nor have their relevant findings been synthesized and adapted for clinicians. As a result, cultural perspectives remain largely external to the theory and practice of psychotherapy. Responding to the clear need to move beyond monocultural psychotherapeutic models, this thesis explores the theoretical and practical requisites of a cultural psychotherapy. It examines the ways in which traditional psychotherapy's universalistic premises, culture-specific values, and western clinical methods limit its utility in the treatment of persons from other cultures. It discusses current culture theory as well as anthropological findings on cross-cultural variation in selfhood, child development, language and emotion which would inform a cultural psychotherapy. Extensive interviews with six nonwestern patients who underwent psychotherapy with American psychotherapists raise a variety of new questions concerning the applicability and efficacy of psychotherapy for nonwestern patients. By providing detailed evidence of specific cultural dimensions and dynamics that emerged in their cross-cultural mental health treatments, they demonstrate the inadequacy of traditional models of psychotherapy, which routinely erase the cultural significations of patients' behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and fantasies. The thesis concludes that therapists must acquire a broader understanding both of the potential cultural inflections of such classical psychotherapeutic concepts as transference, resistance, and therapeutic alliance, and of important cross-cultural variation in such fundamental psychotherapeutic concerns as the construction of the self, language, development, and emotion. The thesis also advocates adapting ethnographic and sociolinguistic methods to implement a cultural psychotherapy, and to improve the psychotherapeutic treatment of people from other cultures by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and clinical social workers.

This either/or approach has impeded researchers from obtaining a full understanding of the multiple worlds in which immigrants live. In the present investigation, 189 Mexican-American adolescents are studied in terms of their relation to both the American and Mexican cultures. Four ""cultural orientation"" groups--bicultural, marginalized, acculturated, and monocultural--were created and examined for their contributions to adolescent academic achievement, alcohol and drug use, and psychological distress. Adolescents in the bicultural group, who reported strong connections to the American culture (Americanization) and the Mexican culture (ethnic identity), proved to be the most successful academically and the most satisfied emotionally. Conversely, students in the marginalized group, who reported minimal connections to either culture, had the poorest school grades and the lowest self-esteem. Youngsters in the acculturated group, who reported high levels of Americanization combined with a weak ethnic identity, were the least engaged in school and showed the highest levels of substance use. However, they indicated that they felt the most competent academically. On the other hand, monocultural students--those with strong ethnic identities and low levels of Americanization--felt very connected to their teachers and school although they lacked confidence in their abilities to perform well academically. This group also reported the least amount of involvement with drugs or alcohol. The current study also demonstrated that the positive aspects of biculturalism include protection from the effects of ethnic discrimination. Surprisingly, for the entire sample, higher levels of discrimination were significantly related to decreased substance use.

It is posited that racioethnicity (Cox & Blake, 1991) is multidimensional with at least three conceptually distinct dimensions. Since there is a need for consistent terminology with respect to these distinct dimensions, the following new terms are offered to differentiate among them: ""physioethnicity"" refers to the physiological dimension of racioethnicity; ""socioethnicity"" refers to the sociocultural dimension; and ""psychoethnicity"" refers to the psychological dimension. Results showed that for the dominant group (Hispanics in this case) (1) bicultural and multicultural individuals were more satisfied with coworkers than acultural and monocultural individuals and (2) individuals with higher strength of psychoethnicity were more satisfied with coworkers, the work itself, and supervision than those with lower strength of psychoethnicity. The findings suggest racioethnic differences within the dominant group and between groups beyond race.

This is a review of the book, ""Catecholamine Function in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Emerging Concepts"" (see record 1994-97404-000). This book, edited and largely contributed to by M. Michele Murburg, is an examination of the state of research into a narrow slice of a somewhat broader slice of the PTSD pie, an examination admittedly limited and incomplete. Various authors describe the basic foundations of stress responses as understood through the neurobiology of the catecholaminergic system and then summarize research into that area. The initial presentation is a section oriented toward an overview of catecholaminergic responses to stress and the neurobiological systems involved. Chapters then focus more precisely on PTSD and such systems. Methodological issues are then presented, which help define the boundary lines of both what has been done and the possible limits on generalizing results thus far gathered. An excellent summary of the book, pointing out still unresolved issues and conflicts among the authors is provided. The book's strength lies in its ability to clearly provide an overview of the research into the functions of catecholaminergic systems in PTSD. What is lacking is, oddly enough, a psychiatric perspective. But perhaps the greatest problem with the book is its monocultural fixation on catecholamines. At best, this book will serve as a historical artifact as to what was being explored among some researchers at this time.

Acculturation is a multidimensional process whereby acculturating individuals may attain a monocultural, bicultural, or multicultural orientation and identity. An acculturating immigrant faces an existential dilemma between a conservation and formation of his/her self-identity. The research highlights the very personal, individual-specific nature of intercultural experience. In contrast most studies of immigrant acculturation use group populations. Method. A review of the existing literature on this subject was conducted. A scholarly examination of a limited number of studies was performed in order to survey overall methodological strengths and limitations in studies exploring this subject. Results. A sizable body of extremely diversified literature was discovered. Problems inherent in studying the population of interest often contributed to specific methodological weaknesses in the studies reviewed. The findings of this review research suggest that the relationship between identification processes and acculturation is unique. The findings indicate that immigrants tend to develop bicultural identities rather than monocultural identities. They develop a more integrated sense of self, maintain a strong affiliation with family and primary cultural group, and an acceptance of life in the United States.

The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of ethnic identity, acculturation and alienation of Latino medical students, in order to assess the strength and direction of the relationships. This study used a structural equation model to test the hypothesized relationships. Burbach's University Alienation Scale, Marin et al.'s Short Acculturation Scale and Phinney's Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure were used in the mailed survey. Additionally, 23 other variables were surveyed: demographic, academic and minority stressors. The target population was Latino medical students attending four state medical schools in Texas. The final number of surveys analyzed were 212. Major Findings include: Latino medical students were found to have a strong ethnic identity and high acculturation status. Even though most tended to be first or second generation Americans, evidence supported a typology that included a monocultural Latino, a bicultural individual and a monocultural Anglo. Results indicated that overall Latino medical students were not alienated. The main predictor variables were found to be not related to the dependent variable. The study did find a significant inverse relationship between the interaction of ethnic identity and acculturation on alienation (p =.02). The results suggest cultural factors do influence sociocultural adjustment. Specifically, the study found that lack of faculty mentors (p =.04), pressures to give up one's cultural heritage (p =.0001), and unfair treatment (p =.005) were significantly related to Latino students' feelings of estrangement. Additionally, a significant inverse relationship was found between acculturation and ethnic identity (p =.0001).

The goal of this project was to examine cultural identity, its definition and measurement from two theoretical perspectives: social identity theory and acculturation research. Based on literature reviews in both fields, seven facets were proposed as defining cultural identity: amount of cultural contact, self-identification, culture-specific behaviors and attitudes, stereotypic self-perceptions, group-evaluation, perceived similarity between cultures, and identity orientation. The groups studied were German and U.S. American monocultural and bicultural individuals. Participants provided information about their socio-cultural backgrounds, their cultural experiences, and rated how characteristic each of 120 trait attributes was (a) of themselves, (b) of their native cultural group, and (c) of their non-native cultural group. They also rated the desirability of the attributes and completed a questionnaire assessing individual identity orientation. Analyses focused on three issues. First, monocultural and bicultural groups were compared to examine how intercultural contact is related to cultural identity. The results suggested a ""reaffirmation effect"" for biculturals: they perceived themselves and others in ways more typical of their native culture than did monoculturals. Individual-difference analyses within the bicultural groups showed that the amount of intercultural contact was unrelated to culture-specific perceptions, but did predict culture-specific behaviors and attitudes. The second set of analyses focused on the definition of cultural identity and the underlying dimensions of individual differences in seven aspects of cultural identity. Factor analyses within the bicultural group suggested three factors interpreted as cultural affinity, stereotypic perceptions, and identity orientation.

Students participated in an hour-long, semistructured, audio-taped interview of 4 sets of open-ended questions. Experiences were analyzed, including the goals of multicultural education, the monocultural dimensions of high school curricula, and the possible impact of a multicultural curriculum and school attitudes. The discussions suggested that curriculum design should reflect contributions and perspectives of various groups to address student alienation and prejudiced, discriminatory behaviors that they encountered, and it should be inclusive of all students. Findings revealed that minority students cared very deeply about their education and validated the goals and practices advocated in multicultural education literature.

In this edited volume, Root presents a new paradigm for the emerging multiracial population in America. The call for deconstruction of existing theory and the creation of new paradigms for understanding and investigating the multicultural experience is a major premise of this book. Existing social, political, and theoretical frameworks--based on monocultural, monoracial, linear models of social relations and social identity--have forced biracial individuals to choose one or the other culture and to deny significant parts of their heritage and existence. These models mirror the dichotomous, forced choice schemes of racial classification. This volume seeks to correct these practices and perceptions by presenting alternative approaches to social identity and racial classification based on the incorporation of simultaneous membership and multiple, fluid identities.

Covering all major areas of the field, the authors demonstrate how much we can learn by applying a cultural perspective to the study of social cognition, social influence, social relations, and interactions between individuals and groups in applied settings. As a result, the book facilitates a richer, more complete comprehension of human social behavior.
(from the preface) A cross-cultural perspective can enrich our understanding of classic and current research in the most important topics in the science of social behavior, including social cognition, social influence, and social relations. Our book is intended to introduce this perspective in social science classes, such as social psychology and organizational behavior, where human social behavior is a focus. We have attempted to write a book that would serve as an engaging supplement to expand the standard ""monocultural"" review of social behavior offered in introductory courses.

It covers exclusively the field of psychotherapy, and not the broader applications of the person-centered approach. . . . Various orientations are heard: Classic Rogerians, client-centered therapists who favor some form of integration or even eclecticism; experiential psychotherapists for whom Gendlin's focusing approach is a precious way of working; client-centered therapists who look at the therapy process in terms of information processing; existentially-oriented therapists. Several chapters contain reflections on the evolution-past, present and future-of client-centered/experiential psychotherapy. . . . In numerous contributions we find efforts to build and further develop a theory of psychopathology, the client's process, the basic attitudes and task-oriented interventions of the therapist. The chapters dealing with clinical practice typically aim at the description of therapy with specific client populations and particularly severely disturbed clients. And finally a few fields are introduced which are new or barely explored within the client-centered/experiential approach: Working with dreams, health psychology, couple and family therapy.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Introduces this special section of American Psychologist. Behind this collection of articles lies a shift in national attention comparable to that inspired by the 1957 appearance of Sputnik, an event that triggered an unprecedented commitment of U.S. national resources to the fields of engineering and foreign language and area studies. Repeated shocks to America's position in the world--as we Americans understand it--over the past five years have raised renewed interest in the unpredictable world beyond our borders. Bills to provide greatly increased funds for language training have passed one or both houses of Congress, the Fulbright programs held their own in the 1981 budget offensive, and the American Psychological Association (APA) was asked to join a multidisciplinary effort to call attention to the need of our students, particularly those whose field of study is human behavior, to learn more about the world. The five articles that follow were commissioned by APA's Board of Directors as part of a ""Project on International Education in the Undergraduate Disciplines"" supported by the National Council on Foreign Language and International Studies (NCFLIS) through a grant from the U.S. Department of Education. A major theme emerges clearly from the articles that appear in this special section. There appears to be general agreement among the authors that U.S. psychology suffers from insularity, perhaps born of the very great size of the ""domestic market"" in psychology in this country, For the sake of the science, however, and to increase its scope of application, the authors urge that U.S. psychologists reach out toward a more truly international science, one fully sensitive to the powerful, multiform variable of culture.

For each S, factor analysis of the judgments concerning the probability of occurrence of specific social behaviors in specific social situations provided information of how the S linked social behaviors. ANOVA on the factor scores provided information about the S's beliefs concerning how attributes of social situations are linked to social behaviors. Inspection of the individual models of social behavior indicated that some common elements across models are probably linked to culture. The technique has wide applicability for social and personality psychology because it permits idiographic comparison of models of social behavior across individuals who share some attribute.

This slim handbook consists of nine chapters organized around two main foci: (a) mental health factors relevant to disaster events and (b) mental health practices applicable to victims of disaster. The volume's broad scope is impressive. Yet while espousing, implicitly, ethnographic methods, it seems to entertain monocultural assumptions. This handbook, unlike the typical handbook in psychology, is handy; primarily designed for the practitioner, it is portable and usable as a field operations manual.

A stochastic analysis of decision making was conducted to illuminate some of the differences between group types in leader communication over time. 32 American and 10 French and Arab undergraduates were divided into 3 intercultural and 3 monocultural groups and administered, prior to and immediately following group interaction, a participant questionnaire that measured their rules governing leadership behavior. Results show that each monocultural group presented an internally consistent set of leadership rules prior to group interaction; however, each intercultural group initially presented internally varied rules. Fewer message types and interact patterns were used in the intercultural than monocultural groups. Intercultural groups also used more evaluative responses and fewer reciprocal communication behaviors.

Peer-Reviewed Status-Unknown",Journal Article,"Investigated 2 hypotheses regarding monocultural bilingual children: that they show relatively more problem behaviors than monoglots and to that extent are maladjusted; and that the degree of maladjustment is related to their 2nd-language attainment. The sample was comprised of 226 6-10 yr. olds, with Kannada or Telugu as their mother-tongue, drawn from the 1st 5 classes of 30 primary Tamil-medium schools of Madras. Relevant information about the Ss was sought from the teachers through an inventory covering school situations and from the parents through another inventory covering home situations. For the 1st hypothesis, a control group of children with Tamil as their mother-tongue, matched for intelligence, was used. The 2nd-language attainment of the sample was judged by measuring 4 language skills. Results support the 1st hypothesis partially, but not the 2nd.
