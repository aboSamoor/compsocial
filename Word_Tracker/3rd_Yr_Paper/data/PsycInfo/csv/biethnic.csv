There remains little research, however, on associations across identity domains, group differences across identity profiles, and the joint association of multiple identity domains with academic outcomes. This dissertation includes two studies that address these limitations in the identity literature. Study 1, examined the ego-social identity profiles that emerged from ethnic identity exploration and commitment, American identity exploration and commitment, and ego identity integration and confusion among an ethnically diverse sample of emerging adults using latent profile analysis (N = 8,717). Results suggested that an eight-profile solution was the best fit for the data. The profiles demonstrated differences in identity status and salience across identity domains. Significant ethnic, sex, nativity, and age differences were identified in ego-social identity membership. Study 2 focused on the ego-social identity profiles that emerged from the same identity domains among biethnic college students of Latino and European American heritage (N = 401) and how these profiles differed as a function of preferred ethnic label. The association of ego-social identity profile with academic achievement and the moderation by university ethnic composition were examined. Results indicated that a two-profile solution was the best fit to the data in which one profile included participants with general identity achievement across identity domains and one profile included individuals who were approaching the identity formation process in each domain. Ego-social identity profile membership did not differ based on preferred ethnic label. Individuals who had a more integrated identity across domains had higher college grades. University ethnic composition did not significantly moderate this association. Taken together, these two studies highlight the intricacies of identity formation that are overlooked when integration across identity domains is not considered.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"A body of literature has increased our understanding of ethnic identity formation among ethnic minorities, but there remains a dearth of research focused on the ethnic identity formation of biethnic adolescents. Biethnic adolescents are likely to have unique experiences related to ethnicity that significantly alter the course of their ethnic identity formation. As such, a conceptual framework of biethnic identity is needed to guide future empirical work on biethnic identity and, ultimately, increase the field's understanding of this critical developmental process among biethnic adolescents. This article provides a review of theoretical and empirical work on ethnic identity among monoethnic adolescents, and, guided by the cultural ecological framework, an ecological framework of biethnic identity development is proposed.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This study estimates the prevalence of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use in a nationally representative sample of monoracial/ethnic and biracial/ethnic youth and young adults. The authors consider 16 racial/ethnic categories and used four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The analysis sample consists of 20,745 individuals in Wave 1. The primary statistical methodology used in the present study is logistic regression with sample weights. Findings suggest that participants who self-report two races/ethnicities have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates. For example, Black-American Indians reported cigarette smoking rates that were significantly lower than rates reported by American Indians but significantly higher than rates reported by Blacks. Groups with the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking at Wave 1 were American Indian, White-American Indian, White, and Multiracial (people reporting three or more races/ethnicities). Groups with the highest prevalence of alcohol drinking at Wave 1 were White-American Indian, Multiracial, Hispanic, White, and White-Hispanic. Groups with the highest prevalence of marijuana smoking at Wave 1 were Black-Asian and American Indian. The authors found an interaction effect between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Lower-class SES status may serve as a risk factor for biracial/ethnic adolescents while upper-class SES may serve as a protective factor for these youth. In general, biracial/ethnic individuals have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Objective: To describe the prevalence and associations of bed- and sofa-sharing in a biethnic UK birth cohort. Methods: We surveyed 3082 participants in the Born in Bradford birth cohort study by using a telephone interview when infants were aged 2 to 4 months. We asked families about sleep surface sharing behaviors, and other sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI)-related behaviors. Results: There were 15.5% of families that had ever bed-shared, 7.2% of families regularly bed-shared, and 9.4% of families had ever sofa-shared with their infants; 1.4% reported both. Regular bed-sharers were more commonly Pakistani (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.96-4.66), had further or higher educational qualifications (aOR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.03-2.57), or breastfed for at least 8 weeks (aOR = 3.06, 95% CI 2.00-4.66). The association between breastfeeding and bed-sharing was greater among white British than Pakistani families. Sofa-sharing occurred in association with smoking (aOR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.14-2.80) and breastfeeding for more than 8 weeks (aOR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.19-2.58), and was less likely in Pakistani families (aOR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.14-0.31), or single-parent families (aOR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.87). Conclusions: The data confirm that bed-sharing and sofa-sharing are distinct practices, which should not be combined in studies of unexpected infant deaths as a single exposure. The determinants of sleep-surface sharing differ between the UK Pakistani and UK majority communities, and from those of US minority communities. Caution is needed in generalizing SUDI/SIDS risk factors across populations with differing risk factor profiles, and care should be taken in adopting SUDI/SIDS reduction guidelines from other contexts.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"This article presents a study which aims to compare the barriers to physical activity reported by persons with diabetes (PwD) and those without diabetes in a large, rural, biethnic population-based sample. Using 5-point Likert scales, seven barriers to physical activity were assessed as the extent to which participants would increase their physical activity if the barrier were absent. Using t tests, chi-square, and ANOVA procedures, it was found that PwD walked less and were less active than those without diabetes even when controlling for age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity. While this study was limited by the relatively small number of PwD in the sample and reliance on self-report measures of behavior and clinical diagnosis, the use of population-based recruitment in a rural, biethnic sample are strengths. Further, the findings provide direction for counseling and messaging around physical activity for PwD. Specifically, diabetes care providers should ask patients about their fear of injury so that these fears can be addressed when providing physical activity recommendations.

Edited Book",Chapter,"(from the chapter) Broome and Anastasiou provide details and insights into the causes and consequences of interethnic conflict in Cyprus by examining both historical and recent events. Attention is given to efforts over the years to bring about peaceful resolution. While results to negotiate a settlement have been not resulted in a successful agreement, encouragement may be found in the ongoing activities of civil-society groups that are actively working to promote contact and build understanding among people from across Cypriot society. Analysis of the conflict's origins begins with a description of the movement by Greek Cypriots in the 1950s against British colonial rule. The authors describe how the biethnic republic created in 1960 quickly fell apart, with events in 1974 leading to a geographic division of the island along ethnic lines. The authors explore the conflicts that led to this division, and while there are many contributing factors, the role of extreme nationalism is given particular emphasis. A summary is provided of efforts by the international community to mediate the conflict, which today is in a protracted stalemate. Exploring the multiple areas through which peace is being promoted, descriptions are provided of interactive problem-solving workshops, conflict resolution training, seminars to promote dialogue, cultural events, and a variety of collaborative projects. The perseverance of the bi-communal groups, which have continued to work towards peace despite many obstacles, provides a sense of hope for the future. Broome and Anastasiou explore the contributions of peace-building activities at the personal, relational, and structural levels. The chapter concludes by discussing implications for ethnic conflicts, including the need to balance international and local input into peace-building, to anchor civil-society initiatives in societal institutions, and to actively develop links between official and unofficial efforts toward peace.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Primarily because of underutilized schools (caused by declining enrollments) and the need to address budgetary deficits brought on by dramatic reductions in average daily attendance, many public school districts, in decades past and the present, have been forced to close numerous schools across the nation. The school boards of these economically troubled districts have resorted to consolidation to help alleviate their financial woes. In highly segregated biethnic or triethnic districts, school boards continue to struggle in deciding which schools to close. The closures of schools with high enrollments of Mexican American or other Latino students who are of low socioeconomic status and who are English language learners are particularly problematic, given their vulnerability for school failure. This article involves a case study of 1 such school proposed for closure, Park Oaks Elementary School in the Conejo Valley Unified School District (Southern California). Via activist scholarship, I relate how my efforts in documenting a goodness of fit at Park Oaks Elementary School proved successful in preventing the school from being closed. A major implication stemming from this study is that educational equality for Latino students and their parents can be achieved without having to resort to litigation. Unfortunately, months after this article was accepted for publication I received some very bad news that the school board reneged on its decision not to close Park Oaks. I explain these events in the Epilogue.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Ethnic differences among first primary intracerebral hemorrhage (PICH) patients in an Israeli biethnic population have not yet been studied. Patients and Methods: We included in the study 546 patients (counting warfarin-related hemorrhages) hospitalized during the period from December 1999 through June 2008. Results: The mean age was 71.1 +/- 14 years for the Jewish patients and 63.3 +/- 13.9 years for the Arab patients (p < 0.0001). Diabetes and smoking were significantly more frequent among the Arab patients. No difference was found between groups by location, extent, or ventricular involvement of PICH. Although the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher among the Jewish patients, adjustment of the model combining multiple risk factors for PICH eliminated this difference. Conclusions: There are differences in the demographic and vascular risk factor profiles between Arab and Jewish PICH patients, with the Arabs found to be younger and to suffer more from diabetes. The location and extent of intracerebral hemorrhage as well as functional outcome were similar between the two groups. The apparent higher in-hospital mortality in the group of Jewish patients was eliminated when the influence of multiple covariates other than ethnicity, main vascular risk factors and international normalized ratio level were taken into consideration.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Inflammatory processes are implicated in a number of diseases for which there are known socioeconomic status (SES) disparities, including heart disease and diabetes. Growing evidence also suggests SES gradients in levels of peripheral blood markers of inflammation. However, we know little about potential gender and racial/ethnic differences in associations between SES and inflammation, despite the fact that the burden of inflammation-related diseases varies by gender and race. The present study examines SES (education and income) gradients in levels of two inflammatory biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in a biethnic (White and Black) sample of men and women (n = 3549, aged 37-55 years) in the USA from the CARDIA Study. Health status, behavioral and psychosocial variables that may underlie SES differences in inflammatory biomarker levels were also examined. Age-adjusted CRP and IL-6 levels were inversely associated with education level in each race/gender group except Black males. Income gradients were also observed in each race/gender group for IL-6 and in White females and males for CRP. In general, differences in CRP and IL-6 levels between low and high SES groups were reduced in magnitude and significance with the addition of health status, behavioral, and psychosocial variables, although the impact of the addition of model covariates varied across race/gender groups and different SES-inflammation models. Overall, findings indicate SES gradients in levels of inflammation burden in middle-aged White and Black males and females.

Edited Book",,"(from the cover) In order to fully understand individuals from diverse cultures and ethnic backgrounds, practitioners need to begin to examine, conceptualize, and treat individuals according to the multiple ways in which they identify themselves. The purpose of this casebook is to bridge the gap between the current practice of therapy with the newest theories and research on working with diverse clientele. Each chapter is written by leading experts in the field of multicultural psychology and includes a case presentation with a detailed analysis of each session, a discussion of their theoretical orientation and how they have modified it to provide more culturally appropriate treatment, and an explanation of how their own dimensions of diversity and worldviews enhance or potentially impede treatment. This text is a significant contribution to the evolving area of multicultural psychology and will be a valuable resource to mental health practitioners working with diverse populations.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Background: Mexican Americans (MAs) have an increased risk of stroke compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), especially at younger ages. Little is known regarding patterns of familial aggregation of stroke and whether familial risk assessment might prove a potentially useful tool in assessing stroke risk in this population. This study's objective was to estimate the sibling recurrence risk ratio (lambdas) for stroke and to compare this ratio between MAs and NHWs. Methods: Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) cases (n = 181) between the ages of 45 and 64 years were identified by a population-based stroke study in a biethnic Texas community. lambdas was calculated overall and by ethnicity. Results: Siblings of ischemic stroke/TIA cases had a doubling in stroke risk compared to what would be expected based on national stroke prevalence estimates (lambdas = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.39-2.61). lambdas was 2.0 (95% CI: 1.39-2.81) among MA stroke/TIA cases and 1.66 (95% CI: 0.82-3.10) among NHW stroke/TIA cases. Conclusion: The sibling recurrence risk for stroke was elevated in MA stroke/TIA cases suggesting that further ischemic stroke genetic studies across ethnicities may be warranted. In addition, a positive family history could prove a useful factor in the clinical setting for identifying MAs at increased stroke risk.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The extent to which the construct of body image is measurement invariant across ethnic groups is an important consideration for studies examining ethnic differences and characteristics that influence body image disturbances. However, the literature examining the body image construct as a function of ethnic group membership is limited. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether Hispanic/biethnic-Hispanic and non-Hispanic White preadolescent girls (aged 8 through 12 years old; N = 141) had fundamentally different conceptualizations of body image in a low to low/middle socioeconomic status school-based sample. Our findings suggest that the measurement construct of body image was similar and relatively stable for Hispanic/biethnic-Hispanic and non-Hispanic White preadolescent girls. In addition, the body image construct was predictably related to disordered eating symptoms in both groups, with different dimensions of body image differentially predictive by ethnic group. Overall, body image appears to be a meaningful construct with similar measurement meanings across Hispanic/biethnic-Hispanic and non-Hispanic White ethnic groups.

Using analysis of variance, four groups (i.e., adolescent males with Latina mothers and European American fathers, adolescent females with Latina mothers and European American fathers, adolescent males with European American mothers and Latino fathers, and adolescent females with European American mothers and Latino fathers) are compared on the above measures. Results indicate that sons of Latina mothers reported the highest levels of familial ethnic socialization. No significant differences emerge between groups on a measure of ethnic identity.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Prior studies on alcohol use and marital functioning have largely overlooked the possibility that these variables operate differently in Latino and European American couples. The present study addresses this gap by examining the role of alcohol-related problems and anger as correlates of marital satisfaction among newlywed monoethnic Latino couples (n = 13), biethnic Latino couples (n = 28), and European American couples (n = 89). Higher self-reported anger by both spouses predicted lower marital satisfaction for all couples. Ethnicity interacted with husbands' alcohol-related problems in predicting husbands' marital satisfaction in monoethnic Latino couples. Ethnicity interacted with husbands' anger in the prediction of wives' marital satisfaction in biethnic Latino couples. Conclusions and implications for treatment and research are discussed.

Cooley's Looking-glass Self Theory was used as our theoretical framework. Cooley argued that in the same way we look into a mirror to discover our appearance, we see ourselves through the eyes of other people. Therefore, other people's reactions largely influence the way we see ourselves. This hypothesis was supported by our focus group data; all respondents regarded themselves as Biethnic only after others pointed it out to them. Our results were in some ways similar to existing Biracial identity models. We, too, found that there were multiple responses to being Biracial. We called them: Unique Me, Model Biethnic, and Just Let Me Be Japanese. Like other researchers, we also found that various factors were influential in shaping Biracial identity. Ethnicity of the non-Japanese parent, family structure, and living environment seemed to have largely shaped our respondents' experiences.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The purpose of this article is to report the process outcomes of a coaching methodology used in a study designed to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity in families. Eighty-eight families with second graders were recruited from a rural, biethnic community in Colorado and randomized to intervention and delayed intervention conditions. This article reports on the 27 families in the delayed intervention group. Families received up to 10 home visits over 10 months from a family advisor and completed activities to improve their dietary and physical activity behaviors. Coaching conversations took place during each home visit. Coaching process outcomes were evaluated by analysis of visit documentation, participant survey, and qualitative interviews. Results indicated that coaching, in conjunction with family activities, engaged families in the process of change and facilitated movement toward the achievement of their weekly nutrition or physical activity goals. Coaching methodology may be particularly useful for participatory research.

Specific aims were to adapt the curriculum; expand it to include physical activity; determine effectiveness on students' attitudes, knowledge, and self-efficacy; and assess teachers' impressions. Three cohorts were established: 173 students taught by a resource teacher, 170 students taught by classroom teachers, and 187 students who did not receive the curriculum. Pre- and posttest surveys measured outcomes, and classroom teachers were observed and interviewed. The curriculum was shown to be effective in enhancing student outcomes for both the resource teacher and classroom teacher cohorts. Teachers reported that lessons needed to be simplified and that children enjoyed them. Findings support the transferability of an urban-based nutrition curriculum to a rural community and the need for students to receive health education annually.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"Menthol smoking may influence the development of tobacco addiction and related health consequences, yet limited data on menthol smoking by youth are available. We assessed usual brand menthol preference by Baltimore-area teenage smokers applying to a smoking cessation study between September 1999 and December 2002. Of a biethnic (Black and White) sample of 593 youths (mean age= 15.5+/-1.4 years, 51% female, 45% African American), the overwhelming majority (93%) were menthol smokers. Menthol preference rates were highest among African American girls and lowest among White boys. Overall, a statistically significant association was found between ethnicity and menthol preference, chi2 (df= 1) = 19.4,p<.001. This association also was observed separately for girls, chi2 (df=1) = 9.21, p = .0024, and for boys, chi2 (df) = 9.59, p = .0020. Menthol smoking did not vary with age in either ethnic group. These findings of overwhelming menthol preference in a treatment-seeking sample of adolescents warrant further research on the developmental trajectory, cessation, and health-related impact of menthol smoking by youth.

The purpose of this study was to expand the knowledge of Latino marital relationships by examining the role of affect in the concurrent and longitudinal marital satisfaction of monoethnic Latino (n = 13), biethnic Latino (n = 28), and European-American (n = 89) newlywed couples. The vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney & Bradbury, 1995) was used to understand the relationship between ethnicity, affect, and marital satisfaction. Couples' problem-solving interactions were videotaped and rated with the Behavioral Affect Rating System (BARS; Johnson, Johns, Kitehara, Ono, & Bradbury, 1998). The BARS affects used were Affection, Humor, Anxiety, Defensiveness, Aggression, Scorn, Frustration, and Hurt. Marital satisfaction was measured by the Marital Adjustment Test (MAT; Locke & Wallace, 1959). Hypotheses based on cultural classifications and Latino cultural scripts were tested using correlations, analyses of variance, and mixed block entry regressions with interaction terms for ethnicity. There were differences in affect ratings based on ethnicity. Monoethnic Latino couples had higher Affection and Hurt, biethnic Latino couples had higher Defensiveness and Aggression, and European American couples had higher Anxiety. Factor analyses demonstrated that Defensiveness, Aggression, Scorn, and Frustration measured a single construct labeled Anger. Significant predictors of husbands' concurrent marital satisfaction were husbands' education, wives' MAT, husbands and wives' Anger, and an interaction of ethnicity with husbands' Affection. Wives' concurrent marital satisfaction was predicted by husbands' MAT and wives' Anger, as well as interactions with husbands' Affection and Humor. Beyond the MAT control variables, husbands' marital satisfaction a year later was explained by interactions of ethnicity with wives' Anxiety and Humor. Wives' longitudinal marital satisfaction was predicted by wives' place of birth, wives' Anger, and interactions of ethnicity with wives' Anger, Anxiety, and Affection. The findings demonstrate that affect is a key component of marital satisfaction for newlywed couples and that there are differences in the role of affect in couples' marital satisfaction based on their ethnicity. Several implications for culturally appropriate marital theory and intervention are discussed.

The purpose of this qualitative study was threefold: (a) to see in what ways the experience of being biracial was associated with the decision to enter therapy and the content of therapy; (b) to understand the relationship between the therapist's race/ethnicity and the biracial individual's experience in therapy; and (c) to explore the relationship between biracial identity and the individual's experiences in therapy. The sample consisted of eight biracial individuals between the ages of 18 to 30, who had participated in therapy within the past 5 years. They each completed a face-to-face, audio-taped interview, lasting between 30 minutes and an hour. The data was analyzed utilizing a collective case study approach, and four themes emerged. The first theme was the variety and importance of both internal and external therapist factors on the therapeutic relationship. The second theme was the nature of the discussion of biracial/biethnic issues in treatment. The importance of feeling understood in treatment was an essential component to positive therapeutic relationships-the third theme. The fourth theme that arose was the influence of family and friends on biracial identity development. An additional issue that emerged was the limitations of current theories of biracial identity development for the participants studied. Implications that arose from this study include the relationship between identity and therapist preference, the importance of discussing race and ethnicity in treatment, and the incorporation of biracial/biethnic issues into psychology training programs.

Participants for this research were acquired through an organization known as the Interracial Family and Social Alliance of North Texas (IFSA) and through convenience sampling. Major findings of this research indicate that parents of biracial and biethnic children believe that it is important that biracial children know all aspects of their dual or multiethnic heritages. These parents emphasize that it is important to keep an honest and open dialogue about race and ethnicity, physical differences, and history. Parents in this study further stress that schools and communities need to address the unique needs of multiethnic families and biracial/biethnic children.

Ethnic identity development may be an especially complex challenge facing biethnic and multiethnic individuals, who are often forced to choose one ethnicity. As children of interracial relationships, biracial and multiracial youth have legitimate claims to multiple ethnic heritages, yet these heritages are often not recognized due to skin color, appearance or name. This study examined the differences in ethnic identity development among adolescents, particularly focusing on multiethnic individuals, exploring the relationships among ethnic identity and self-esteem, ethnic identity and psychological adjustment, and ethnic identity and parental attachment. Two hundred and fifty-one participants completed four pencil and paper measures; the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1990), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), the Achenbach Youth Self-Report (1991) and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Greensburg & Arsmden, 1987). A series of one-way analysis of variance revealed that multiethnic participants scored significantly lower on ethnic identity than both African-Americans and Latinos. As predicted, Multiethnics showed no difference in psychological adjustment and self-esteem, as compared to their monoethnic counterparts. In addition, it was found that the relationship to mother and father was significantly correlated to psychological adjustment, but not to self-esteem. It was revealed in a series of multiple regressions that the relationship to mother, father and ethnic identity achievement accounted for 38% of the variance in psychological adjustment. Lastly, a somewhat limited finding is that having an African-American friend conferred the most significant contribution, predicting 8% of the variance in ethnic identity.

Empirical and theoretical literature concerning this population has been limited and often inconclusive. With continued growth of a multiethnic/multiracial movement issues concerning this population are becoming more salient. The current study investigated ethnic identity, self-esteem, and adjustment among Japanese-African Americans and Japanese-European Americans. The sample consisted of 86 biethnic adults (54 Japanese-European Americans, 32 Japanese-African Americans). Subjects were recruited at local college campuses, through multiethnic organizations, and through snowballing techniques. Subjects completed materials that were mailed to them. The study was correlation with a pre-experimental, cross-sectional design. Heritage Combination (majority/minority, minority/minority) was the primary predictor variable with Gender, Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity comprising additional predictor variables. Instrumentation included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) (Rosenberg, 1965), the Adjective Check List (ACL) (Gough & Heilbrun, 1965), and the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) (Phinney, 1992). Results of the study provided a greater understanding of the heterogeneity within the biethnic community and the need to look further at process as well as outcome. Japanese-African Americans and Japanese-European Americans did not significantly differ in their decisions to identify monoethnically versus biethnically, though monoethnic identifiers were more likely to be male. In terms of ethnic identity as measured by the MEIM, Japanese-African Americans were more likely to assert higher ethnic affirmation and belonging than Japanese-European Americans when education and parental support were sufficient. On remaining aspects of ethnic identity, the predictor variables of Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity accounted for a significant amount of variance in ethnic identity. Relative to self-esteem as measured by the RSE, Heritage Combination was not predictive of self-esteem, though the predictor variables of Current Involvement in Multiethnic/Multiracial/Interracial/Biracial Organization, Ethnically Diverse Community Upbringing, and Perceived Parental Support of Biethnic Identity added significantly to the prediction of self-esteem. In general, irrespective of heritage combination, subjects appeared to have high levels of self-esteem. In terms of adjustment measured by the ACL - PADJ, neither Heritage Combination or any predictor variables contributed significantly to the prediction of adjustment. However, in general, the sample represented a well adjusted group of individuals as evidenced by an ability to effectively manage life's stressors and to maintain a positive outlook.

Data was drawn from the core sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The Add Health public-use data set includes interviews of 6,504 adolescents and 4,600 parents. On the Add Health survey, adolescents were asked multiple questions to assess their racial/ethnic background. Results suggest that biracial/biethnic youth are a particularly vulnerable group in terms of self-reported delinquency, school problems, internalizing symptoms, and self-regard. As a group, they are also more likely to receive some form of psychological intervention. Given these findings and the shortcoming of clinical resources for work with this population, the authors provide a discussion of why biracial youth may be particularly vulnerable from a social constructionist framework and offer several strategies based on narrative family therapy for working with biracial youngsters and their families.

A normal population was studied, and all of the participants were from intact homes where both biological parents were present. This study is important due to the lack of research specifically examining this unique biethnic subgroup. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight adolescent participants along with one or both of their biological parents. Twelve major categories and one minor category emerged from the data analysis based on the constant comparative method described by Maykut and Morehouse (1994). Major categories included: (1) Descriptions of others' perceptions of participants' ethnicity(ies); (2) Ethnic/racial category endorsement; (3) People/experiences impacting (bi)ethnic identity; (4) Positive feelings about biethnicity; (5) Others' questions about participants' ethnic heritage and participants' responses to inquiries; (6) (Bi)ethnic identity as contextual; (7) Perceived benefits of biethnicity; (8) Openness to having dating partners or life partners of any ethnicity; (9) Pressure from oneself or others to identify ethnically with one ethnic group; (10) Desire to become more proficient in the Spanish language; (11) Questioning one's 'Mexicanness'; and (12) Exposure to prejudiced comments against Mexican heritage individuals. The minor category consisted of feelings of social marginalization. The categories highlighted that the biethnic participants have been faced with unique challenges and experiences as adolescents with Mexican and European heritage. The categories were compared and contrasted to the existing literature on biethnicity. These data substantiate major points in the existing literature addressing biethnicity, and also add to it important factors that are potentially relevant for biethnic Mexican American/Euro-American adolescents. The results of this study indicate that the experiences affecting the (bi)ethnic identity of the Mexican American/Euro-American adolescent are complex, interactive, and ever-evolving. This dynamic process is influenced by multiple factors, including numerous personal, familial, and social variables that are interrelated. Clinical implications were also discussed and suggestions for future research were presented.

As of August 1999, 29% of the 73 hopeless Ss had died, compared with 11% of the hopeful. The mortality rates for cardiovascular disease and cancer were significantly greater among the hopeless Ss than among the hopeful. Hopelessness predicted all-cause mortality in a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, ethnic background, current smoking status, number of comorbid medical conditions, self-rated health, and frequency of social contacts. Neither sex nor probable depression was a significant predictor of mortality in this model. Results suggest that hopelessness is a significant predictor of mortality in older and middle-aged adults of various ethnic backgrounds.

A four-factor model (with direct exposure as the exogenous variable) was specified on 239 African American and European American females. In addition, the model was respecified (with witnessed exposure and verbally-mediated exposure as the exogenous variables) on a mixed-gender African American sample of the data. For all types of exposure, the structural models supported mediation effects for dissociation. The data suggest that dissociative experiences and subsequent PTSD-related distress are sequelae of direct exposure, witnessed exposure and verbally-mediated exposure to interpersonal violence. In addition, the data suggest that the relationship between witnessed or verbally-mediated exposure to interpersonal violence, dissociative experiences and PTSD-related distress was more relevant for the African American students than European Americans students in our sample.

The focus was on evaluating an ecological or contextual theory of biracial/biethnic identity. Participants were asked to choose one of three ways in which they would like to participate in the qualitative portion of the study: (a) in-person interviews, (b) E-mail narratives, and (c) written narratives. In addition, all participants were asked to complete the Demographic Measure, the Racial Experiences Questionnaire, and the Physical Resemblance Scale. The grounded theory approach was used to create a theory that was contrasted against an ecological theory of biracial identity development. The qualitative data were analyzed until redundancy was achieved. Several themes emerged from the results, including oppressions, a sociocultural identity theory, the biracial experience, family, the community, and influential relationships.

This multicase study charted students' literary engagement in an urban technology magnet school and a rural Hawaii high school. Analyses of 7 students' journal freewriting, character interpretation dialogue journals, and research papers on the novel's cultural authenticity revealed that students (1) produced more personal and interpretive reactions to the novel than simple descriptions of events and (2) had a strong sense of agency and voice, supported by reader-based teaching.

More similarities than differences were found between European American and Hispanic American families. A hierarchical parenting style was associated with externalizing behaviors for European American and biethnic families but not for Hispanic American families. Marital conflict and disengaged family alliances were associated with child externalizing behavior for all ethnic groups. Ethnicity was not found to moderate the relation between marital conflict and family functioning, and greater levels of marital conflict were associated with disengaged family interactions and also with lax or inconsistent parenting. Implications for understanding cross-ethnic issues in family systems and child adjustment are discussed.

There were two main purposes to the present study. The first was to determine which factors are associated with having a strong Mexican American ethnic identity. Four antecedent factors, perceived physical resemblance to Mexican group members, ethnic composition of neighborhoods while growing up, Mexican cultural exposure and knowledge, and parental attitudes towards Mexican ethnicity, were examined. Strength of individual's Mexican American ethnic identity was assessed as a function of individual's heritage and the four antecedent variables. The second purpose of the study was to gain information about biethnic heritage individuals and to determine how biethnic heritage individuals are similar and/or different from monoethnic heritage individuals. Forty-four monoethnic heritage and thirty-eight biethnic heritage individuals participated in the study. The individuals' ethnic identity was assessed using a modified version of the MEIM (Phinney, 1992). The four predictor factors were assessed using measures created or modified by the researcher. Overall, the results indicated that the two heritage groups differed. The monoethnics had stronger Mexican American ethnic identities, perceived themselves to look more like a typical Mexican group member, had more Mexican cultural knowledge and exposure, and lived in more homogeneous Mexican neighborhoods. Several hypotheses examined the relationship between the predictor factors and strength of ethnic identity, regardless of heritage group. Three of these variables, Mexican cultural knowledge and exposure, perceived neighborhood composition, and parental attitudes, helped predict strength of Mexican American ethnic identity. Perceived physical resemblance to Mexican group members did not show this relationship. The last set of hypotheses looked at the interaction of heritage group with the predictor. These interactions were not supported by the results, except for perceived ethnic composition of neighborhood. These results indicate that these variables are important in helping to predict strength of ethnic identity and seem to support the notion that biethnic and monoethnic heritage individuals differ and could be considered members of distinct groups.

The Youth Risk Behavior Survey was administered to 1,617 high school students in a biethnic community in Southeast Texas; 65% were Mexican-American and 26% were non-Hispanic White. Results show that there were no significant ethnic differences in prevalence of drinking alcohol, illicit drug use, fighting, carrying a weapon, or planning or attempting suicide. After adjustment for age, carrying a weapon and fighting were significantly associated with alcohol and illicit drug use, with few exceptions, among the 4 gender- and ethnic-specific subgroups. However, the relationship between suicide (plans and attempts) and substance use among the 4 subgroups was less consistent and of much lower magnitude than for carrying a weapon and fighting. It is concluded that a systematic and integrated approach to changing the environment and norms of communities is needed to affect change and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with violent behaviors.

After adjustment, Ss with NIDDM rated their PQOL significantly lower than did control Ss. The relationship of diabetes and PQOL did not differ by ethnicity. The number of complications of diabetes was not associated with lower PQOL scores. Findings suggest that control and treatment strategies should reflect an understanding of the impact that diabetes has on social functioning, leisure activities, and physical and mental health.

Results showed that more extensive cocaine use experience was linked with being White, older and less educated, regardless of sex. Higher levels of licit and illicit substance use behavior were reported by those reporting more extensive cocaine experience; however, most cardiovascular disease risk factors such as systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, hypertension, physical activity and anthropometric measurements were not related to lifetime cocaine experience. In this age group, the detrimental cardiovascular effects of cocaine may be limited to acute effects. Further studies are needed to determine whether continued exposure is related to cardiovascular disease risk factors later in life.

The authors conducted a 19-yr longitudinal case study of the biethnic southern Ecuadorian parish of Saraguro, where transculturation from the sharply defined ethnic status of indigena (""Indian"") to that of blanco (White) does not require moving away or deceit, is favored by members of the dominant group (blancos), and is undertaken primarily by individuals located at the lowest socioeconomic levels of indigena society. In spite of the openness of ethnic boundaries, the rate of indigena to blanco transculturation has been low and is now decreasing further. Two mutually reinforcing factors have contributed to low transculturation rates: a resurgence of ethnic consciousness and pride and the recent opening of educational and occupational opportunities for indigenas in Ecuador. The resultant reshaping of ethnocultural boundaries is described.

Peer Reviewed Journal",Journal Article,"The anthropological literature generally depicts Mesoamerican Indian communities as egalitarian. This study reveals and examines the dramaturgical nature of egalitarianism among Indians of Teopisca, a biethnic (Ladino-Mayan) town in southern Mexico. It is shown that although much public behavior in this community complies with the moral prescriptions of an egalitarian ideology, such behavior normally serves instrumental rather than moral ends. Following discussion of this ideology and related categories of deviance and defensive interactional tactics, it is proposed that Indian egalitariansim in Teopisca is itself a collective construction of reality designed to assist in the task of self-esteem maintenance in the face of underprivilege and depreciation within the larger Ladino-dominated community. The broader contribution of this study lies in its demonstration of ways in which culture--qua morality--relates to behavior through the medium of actors' everyday practical social interests and concerns.
