 post-apartheid Dance Studies curriculum in South Africa is attempting 
to offer school learners both an education and training in dance as an 
art form. The outcomes-based syllabi are intended to ensure that 
learners come to respect the diversity of South African society, and 
therefore a range of dance styles and genres are offered in order to 
enhance understanding and appreciation of this diversity. Serious 
questions and problems arise, however, when the intentions need to be 
translated and implemented into the classroom. Both political and 
cultural issues inform the hidden curriculum of the syllabi. In 
addition, the context of schooling in much of the Western Cape, in 
particular, means that many of the learners in schools offering Dance 
Studies are drawn from communities beset by current social and political
 strife. This paper attempts to raise some of the issues involved when 
we ask: Whose dance are we teaching in the classroom? To what end?

 review limitations of the traditional paradigm for cultural research 
and propose an alternative framework, polyculturalism. Polyculturalism 
assumes that individuals’ relationships to cultures are not categorical 
but rather are partial and plural; it also assumes that cultural 
traditions are not independent, sui generis lineages but rather are 
interacting systems. Individuals take influences from multiple cultures 
and thereby become conduits through which cultures can affect each 
other. Past literatures on the influence of multiple cultural identities
 and cultural knowledge legacies can be better understood within a 
polyculturalist rubric. Likewise, the concept elucidates how cultures 
are changed by contact with other cultures, enabling richer 
psychological theories of intercultural influence. Different scientific 
paradigms about culture imply different ideologies and policies; 
polyculturalism’s implied policy of interculturalism provides a valuable
 complement to the traditional policy frames of multiculturalism and 
colorblindness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights

 contribute to the pressing question of what drives individuals’ 
cross-cultural attitudes in our increasingly globalized world, in two 
studies, we examined the relationship between endorsement of 
polyculturalism (belief system focusing on historical and current 
interactions, influences, and connections among different racial/ethnic 
groups) and cross-cultural attitudes. In Study 1, high school and 
college students (N = 134) in the Philippines generally endorsed 
polyculturalism, and greater endorsement of polyculturalism was 
associated with more positive attitudes toward people from other 
countries living in the Philippines. In Study 2, college students, who 
were coming of age in two countries with richly diverse histories 
(Philippines: N = 168, United States: N = 211), generally endorsed 
polyculturalism, and in both countries, greater endorsement of 
polyculturalism was associated with more positive attitudes toward 
people from other countries and toward befriending people migrating from
 other countries. Across studies, polyculturalism explained unique 
variance in attitudes toward people from other countries after 
controlling for participants’ degree of national identification, social 
dominance orientation, and extent of positive feelings toward oneself. 
Implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record

 research on the relationship between ideologies and sexual prejudice 
has not focused on intergroup ideologies such as colorblindness, 
multiculturalism, and polyculturalism. In three studies with racially 
and ethnically diverse college and community samples, endorsement of 
polyculturalism—an ideology focusing on the interactions, influences, 
and connections among racial and ethnic groups—was associated with lower
 sexual prejudice (as measured by affective prejudice toward gay men and
 lesbians, traditional heterosexism, denial of discrimination against 
homosexuals, and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians). 
Polyculturalism’s relationship with lower sexual prejudice was mediated 
by greater openness to criticizing elements of one’s culture that 
marginalize some groups. Polyculturalism accounted for unique variance 
in sexual prejudice even when controlling for colorblindness, 
multiculturalism, social dominance orientation, ethnic identity, 
conservatism, as well as race and gender. Colorblindness and 
multiculturalism were not consistently related to lower sexual 
prejudice. Future work on intergroup ideologies and sexual prejudice is 
discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

 cultural contexts in which sexist beliefs are considered traditional, 
shifts toward gender equality represent an example of cultural change. 
Polyculturalism is defined as the belief that cultures change constantly
 through different racial and ethnic groups’ interactions, influences, 
and exchanges with each other and, therefore, are dynamic and socially 
constructed rather than static. Thus, polyculturalism may involve 
openness to cultural change and, thereby, would be expected to be 
associated with lower sexist attitudes. Four studies (both 
cross-sectional and longitudinal) with undergraduate and community 
samples in the Northeastern United States tested whether endorsement of 
polyculturalism is inversely associated with sexism, above and beyond 
potentially confounding belief systems. Across studies, for both women 
and men, endorsement of polyculturalism was associated with lower sexist
 attitudes for two classes of sexism measures: (a) attitudes toward the 
rights and roles of women and (b) ambivalent sexist attitudes toward 
women. Associations remained significant while controlling for 
potentially confounding variables (colorblindness, conservatism, 
egalitarianism, gender and ethnic identity, gender and race 
essentialism, multiculturalism, right-wing authoritarianism, and social 
dominance orientation). Greater openness to criticizing one’s culture 
mediated polyculturalism’s association with attitudes toward the rights 
and roles of women but not with ambivalent sexist attitudes toward 
women. Studying polyculturalism may provide unique insights into sexism,
 and more work is needed to understand the mechanisms involved.

 have long explored the colorblind and multicultural ideological 
approaches to improving intergroup attitudes and relations. 
Polyculturalism, a newly studied ideological approach, focuses on the 
past and current interactions and connections among different racial and
 ethnic groups. Drawing on cross‐disciplinary work, we critically 
examine the various forms that each of these ideological approaches has 
taken across studies, and their implications for intergroup attitudes 
and relations among racially and ethnically diverse children, 
adolescents, and adults. Although each ideological approach has been 
examined in several ways (often combining different forms of each 
approach), there is sufficient comparative work to draw some 
conclusions. We propose that a combined ideological approach be 
implemented in educational settings that maximizes the strengths and 
positive intergroup consequences of colorblindness, multiculturalism, 
and polyculturalism, while minimizes the weaknesses and negative 
intergroup consequences of each approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

 the present study, we investigated two literature bases by way of a 
community survey across Australia. We investigated four acculturation 
orientations (assimilation, multiculturalism, color‐blind, and 
polyculturalism ideologies) and the motivations to respond without 
prejudice. We examined what predicted support for Harmony Day as well as
 explicit discrimination. Multiculturalism, polyculturalism, and 
internal motivation to respond without prejudice correlated with 
positive attitudes in both scenarios. External motivation to respond 
without prejudice was positively correlated with discrimination. 
Conversely, color‐blind ideology had no effect, and assimilation 
ideology related positively to explicit discrimination and negatively 
with Harmony Day. Using a multiple regression analysis, there was a 
difference in emphasis in different contexts. Our findings provide 
antiprejudice practitioners with material for discussions which can 
promote positive intergroup relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

 on intergroup ideologies (colorblindness, multiculturalism) has 
increased our understanding of intergroup attitudes. This article 
reports empirical tests of the relation between a newly studied 
ideology, polyculturalism (ideology focusing on interactions and 
connections among racial/ethnic groups), and intergroup attitudes. 
Across four studies (with racially/ethnically diverse U.S. 
undergraduates, and Black and White American adults), greater 
endorsement of polyculturalism was related to greater equality beliefs; 
appreciation for and comfort with diversity; willingness for intergroup 
contact; and endorsement of liberal immigration and affirmative action 
policies. Polyculturalism explained unique variance after controlling 
for colorblindness, multiculturalism, assimilation ideology, social 
dominance orientation, and right-wing authoritarianism. Implications and
 future directions of studying polyculturalism are discussed. (PsycINFO

 conflict continues to be a pressing social problem in racially and 
ethnically diverse societies such as Canada, England, the Netherlands, 
South Africa, and the United States (e.g., <a href="#c16">Esses &amp; Gardner, 1996</a>; <a href="#c56">Zárate, 2009</a>; <a href="#c57">Zirkel &amp; Cantor, 2004</a>).
 Abundant research has shown how a greater understanding of intergroup 
attitudes and behaviors can be obtained by studying belief systems such 
as social dominance orientation (SDO; belief in social hierarchy and 
inequality), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA; beliefs in authoritarian 
submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism), 
colorblindness (belief that group memberships like race and ethnicity 
should be ignored), and multiculturalism (belief that racial and ethnic 
differences are important and should be recognized and celebrated; e.g.,
 <a href="#c13">Correll, Park, &amp; Smith, 2008</a>; <a href="#c36">Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, &amp; Malle, 1994</a>; <a href="#c37">Richeson &amp; Nussbaum, 2004</a>; <a href="#c42">Ryan, Casas, &amp; Thompson, 2010</a>; <a href="#c43">Ryan, Hunt, Weible, Peterson, &amp; Casas, 2007</a>; <a href="#c49">Verkuyten, 2005</a>; <a href="#c52">Vorauer, Gagnon, &amp; Sasaki, 2009</a>; <a href="#c54">Wolsko, Park, &amp; Judd, 2006</a>; <a href="#c58">Zirkel, 2008</a>).
 In this article, we report empirical tests of an intergroup belief 
system or ideology that may hold great promise in providing a fuller 
understanding of intergroup attitudes and relations (<a href="#c27">Kelley, 1999</a>; <a href="#c34">Prashad, 2001</a>, <a href="#c35">2003</a>; <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>).
 We examine the relation between endorsement of polyculturalism (that 
focuses attention on past and present interactions and connections among
 different racial and ethnic groups; <a href="#c27">Kelley, 1999</a>; <a href="#c34">Prashad, 2001</a>)
 and established measures relevant to intergroup relations. To determine
 whether polyculturalism makes a unique contribution to the 
understanding of intergroup attitudes, we also measure and control for 
the contributions of other pertinent intergroup ideologies 
(colorblindness and multiculturalism each measured in multiple ways) as 
well as other long-standing intergroup-relevant belief systems (SDO and 
RWA). Studying polyculturalism addresses recent interdisciplinary calls 
to better understand people's dynamic representations of cultures and 
racial and ethnic identities as complex processes in an increasingly 
globalized and diverse world (e.g., <a href="#c3">Banks, 2004</a>; <a href="#c11">Chiu &amp; Hong, 2006</a>, <a href="#c12">2007</a>; <a href="#c24">Hong, Morris, Chiu, &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2000</a>; <a href="#c27">Kelley, 1999</a>; <a href="#c60">Mahalingam, 2006</a>, <a href="#c28">2008</a>; <a href="#c34">Prashad, 2001</a>; <a href="#c55">Zárate &amp; Shaw, 2010</a>; <a href="#c58">Zirkel, 2008</a>).</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0EHCAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_10" title="Intergroup Ideologies">Intergroup Ideologies</a></span><br xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As
 background, we first provide a brief review of past work on 
colorblindness and multiculturalism, the two intergroup ideologies that 
have been well-studied and to which polyculturalism has been compared 
(e.g., <a href="#c34">Prashad, 2001</a>; <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>).
 Then we elaborate on polyculturalism and give an overview of the four 
studies aimed at testing the links that polyculturalism has with 
intergroup attitudes.</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0EDHCAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Colorblindness</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">People
 who endorse the colorblind ideology essentially believe that group 
categories (e.g., race) should be de-emphasized, which presumably 
fosters reduced prejudice because groups and group memberships are 
therefore not highlighted in getting to know or judging others (<a href="#c43">Ryan et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c53">Wolsko, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2000</a>). Colorblind ideology can take different forms (for a review, see <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>).
 For one, people can focus on the similarities across groups of people 
(“we are all members of X nationality”); indeed, focusing on people's 
common ingroup identity (“we”), which transcends intergroup distinctions
 (“us” vs. “them”), can improve intergroup attitudes (see <a href="#c20">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000</a>).
 A focus on cross-group “similarities” could be taken to an 
extreme—often referred to as the assimilation ideology, which is 
captured by the “melting pot” notion (e.g., see <a href="#c1">Allport, 1954</a>; <a href="#c55">Zárate &amp; Shaw, 2010</a>) that people from diverse backgrounds should adopt the same ways of the mainstream, dominant culture (see <a href="#c30">Neville et al., 2000</a>).
 While there is debate over whether assimilation ideology is a form of 
colorblindness or a distinct ideology (see support for distinction in <a href="#c41">Ryan et al., 2010</a>),
 both the similarities form of colorblindness and assimilation ideology 
have been criticized for being less suited to or desirable for members 
of marginalized groups. Downplaying group distinctions in a society 
still wrought with racism can lead one not to notice or care about 
persistent racism and lead to the marginalization of nondominant 
cultures (<a href="#c30">Neville et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#c31">Nieto, 1996</a>; <a href="#c34">Prashad, 2001</a>; <a href="#c44">Schofield, 1986</a>; <a href="#c58">Zirkel, 2008</a>).
 Furthermore, assimilation in particular is not necessarily successful 
or desirable for members of nondominant groups, particularly those who 
have strong ethnic identities (e.g., <a href="#c21">Garcia &amp; Hurtado, 1995</a>; <a href="#c22">Gonzales &amp; Cauce, 1995</a>; <a href="#c48">Van Oudenhoven, Prins, &amp; Buunk, 1998</a>; <a href="#c55">Zárate &amp; Shaw, 2010</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In
 addition, people can be colorblind by focusing their attention on 
individual differences (e.g., “each person is unique”), as captured by 
the popular saying: “You can't judge a book by its cover” (see <a href="#c43">Ryan et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c44">Schofield, 1986</a>). Focusing on people's individual differences has been related to reduced prejudice (e.g., <a href="#c7">Brewer &amp; Miller, 1984</a>).
 Nonetheless, this “uniqueness” form of colorblindness has been 
criticized as being too cognitively taxing for people to realistically 
use in their day-to-day lives (e.g., <a href="#c17">Fiske, Lin, &amp; Neuberg, 1999</a>; <a href="#c20">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000</a>).
 All forms of colorblindness have been criticized for directing 
attention away from the valued identity of members of marginalized 
racial and ethnic groups and for working against people's needs for 
affiliation (e.g., see <a href="#c4">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</a>) and to divide their world into distinct social categories (e.g., <a href="#c47">Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Richer, &amp; Wetherell, 1987</a>; also see <a href="#c8">Brewer, 1991</a>).</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0ECHCAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Multiculturalism</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In
 contrast to the colorblind ideology, people who endorse the 
multicultural ideology think it is important to pay attention to and be 
knowledgeable about people's group memberships such as their race and 
ethnicity; presumably prejudice is reduced for people who hold this 
ideology and have developed sufficient knowledge about and understanding
 of other groups' rich histories and current customs (<a href="#c3">Banks, 2004</a>; <a href="#c46">Sleeter, 1991</a>; <a href="#c58">Zirkel, 2008</a>). Like colorblindness, multiculturalism has taken different forms (for a review, see <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>).
 In a popular version of the multicultural ideology, people focus their 
attention on learning about different racial and ethnic groups, 
including their customs and traditions, as a way to obtain a better 
understanding of the lives, experiences, and perspectives of diverse 
others (e.g., <a href="#c43">Ryan et al., 2007</a>, <a href="#c41">2010</a>; <a href="#c53">Wolsko et al., 2000</a>, <a href="#c54">2006</a>).
 Endorsement of multiculturalism may also take the form of learning to 
appreciate and value different groups' positive contributions to a 
diverse society (“appreciate contributions” form; e.g., <a href="#c43">Ryan et al., 2007</a>, <a href="#c42">2010</a>; <a href="#c53">Wolsko et al., 2000</a>, <a href="#c54">2006</a>).
 Additionally, people who endorse multiculturalism may focus their 
attention on groups maintaining their own cultures and traditions, such 
as for immigrants in a new country or society, or for nondominant groups
 in relation to the dominant culture (“maintain cultures” form; e.g., <a href="#c5">Berry &amp; Kalin, 1995</a>), which is in opposition to the assimilation ideology (e.g., <a href="#c55">Zárate &amp; Shaw, 2010</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Yet,
 noting concerns with all three forms of multiculturalism, critics 
suggest that if people emphasize the distinctness of racial/ethnic 
groups within a diverse society, even if casting those differences in a 
positive light, they are focusing on how cultures are separate, bounded,
 and unchanging entities, which is an inaccurate portrayal and can 
inadvertently increase their stereotyping and discrimination (e.g., <a href="#c6">Bigler, 1999</a>; <a href="#c34">Prashad, 2001</a>).
 Critics have also argued that endorsement of multiculturalism 
(especially in its “important differences” form, but possibly also in 
other forms) can support nationalism and racism by promoting the use of 
cultural explanations to legitimize beliefs about the differences 
between racial and ethnic groups, as a replacement for the biological 
explanations that were used in the past and have been scientifically 
invalidated (e.g., <a href="#c35">Prashad, 2003</a>).</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0EBHCAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Colorblindness versus Multiculturalism</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Studies that have directly compared colorblindness and multiculturalism have produced somewhat mixed results (for a review, see <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>).
 Multiculturalism has generally been related to more positive intergroup
 attitudes than colorblindness, although both ideologies, consistent 
with criticisms, are associated with some negative intergroup attitudes.
 As examples, multiculturalism has been related to lower ingroup bias 
and ethnocentrism (e.g., <a href="#c37">Richeson &amp; Nussbaum, 2004</a>; <a href="#c49">Verkuyten, 2005</a>; <a href="#c52">Vorauer et al., 2009</a>),
 greater willingness for intergroup contact and prodiversity views 
regarding affirmative action and immigration policies (e.g., <a href="#c54">Wolsko et al., 2006</a>), and improved self-esteem for members of marginalized groups (e.g., <a href="#c51">Verkuyten, 2009</a>), but also more stereotyping (e.g., <a href="#c43">Ryan et al., 2007</a>, <a href="#c41">2010</a>; <a href="#c53">Wolsko et al., 2000</a>). Colorblindness has been related to lower ingroup bias and ethnocentrism in some samples (e.g., <a href="#c13">Correll et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#c53">Wolsko et al., 2000</a>),
 but also greater ethnocentrism and stereotyping compared with 
multiculturalism, in other samples, or with implicit measures (e.g., <a href="#c13">Correll et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#c37">Richeson &amp; Nussbaum, 2004</a>; <a href="#c43">Ryan et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c52">Vorauer et al., 2009</a>).
 Additionally, some of the associations these ideologies have with 
intergroup attitudes vary by respondents' race/ethnicity or social group
 status, or by the social context or circumstances (e.g., <a href="#c13">Correll et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#c29">Morrison, Plaut, &amp; Ybarra, 2010</a>; <a href="#c33">Plaut, Thomas, &amp; Goren, 2009</a>; <a href="#c43">Ryan et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c49">Verkuyten, 2005</a>, <a href="#c51">2009</a>; <a href="#c52">Vorauer et al., 2009</a>; see also <a href="#c55">Zárate &amp; Shaw, 2010</a>).</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0EAHCAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Polyculturalism</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given
 the aforementioned theoretical concerns and mixed findings, scholars 
have called for shifts in the study of intergroup ideologies (e.g., <a href="#c3">Banks, 2004</a>; <a href="#c41">Ryan et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#c55">Zárate &amp; Shaw, 2010</a>; <a href="#c58">Zirkel, 2008</a>).
 We suggest that a particularly promising ideology relevant to racial 
and ethnic relations is polyculturalism, which was first described by 
historians <a href="#c27">Kelley (1999)</a> and <a href="#c34">Prashad (2001</a>, <a href="#c35">2003</a>).
 People who endorse polyculturalism focus their attention on how 
cultures have interacted, influenced, and shared ideas and practices 
with each other throughout history, and how they continue to do so 
today. Thus, individuals who endorse polyculturalism view people of all 
racial and ethnic groups as deeply connected to one another through 
their past and current interactions and mutual influences on each 
other's cultures (<a href="#c27">Kelley, 1999</a>; <a href="#c35">Prashad, 2003</a>).
 Moreover, individuals who endorse polyculturalism do not view cultures 
as static, unchanging entities that belong to only one group or divide 
up different groups of people. Accordingly, polyculturalism may foster 
more positive intergroup attitudes by making people feel more connected 
to members of different groups, similar to the goals of other related, 
but distinct lines of significant work on intergroup contact and mutual 
interdependence models (e.g., Common Ingroup Model: <a href="#c20">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000</a>; Mutual Intergroup Differentiation Model: <a href="#c23">Hewstone &amp; Brown, 1986</a>; also see, <a href="#c9">Brown, Vivian, &amp; Hewstone, 1999</a>; <a href="#c10">Brown &amp; Wade, 1987</a>; <a href="#c14">Deschamps &amp; Brown, 1983</a>; <a href="#c25">Hornsey &amp; Hogg, 2000</a>).
 However, polyculturalism is distinct from these models because 
individuals who endorse polyculturalism are focused on the ways that the
 cultures of all racial and ethnic groups around the world have always 
been and continue to be influenced by each other and are not, by 
definition or by extension, focused on developing a superordinate 
identity or common goals with other groups. In addition, endorsing 
polyculturalism does not mean that one needs to have had or seek out 
intergroup contact; instead the polycultural ideology focuses people's 
attention on the outcomes and products of past and current contact 
between racial and ethnic groups and cultures. Nonetheless, 
polyculturalism likely fosters increased interest and comfort with 
intergroup contact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Endorsement
 of polyculturalism, like endorsement of multiculturalism, involves 
recognizing people's racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, rather than
 focusing on differences or distinctions between groups, people who 
endorse polyculturalism focus on the many connections among groups. 
These “interconnections” are not the same as the cross-group 
similarities that can be the focus of the colorblind ideology (e.g., all
 being American). Instead, endorsement of polyculturalism focuses 
people's attention on connections among racial/ethnic groups through 
their shared past and current interactions and exchanges that have 
actually greatly influenced different cultures, such as with ideas, 
customs, or behaviors. <a href="#c27">Kelley (1999)</a> conveys the 
polycultural ideology in the following quote: “All of us, and I mean ALL
 of us, are the inheritors of European, African, Native American, and 
even Asian pasts, even if we can't exactly trace our blood lines to all 
of these continents” (p. 81). Others endorsing a polycultural ideology 
might point out as examples that salsa music and dance derive from the 
influences of African, European, and Indigenous American cultures, that 
African and Asian (among other) cultures mutually influenced Kung Fu 
(see <a href="#c34">Prashad, 2001</a>), and that the combined Zulu and 
Indian influences on health and medical practices are readily apparent 
in contemporary South Africa (see <a href="#c18">Flint, 2006</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Taken
 together, polyculturalism should be related to greater appreciation for
 and more positive attitudes toward all racial and ethnic groups. Yet, 
the relationship that polyculturalism has with racial and ethnic 
attitudes has yet to be empirically tested, which was the main goal of 
the current studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We
 hypothesized that endorsement of polyculturalism would relate to a wide
 variety of markers of positive intergroup attitudes. Because people who
 endorse polyculturalism focus on the mutual influences and interactions
 (historical and current) among different racial and ethnic groups, they
 should view groups on a more level playing field with each other, 
thereby opposing social hierarchies or inequality (e.g., lower social 
dominance beliefs; <a href="#c36">Pratto et al., 1994</a>) and be more 
supportive of social policies that undermine the social hierarchy and 
promote greater equality, such as naturalizing all immigrants in the 
United States and increasing representation and diversity in educational
 and work settings (affirmative action). Moreover, the focus of 
polyculturalism on these mutual influences and interactions among all 
groups (including their ingroups), likely results in seeing greater 
connections between themselves and other groups such that they are more 
comfortable with people of many backgrounds (e.g., greater comfort with 
differences; <a href="#c19">Fuertes, Miville, Mohr, Sedlacek, &amp; Gretchen, 2000</a>).
 Furthermore, because people who endorse polyculturalism more give 
greater recognition to the contributions of all groups to all other 
groups (including ingroups) and society at large, greater endorsement of
 polyculturalism should foster greater interest in getting to know 
people from and learning about other racial and ethnic groups' cultures 
(e.g., greater interest in diversity and greater appreciation for 
differences; <a href="#c19">Fuertes et al., 2000</a>; greater desired intergroup contact; <a href="#c15">Esses &amp; Dovidio, 2002</a>).</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0EGCAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_31" title="Overview of the Current Investigation">Overview of the Current Investigation</a></span><br xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In
 the present investigation, we studied polyculturalism among 
undergraduate and adult community participants from diverse racial and 
ethnic backgrounds because studying a wide range of racial and ethnic 
groups is needed to uncover whether ideologies operate the same or 
differently for different racial and ethnic groups (e.g., <a href="#c45">Shelton, 2000</a>; <a href="#c55">Zárate &amp; Shaw, 2010</a>; <a href="#c56">Zárate, 2009</a>).
 In four studies, we tested the relation between endorsement of 
polyculturalism and the aforementioned established indicators of 
intergroup attitudes, including support for social inequality, interest 
in, appreciation for, and comfort with diversity, willingness for 
intergroup contact, and attitudes toward immigration and affirmative 
action policies. Because polyculturalism is a newly empirically studied 
ideology, another important goal of the present investigation was to 
test whether polyculturalism has unique associations with intergroup 
attitudes while controlling for relevant and well-established predictors
 of those same attitudes. Accordingly, across studies we also assessed 
the two ideologies discussed as most pertinent to 
polyculturalism–multiculturalism, colorblindness (including multiple 
measures of these two ideologies, as well as the assimilation ideology 
that is often discussed in the intergroup ideology literature), and two 
well-established predictors of individual differences in intergroup 
attitudes—RWA and SDO.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Across
 studies, we used factor analyses to test the hypothesis that 
polyculturalism is a distinct ideology from the other intergroup 
ideologies. We used regression analyses to test the hypothesis that 
polyculturalism has unique associations with intergroup attitudes while 
taking into account the contributions of other intergroup ideologies and
 predictors of intergroup attitudes. In addition, we used multivariate 
analyses of variance (all studies), tests of interactions (Studies 2 and
 3), and separate regression analyses (Study 1) to test the hypothesis 
that polyculturalism can be relevant to all groups such that there are 
not racial/ethnic differences in endorsement of polyculturalism nor the 
relationships that polyculturalism has with intergroup attitudes.</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0EFCAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_36" title="Study 1">Study 1</a></span><br xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In
 Study 1, we examined the relationships between polyculturalism and 
established intergroup measures among a large sample of racially and 
ethnically diverse undergraduates. Our measure of polyculturalism was 
developed beforehand through a series of pilot studies with racially and
 ethnically diverse undergraduate students. The polyculturalism scale 
was designed to measure a neutral form of polyculturalism, focusing 
generally on intergroup interactions, influences, and connections with 
no mention of positive or negative interactions between groups, to make 
it free of confounding valence issues (see <a href="#A">Appendix</a> for
 all items). We also set out to compare polyculturalism to 
multiculturalism and colorblindness, and thus developed and 
simultaneously piloted measures of these ideologies, which were also 
designed to be free of confounding valence issues. Our multiculturalism 
measure focuses on the popular form of recognizing important differences
 between racial and ethnic groups, and our colorblindness measure 
focuses on the two most popular forms, combining a focus on the unique 
individuality of people and commonalities across groups of people (<a href="#c39">Rosenthal, Levy, &amp; Moss, 2011</a>).

(see <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>). In short, polyculturalism was 
significantly related to all outcomes (i.e., lower SDO, greater interest
 in, appreciation for, and comfort with diversity, and greater 
willingness for intergroup contact) even when controlling for 
multiculturalism and colorblindness, indicating a unique and consistent 
association with more positive intergroup attitudes. Consistent with 
past work showing that multiculturalism has positive intergroup 
associations, multiculturalism was significantly related to lower SDO, 
greater interest in diversity, and greater comfort with differences in 
Step 1 of those regressions, but these relationships became 
nonsignificant in Step 2 when polyculturalism was also included. 
Multiculturalism was significantly associated with greater appreciation 
for diversity in both steps, and was not associated with willingness to 
have intergroup contact in Step 1 but became significantly associated 
with less willingness for intergroup contact in Step 2. In addition, 
consistent with past work showing the associations that colorblindness 
has with some positive intergroup outcomes, colorblindness was 
significantly related to lower SDO in both steps.<br><br><a id="tbl3"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="polyculturalism_files/cdp-18-1-1-tbl3a.gif" alt="cdp-18-1-1-tbl3a.gif" title="Regression Analyses for Study 1 (N = 694 For SDO, and All Subscales of MGUDS, But 249 for Willingness for Intergroup Contact)"><em>Regression Analyses for Study 1 (N = 694 For SDO, and All Subscales of MGUDS, But 249 for Willingness for Intergroup Contact)</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although

SDO and RWA (only RWA with SDO as the outcome) in Step 1 along with

 noted earlier, endorsement of multiculturalism or colorblindness can 
take different forms, and thus these ideologies have been defined and 
operationalized in various ways throughout their long-standing 
investigation (for a review, see <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>).
 In our work, we designed measures of these ideologies to be free of 
valence issues and to fit with what we thought were promising aspects of
 multiculturalism (recognizing important differences between racial and 
ethnic groups) and colorblindness (focusing on individuals' uniqueness 
and cross-group commonalities) in the literature. After Studies 1 
through 3 were already underway, two groups of researchers published 
novel studies with measures that captured various forms of 
colorblindness and multiculturalism from the literature, which were

 associations that polyculturalism has with intergroup attitudes would 
still stand while statistically controlling for these other

 We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (principal components 
extraction) with all of the included measures of all four ideologies 
(polyculturalism, multiculturalism, colorblindness, assimilation) to 
test whether polyculturalism is a distinct ideology from the other 
ideologies. A secondary goal of the factor analysis was to examine 
whether the different measures that are intended to measure a single 
ideology (e.g., for multiculturalism and assimilation) seem to 
constitute a single construct representing that one ideology and thus 
could be combined in subsequent planned regression analyses. Examination
 of eigenvalues and a scree plot suggested extraction of four expected 
factors representing each of the four ideologies. The four unrotated 
factors accounted for 50% of the variance. The eigenvalues for these 
four factors in order were 9.48, 4.04, 2.39, and 2.13, and the

 of the items from our polyculturalism scale. The fourth factor had high
 loadings on all of the items from <a href="#c42">Ryan et al.'s (2010)</a>
 colorblindness scale. This factor analysis, combined with the factor 
analyses from Studies 1 through 3, confirmed that polyculturalism is 
indeed a distinct factor from measures of multiculturalism, 
colorblindness, and assimilation tested across these studies. It also 
suggests that multiple measures of the same ideology do constitute the 
same factor and therefore could be combined for later analyses (see 
regression analyses section). As well, these findings suggest that 
consistent with past findings, assimilation is a distinct ideology from 
colorblindness (<a href="#c41">Ryan et al., 2010</a>).<br><br><a id="tbl6"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="polyculturalism_files/cdp-18-1-1-tbl6a.gif" alt="cdp-18-1-1-tbl6a.gif" title="Bivariate Correlations, Means, and SDs of Study Variables for Study 4 (N = 500)"><em>Bivariate Correlations, Means, and SDs of Study Variables for Study 4 (N = 500)</em></span><br><br><a id="tbl7"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="polyculturalism_files/cdp-18-1-1-tbl7a.gif" alt="cdp-18-1-1-tbl7a.gif" title="Bivariate Correlations, Means, and SDs of Study Variables for Study 4 for Asian (N = 187), Black (N = 31), Latino (N = 34), and White (N = 217) Americans"><em>Bivariate

 to Studies 1, 2, and 3, we sought to test polyculturalism's unique 
associations with intergroup attitudes while controlling for other 
intergroup ideologies, but in this study, we compared polyculturalism to
 other established measures of intergroup ideologies, which were 
developed after the first three studies were already underway. Based on 
the results of the factor analysis, to simplify the regression analyses,
 we created composite measures of multiculturalism (a mean of the items 
from all three measures of multiculturalism included) and assimilation 
(a mean of the items from both measures of assimilation included). These
 composite measures demonstrated good internal reliability (αs = .91 for
 multiculturalism and .85 for assimilation). We conducted a series of 
regression analyses in which <a href="#c41">Ryan et al.'s (2010)</a> 
measure of colorblindness and the composite scales of multiculturalism 
and assimilation were entered into Step 1 of the regressions; our 
measure of polyculturalism was entered in Step 2, with SDO, the three 
subscales of MGUDS, and the measure of evaluative bias as the five 
outcomes (see <a href="#tbl9">Table 9</a>). In line with findings from 
Studies 1 through 3, polyculturalism was significantly associated with 
lower SDO, greater appreciation for and comfort with diversity and 
differences, as well as lower evaluative bias, even while controlling 
for the other three ideologies, although the relationship with greater 
interest in diversity became nonsignificant. Replicating past work 
demonstrating some positive intergroup implications of multiculturalism,
 the composite scale of multiculturalism was significantly associated 
with lower SDO, and greater interest in and appreciation for diversity. 
Consistent with results from Study 1 and some positive intergroup 
implications of colorblindness, <a href="#c42">Ryan et al.'s (2010)</a> 
measure of colorblindness was significantly associated with lower SDO, 
greater comfort with differences, and lower evaluative bias. Consistent 
with past work demonstrating negative implications of assimilation 
ideology, the composite assimilation measure was significantly 
associated with greater SDO, less interest in and comfort with 
diversity, and greater evaluative bias.<br><br><a id="tbl9"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="polyculturalism_files/cdp-18-1-1-tbl9a.gif" alt="cdp-18-1-1-tbl9a.gif" title="Regression Analyses for Study 4 (N = 500)"><em>Regression Analyses for Study 4 (N = 500)</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As
 in previous studies, regression analyses controlling for the influence

 four studies with different racial/ethnic groups, both college and 
community samples, and a variety of established indicators of intergroup
 attitudes, greater endorsement of polyculturalism was consistently 
associated with more positive intergroup attitudes. Moreover, 
polyculturalism accounted for a unique amount of variance in these 
intergroup variables, even after controlling for the contributions of 
other relevant ideologies (colorblind, multicultural, and assimilation 
ideologies, each measured in multiple ways), and long-standing 
intergroup-relevant variables (SDO and RWA). Factor analyses in each 
study also support that polyculturalism is a distinct ideology from 
multicultural, colorblind, and assimilation ideologies. Taken together, 
consistent findings across studies suggest that polyculturalism is a 
unique belief with potentially far-reaching implications for general 
beliefs about social inequality and diversity, willingness to have 
contact with diverse groups members, and social policies across diverse 
individuals.</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0EABCAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall,
 findings suggest that endorsement of polyculturalism is associated with
 positive intergroup attitudes for both dominant and marginalized 
groups. However, in Studies 2 and 3 with the adult community samples, 
polyculturalism had a nonsignificant relationship with interest in 
diversity for Black Americans, while having a significant positive 
relationship for White Americans. It seems possible that for particular 
intergroup attitudes, particularly feelings toward diversity, 
polyculturalism may be more relevant or important for White Americans, 
while it does not matter as much to these attitudes for Black Americans.
 To increase our understanding of polyculturalism and its 
generalizability, future work should continue to study the relationship 
that polyculturalism has with intergroup attitudes across diverse 
samples in different parts of the United States and the world.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The
 current studies were all correlational, limiting causal conclusions. In
 this study, we were able to control for the confounding role of several
 variables, including SDO and RWA, and in other work (<a href="#c39">Rosenthal et al., 2011</a>),
 the relationship that polyculturalism has with other forms of prejudice
 has been examined while controlling for SDO, conservatism, and ethnic 
identity. Future work should continue to control for confounding 
variables in examining the relationship between polyculturalism and 
intergroup attitudes, as well as experimentally test for the direction 
of effects. Experimental work will also be essential to understanding if
 and how polyculturalism can potentially be used to improve intergroup 
attitudes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While
 findings in this article consistently supported that polyculturalism is
 related to positive intergroup attitudes, polyculturalism could also 
have unintended negative consequences. For example, it is possible that 
if someone greatly values and takes pride in an element of their culture
 that they associate with only their ingroup, the focus of 
polyculturalism on the influences that other groups may have had on such
 a product could make that person people feel defensive or angry. In 
this vein, future work should explore issues of ethnic identification in
 relation to polyculturalism and the other ideologies (e.g., see <a href="#c29">Morrison et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#c41">Ryan et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#c51">Verkuyten, 2009</a>; <a href="#c55">Zárate &amp; Shaw, 2010</a>). As already mentioned, in some other work (<a href="#c38">Rosenthal, Levy, &amp; Militano, under review</a>; <a href="#c39">Rosenthal et al., 2011</a>),
 the relationships that polyculturalism has with intergroup attitudes 
have been tested while controlling for ethnic identification, and this 
work has found polyculturalism to be unrelated to ethnic identification.
 At the same time, some findings suggest that ethnic identification 
could be a moderator of some of the relationships that polyculturalism 
has with intergroup attitudes (<a href="#c38">Rosenthal et al., under review</a>; <a href="#c39">Rosenthal et al., 2011</a>),
 suggesting this is an important variable to continue to study in future
 work on polyculturalism with diverse participants. As well, the 
interactions that different groups have had throughout history have not 
always been positive, and a focus on such negative interactions (e.g., 
slavery, colonization) may result in intergroup hostility and 
resentment. It is also possible that endorsement of polyculturalism 
could have negative consequences for intergroup relations if people are 
thinking about the possibility of all cultures becoming too similar to 
each other or indistinguishable because of widespread mutual influence, 
which may be a contemporary concern with increased globalization. These 
and other possible weaknesses or pitfalls of polyculturalism require 
attention (for a review, see <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>).
 Still, to date, findings across these and other studies have not found 
polyculturalism to be associated with any negative intergroup attitudes 
(also see <a href="#c39">Rosenthal et al., 2011</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because
 work on other relevant ideologies such as multiculturalism and 
colorblindness have used a wide variety of measures, it might be 
worthwhile in future work to examine other measures of polyculturalism. 
In the present investigation we have used a neutral or valence-free 
measure of polyculturalism (also see <a href="#c39">Rosenthal et al., 2011</a>).
 Some people who endorse polyculturalism may almost exclusively focus on
 positive interactions among groups, which might foster more positive 
intergroup attitudes than a more neutral endorsement of polyculturalism;
 at the same time, a focus only on positive interactions and connections
 might ultimately have rebound effects because it is essentially a 
superficial or sugar-coated view of intergroup interactions. Moreover, 
some people who endorse polyculturalism may focus their attention on the
 negative interactions among groups, which would highlight instances of 
prejudice and discrimination, possibly resulting in greater intergroup 
hostility. Consistent with past work on multiculturalism and 
colorblindness, which have been shown to have different forms and been 
measured in multiple ways, it is important for future work to explore 
which elements or forms of polyculturalism have positive versus negative
 implications for intergroup attitudes (for a review, see <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It
 seems important also to consider the potential reach of endorsement of 
polyculturalism to other forms of prejudice and attitudes. For example, 
future work may also want to continue to explore the implications of 
polyculturalism for improving attitudes across numerous social 
categories, including gender, social class, sexual orientation, or 
physical ability (e.g., <a href="#c3">Banks, 2004</a>; <a href="#c34">Prashad, 2001</a>; <a href="#c58">Zirkel, 2008</a>). Indeed, some work has found that endorsement polyculturalism is associated with less prejudice toward gay men and lesbians (<a href="#c39">Rosenthal et al., 2011</a>) as well as less sexist attitudes (<a href="#c38">Rosenthal et al., under review</a>), suggesting exploring the connection between polyculturalism and other forms of prejudice is a fruitful line of inquiry.</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0EACAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_181" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></span><br xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The
 results of the current investigation represent an exciting first step 
toward showing the promise of polyculturalism as an ideology that has 
unique associations with positive intergroup attitudes, beyond the 
contributions of other well-studied ideologies and relevant variables. 
At the same time, we do not envision polyculturalism as “replacing” 
colorblindness and multiculturalism, nor do we think a line of inquiry 
suggesting that is desirable. Instead, we think findings from the 
present investigation, along with past findings, converge to suggest 
that no single ideology is likely ideal in all contexts, societies, and 
for all people, and that each ideology may make a unique contribution to
 intergroup attitudes and behaviors (e.g., <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>; <a href="#c43">Ryan et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c50">Verkuyten, 2006</a>; <a href="#c53">Wolsko et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#c55">Zárate &amp; Shaw, 2010</a>). As well, our work along with other work (e.g., <a href="#c43">Ryan et al., 2007</a>)
 suggests that these ideologies do not necessarily oppose each other, 
and can even be positively associated with each other, as people likely 
see merit in and simultaneously endorse multiple ideologies. And, while 
each ideology has some strengths and weaknesses, it is possible that 
endorsement of a combined or hybrid ideology that incorporates the 
strengths of polyculturalism, multiculturalism, and colorblindness may 
actually be ideal (for a review, see <a href="#c40">Rosenthal &amp; Levy, 2010</a>).
 We look forward to future work on intergroup ideologies involving the 
study of polyculturalism, in the hopes that research on intergroup 
ideologies can continue contributing to a greater understanding of 
intergroup attitudes and relations in our diverse world.</p><a id="cdp-18-1-1-ID0E01B0BBAA" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_185" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Allport, G.

 is an ideology focusing on the many ways that racial and ethnic groups 
have interacted, exchanged ideas, and influenced each other’s cultures 
throughout history and into the present. In this paper, we first briefly
 review the introduction of and research on polyculturalism by 
historians. Then we summarize numerous studies with racially and ethnic 
diverse college students and adult community members in the United 
States, which have found that greater endorsement of polyculturalism is 
significantly associated with more positive racial/ethnic intergroup 
attitudes (less support for social inequality, greater interest in, 
appreciation for, and comfort with diversity and differences, greater 
interest in intergroup contact, and greater support for liberal 
immigration and affirmative action policies) and lower sexual prejudice 
(lower affective prejudice toward gay men and lesbians, traditional 
heterosexism, and denial of discrimination against homosexuals, and more
 positive attitudes toward gay men and lesbians). We conclude by 
discussing several future directions of this work. (PsycINFO Database
