Abstract = {Competing approaches to the other-race effect (ORE) see its primary cause as either a lack of motivation to individuate social outgroup members, or a lack of perceptual experience with other-race faces. Here, we argue that the evidence supporting the social–motivational approach derives from a particular cultural setting: a high socio-economic status group (typically US Whites) looking at the faces of a lower status group (US Blacks) with whom observers typically have at least moderate perceptual experience. In contrast, we test motivation-to-individuate instructions across five studies covering an extremely wide range of perceptual experience, in a cultural setting of more equal socio-economic status, namely Asian and Caucasian participants (N = 480) tested on Asian and Caucasian faces. We find no social–motivational component at all to the ORE, specifically: no reduction in the ORE with motivation instructions, including for novel images of the faces, and at all experience levels; no increase in correlation between own- and other-race face recognition, implying no increase in shared processes; and greater (not the predicted less) effort applied to distinguishing other-race faces than own-race faces under normal (“no instructions”) conditions. Instead, the ORE was predicted by level of contact with the other-race. Our results reject both pure social–motivational theories and also the recent Categorization-Individuation model of Hugenberg, Young, Bernstein, and Sacco (2010). We propose a new dual-route approach to the ORE, in which there are two causes of the ORE—lack of motivation, and lack of experience—that contribute differently across varying world locations and cultural settings.

Abstract = {Observing the pain of others has been shown to elicit greater activation in sensory and emotional areas of the brain suggested to represent a neural marker of empathy. This modulation of brain responses to others' pain is dependent on the race of the observed person, such that observing own-race people in pain is associated with greater activity in the anterior cingulate and bilateral insula cortices compared to other-race people. Importantly, it is not known how this racial bias to pain in other-race individuals might change over time in new immigrants or might depend on the level and quality of contact with people of the other-race. We investigated these issues by recruiting Chinese students who had first arrived in Australia within the past 6 months to 5 years and assessing their level of contact with other races across different social contexts using comprehensive rating scales. During fMRI, participants observed videos of own-race/other-race individuals, as well as own-group/other-group individuals, receiving painful or non-painful touch. The typical racial bias in neural responses to observed pain was evident, whereby activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was greater for pain in own-race compared to other-race people. Crucially, activation in the anterior cingulate to pain in other races increased significantly with the level of contact participants reported with people of the other race. Importantly, this correlation did not depend on the closeness of contact or personal relationships, but simply on the overall level of experience with people of the other race in their every-day environment. Racial bias in neural responses to others' pain, as a neural marker of empathy, therefore changes with experience in new immigrants at least within 5 years of arrival in the new society and, crucially, depends on the level of contact with people of the other race in every-day life contexts.

Abstract = {The other-race effect (ORE) implies the better recognition of faces of one’s own race compared with faces of a different race. It demonstrates that face recognition is shaped by daily experience with human faces. Such experience mainly includes structural information of own-race faces and also information on the way faces are usually seen, as a whole or partly covered by scarves or other headwear. In two experiments, we investigated how this mode of presentation is related to the occurrence of the ORE during childhood. In Experiment 1, 4-year-old German children (N =104), accustomed to seeing faces without headwear in daily life, were asked to recognize female Caucasian or African faces, presented either as a whole or wearing a woolen hat, in a forced choice paradigm. In Experiment 2, 4-year-olds from rural Cameroon (N =70), accustomed to seeing faces with and without headwear in daily life, participated in the same task. In both groups, the ORE was present in the familiar mode of presentation, that is, in whole faces in German children and in whole and partly covered faces in Cameroonian children. The results are discussed in relation to the role of experience for face recognition processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Face recognition is an important component of successful social interactions in humans. A large literature in social psychology has focused on the phenomenon termed the “other race” (ORE) effect, the tendency to be more proficient with face recognition within one’s own ethnic group compared with other ethnic groups. Several potential hypotheses have been proposed for this effect, including perceptual expertise, social grouping, and holistic face processing. Recent work on mnemonic discrimination (i.e., the ability to resolve mnemonic interference among similar experiences) may provide a mechanistic account for the ORE. In the current study, we examined how discrimination and generalization in the presence of mnemonic interference may contribute to the ORE. We developed a database of computerized faces divided evenly among ethnic origins (Black, Caucasian, East Asian, South Asian), as well as morphed face stimuli that varied in the amount of similarity to the original stimuli (30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% morphs). Participants first examined the original unmorphed stimuli during study, then during test were asked to judge the prior occurrence of repetitions (targets), morphed stimuli (lures), and new stimuli (foils). We examined participants’ ability to correctly reject similar morphed lures and found that it increased linearly as a function of face dissimilarity. We additionally found that Caucasian participants’ mnemonic discrimination–generalization functions were sharply tuned for Caucasian faces but considerably less tuned for East Asian and Black faces. These results suggest that expertise plays an important role in resolving mnemonic interference, which may offer a mechanistic account for the ORE.

Abstract = {People are more accurate at recognizing faces of their own race than faces from other races, a phenomenon known as the other-race effect. Other-race effects have also been reported in some perceptual tasks. Across 3 experiments, White and Chinese participants completed recognition tests as well as the complete paradigm of the composite task, which measures participants’ abilities to selectively attend to the target region of a face while ignoring the task-irrelevant region of the face. Each task was completed with both own- and other-race faces. At a group level, participants showed significant own-race effects in recognition, but not in the composite task. At an individual difference level, the results provided no support for the hypothesis that a deficit in holistic processing for other-race faces drives the other-race effect in recognition. We therefore conclude that the other-race effect in recognition is not driven by the processes that underpin the composite effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Congenital prosopagnosia (CP), an innate impairment in recognizing faces, as well as the other-race effect (ORE), a disadvantage in recognizing faces of foreign races, both affect face recognition abilities. Are the same face processing mechanisms affected in both situations? To investigate this question, we tested three groups of 21 participants: German congenital prosopagnosics, South Korean participants and German controls on three different tasks involving faces and objects. First we tested all participants on the Cambridge Face Memory Test in which they had to recognize Caucasian target faces in a 3-alternative-forced-choice task. German controls performed better than Koreans who performed better than prosopagnosics. In the second experiment, participants rated the similarity of Caucasian faces that differed parametrically in either features or second-order relations (configuration). Prosopagnosics were less sensitive to configuration changes than both other groups. In addition, while all groups were more sensitive to changes in features than in configuration, this difference was smaller in Koreans. In the third experiment, participants had to learn exemplars of artificial objects, natural objects, and faces and recognize them among distractors of the same category. Here prosopagnosics performed worse than participants in the other two groups only when they were tested on face stimuli. In sum, Koreans and prosopagnosic participants differed from German controls in different ways in all tests. This suggests that German congenital prosopagnosics perceive Caucasian faces differently than do Korean participants. Importantly, our results suggest that different processing impairments underlie the ORE and CP. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Behavioral research has suggested a trade-off relationship between individual recognition and race categorization of own- and other-race faces, which is an important behavioral marker of face processing expertise. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this trade-off. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology, we concurrently asked participants to recognize and categorize own- and other-race faces to examine the neural correlates of this trade-off relationship. We found that for other-race faces, the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA) responded more to recognition than categorization, whereas for own-race faces, the responses were equal for the 2 tasks. The right superior temporal sulcus (STS) responses were the opposite to those of the FFA and OFA. Further, recognition enhanced the functional connectivity from the right FFA to the right STS, whereas categorization enhanced the functional connectivity from the right OFA to the right STS. The modulatory effects of these 2 couplings were negatively correlated. Our findings suggested that within the core face processing network, although recognizing and categorizing own- and other-race faces activated the same neural substrates, there existed neural trade-offs whereby their activations and functional connectivities were modulated by face race type and task demand due to one’s differential processing expertise with own- and other-race faces.

Abstract = {Poorer recognition of other-race faces relative to own-race faces is well documented from late infancy to adulthood. Research has revealed an increase in the other-race effect (ORE) during the first year of life, but there is some disagreement regarding the age at which it emerges. Using cropped faces to eliminate discrimination based on external features, visual paired comparison and spontaneous visual preference measures were used to investigate the relationship between ORE and face gender at 3–4 and 8–9 months. Caucasian-White 3- to 4-month-olds’ discrimination of Chinese, Malay, and Caucasian-White faces showed an own-race advantage for female faces alone whereas at 8–9 months the own-race advantage was general across gender. This developmental effect is accompanied by a preference for female over male faces at 4 months and no gender preference at 9 months. The pattern of recognition advantage and preference suggests that there is a shift from a female-based own-race recognition advantage to a general own-race recognition advantage, in keeping with a visual and social experience-based account of ORE.

Abstract = {The present study examined whether perceptual individuation training with other‐race faces could reduce preschool children's implicit racial bias. We used an ‘angry = outgroup’ paradigm to measure Chinese children's implicit racial bias against African individuals before and after training. In Experiment 1, children between 4 and 6 years were presented with angry or happy racially ambiguous faces that were morphed between Chinese and African faces. Initially, Chinese children demonstrated implicit racial bias: they categorized happy racially ambiguous faces as own‐race (Chinese) and angry racially ambiguous faces as other‐race (African). Then, the children participated in a training session where they learned to individuate African faces. Children's implicit racial bias was significantly reduced after training relative to that before training. Experiment 2 used the same procedure as Experiment 1, except that Chinese children were trained with own‐race Chinese faces. These children did not display a significant reduction in implicit racial bias. Our results demonstrate that early implicit racial bias can be reduced by presenting children with other‐race face individuation training, and support a linkage between perceptual and social representations of face information in children.

Abstract = {Face recognition, holistic processing, and processing of configural and featural facial information are known to be influenced by face race, with better performance for own- than other-race faces. However, whether these various other-race effects (OREs) arise from the same underlying mechanisms or from different processes remains unclear. The present study addressed this question by measuring the OREs in a set of face recognition tasks, and testing whether these OREs are correlated with each other. Participants performed different tasks probing (1) face recognition, (2) holistic processing, (3) processing of configural information, and (4) processing of featural information for both own- and other-race faces. Their contact with other-race people was also assessed with a questionnaire. The results show significant OREs in tasks testing face memory and processing of configural information, but not in tasks testing either holistic processing or processing of featural information. Importantly, there was no cross-task correlation between any of the measured OREs. Moreover, the level of other-race contact predicted only the OREs obtained in tasks testing face memory and processing of configural information. These results indicate that these various cross-race differences originate from different aspects of face processing, in contrary to the view that the ORE in face recognition is due to cross-race differences in terms of holistic processing.

Since the amplitude of the P3 is sensitive primarily to the perceptual demands of a task, these data suggest that the delay of the own-race classification is caused by an own-race specific process that precedes or interferes with the subordinate classification.

Abstract = {Abstract Infants can form object categories based on perceptual cues, but their ability to form categories based on differential experience is less clear. Here we examined whether infants filter through perceptual differences among faces from different other‐race classes and represent them as a single other‐race class different only from own‐race faces. We used a familiarization/novelty‐preference procedure to investigate category formation for two other‐race face classes (Black vs. Asian) by White 6‐ and 9‐month‐olds. The data indicated that while White 6‐month‐olds categorically represented the distinction between Black and Asian faces, White 9‐month‐olds formed a broad other‐race category inclusive of Black and Asian faces, but exclusive of own‐race White faces. The findings provide evidence that narrowing can occur for mental processes other than discrimination: category formation is also affected. The results suggest that frequency of experience with own‐race versus other‐race classes of faces may propel infants to contrast own‐race faces with other‐race faces, but not different classes of other‐race faces with each other.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2015-10997-001[/rid]). The ability of face discrimination is modulated by the frequency of exposure to a category of faces. In other words, lower discrimination performance was measured for infrequently encountered faces as opposed to frequently encountered ones. This phenomenon has been described in the literature: the own-race advantage, a benefit in processing own-race as opposed to the other-race faces, and the own-species advantage, a benefit in processing the conspecific type of faces as opposed to the heterospecific type. So far, the exact parameters that drive either of these two effects are not fully understood. In the following we present a full assessment of data in human participants describing the discrimination performances across two races (Asian and Caucasian) as well as a range of non-human primate faces (chimpanzee, Rhesus macaque and marmoset).We measured reaction times of Asian participants performing a delayed matching-to-sample task, and correlated the results with similarity estimates of facial configuration and face parts. We found faster discrimination of own-race above other-race/species faces. Further, we found a strong reliance on configural information in upright own-species/-race faces and on individual face parts in all inverted face classes, supporting the assumption of specialized processing for the face class of most frequent exposure.

Abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) process human faces in atypical ways according to previous literature. We investigated whether individuals with ASD can process face race information and respond to own- and other-race faces differentially. Chinese individuals with ASD (n = 24), typically developing (TD) individuals (n = 28), and individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID, n = 26) were asked to recognize Chinese and Caucasian faces in an old-new face paradigm using eye tracking. In terms of recognition, the ASD and ID groups did not perform differently and displayed superior own-race recognition compared with other-race faces; TD participants displayed similar recognition of the two types of faces. In terms of eye tracking, the TD, ASD, and ID groups displayed more looking on the eyes and less looking on the nose and mouth of Caucasian faces relative to Chinese faces. Overall, individuals with ASD manifested a behavioral other-race effect and displayed the same type of cross-racial differentiation in face scanning observed in TD individuals. The findings suggest that as is the case with TD individuals, face processing of individuals with ASD is influenced by differences in visual experience with different face categories.

Abstract = {Both face shape and pigmentation are diagnostic cues for face identification and categorization. In particular, both shape and pigmentation contribute to observers’ categorization of faces by race. Although many theoretical accounts of the behavioral other-race effect either explicitly or implicitly depend on differential use of visual information as a function of category expertise, there is little evidence that observers do in fact differentially rely on distinct visual cues for own- and other-race faces. In the current study, we examined how Asian and Caucasian children (4–6 years of age) and adults use three-dimensional shape and two-dimensional pigmentation to make similarity judgments of White, Black, and Asian faces. Children in this age range are capable of making category judgments about race but also are sufficiently plastic with regard to the behavioral other-race effect that it seems as though their representations of facial appearance across different categories are still emerging. Using a simple match-to-sample similarity task, we found that children tend to use pigmentation to judge facial similarity more than adults and also that own-group versus other-group category membership appears to influence how quickly children learn to use shape information more readily. Therefore, we suggest that children continue to adjust how different visual information is weighted during early and middle childhood and that experience with faces affects the speed at which adult-like weightings are established.

Abstract = {Adults recognize own-race faces more accurately than other-race faces. We investigated three characteristics of laboratory investigations hypothesized to minimize the magnitude of the own-race recognition advantage (ORA): lack of competition for attention and instructions that emphasize individuating faces during the study phase, and a lack of uncertainty during the test phase. Across two experiments, participants studied faces individually, in arrays comprising multiple faces and household objects, or in naturalistic scenes (presented on an eye-tracker); they were instructed to remember everything, memorize faces, or form impressions of people. They then completed one of two recognition tasks—an old/new recognition task or a lineup recognition task. Task instructions influenced time spent looking at faces but not the allocation of attention to own- versus other-race faces. The magnitude of the ORA was independent of both task instructions and test protocol, with some modulation by how faces were presented in the study phase. We discuss these results in light of current theories of the ORA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

This study sought to describe pleasure, affection, and love experienced by Black men who have sex with men (MSM) during their last male-partnered sexual event and to examine differences relative to White, Latino, and Asian MSM. A total of 21,696 (793 Black, 18,905 White, 1,451 Latino, and 547 Asian) U.S. men ages 18–87 (M Age = 39) were recruited from social/sexual networking sites targeting MSM in 2010–2011. Participants reported multiple dimensions of sexual experience (pleasure, affection, and love) occurring at their last male-partnered sexual event, partner relationship, and sociodemographic characteristics. Across relationship categories, a sizeable percentage of Black MSM reported pleasure (72–87 % orgasmed, 57–82 % experienced high subjective pleasure) and affection (70–91 % kissed, 47–90 % cuddled). Love was primarily reported for events involving main partners (felt love for partner: 96 %; felt loved by partner: 97 %; verbalized love to partner: 89 %). Latent class analysis with MSM of all races, adjusting for partner relationship and sociodemographic characteristics, revealed three distinct profiles of sexual experience: affection and love (Class 1); affection in the absence of love (Class 2); and neither affection nor love (Class 3). Pleasure was probable across profiles. Some racial differences in profile probability were present, but no overall pattern emerged. Contrary to Black male stereotypes, Black MSM commonly reported pleasure, affection, and love at their last male-partnered sexual event and did not show a meaningful pattern of difference from other-race MSM in their likelihood of experiencing all three.

Abstract = {Human beings do not passively perceive important social features about others such as race and age in social interactions. Instead, it is proposed that humans might continuously generate predictions about these social features based on prior similar experiences. Pre-awareness of racial information conveyed by others’ faces enables individuals to act in "culturally appropriate" ways, which is useful for interpersonal relations in different ethnicity groups. However, little is known about the effects of prediction on the perception for own-race and other-race faces. Here, we addressed this issue using high temporal resolution event-related potential techniques. In total, data from 24 participants (13 women and 11 men) were analyzed. It was found that the N170 amplitudes elicited by other-race faces, but not own-race faces, were significantly smaller in the predictable condition compared to the unpredictable condition, reflecting a switch to holistic processing of other-race faces when those faces were predictable. In this respect, top-down prediction about face race might contribute to the elimination of the other-race effect (one face recognition impairment). Furthermore, smaller P300 amplitudes were observed for the predictable than for unpredictable conditions, which suggested that the prediction of race reduced the neural responses of human brains.

Abstract = {Memory of own-race faces is generally better than memory of other-races faces. This other-race effect (ORE) in face memory has been attributed to differences in contact, holistic processing, and motivation to individuate faces. Since most studies demonstrate the ORE with participants learning and recognizing static, single-view faces, it remains unclear whether the ORE can be generalized to different face learning conditions. Using an old/new recognition task, we tested whether face format at encoding modulates the ORE. The results showed a significant ORE when participants learned static, single-view faces (Experiment 1). In contrast, the ORE disappeared when participants learned rigidly moving faces (Experiment 2). Moreover, learning faces displayed from four discrete views produced the same results as learning rigidly moving faces (Experiment 3). Contact with other-race faces was correlated with the magnitude of the ORE. Nonetheless, the absence of the ORE in Experiments 2 and 3 cannot be readily explained by either more frequent contact with other-race faces or stronger motivation to individuate them. These results demonstrate that the ORE is sensitive to face format at encoding, supporting the hypothesis that relative involvement of holistic and featural processing at encoding mediates the ORE observed in face memory.

Abstract = {It has long been known that a person’s race can affect their decisions about people of another race; an observation that clearly taps into some deep societal issues. However, in order to behave differently in response to someone else’s race, you must first categorise that person as other-race. The current study investigates the process of race-categorisation. Two groups of participants, Asian and Caucasian, rapidly classified facial images that varied from strongly Asian, through racially intermediate, to strongly Caucasian. In agreement with previous findings, there was a difference in category boundary between the two groups. Asian participants more frequently judged intermediate images as Caucasian and vice versa. We fitted a decision model, the Ratcliff diffusion model, to our two choice reaction time data. This model provides an account of the processes thought to underlie binary choice decisions. Within its architecture it has two components that could reasonably lead to a difference in race category boundary, these being evidence accumulation rate and a priori bias. The latter is the expectation or prior belief that a participant brings to the task, whilst the former indexes sensitivity to race-dependent perceptual cues. Whilst we find no good evidence for a difference in a priori bias between our two groups, we do find evidence for a difference in evidence accumulation rate. Our Asian participants were more sensitive to Caucasian cues within the images than were our Caucasian participants (and vice versa). These results support the idea that differences in perceptual sensitivity to race-defining visual characteristics drive differences in race categorisation. We propose that our findings fit with a wider view in which perceptual adaptation plays a central role in the visual processing of own and other race.

Abstract = {Other-race effects in recognition memory of faces have been well documented: It is often more difficult to recognize other-race (OR) versus same-race (SR) faces (Meissner & Brigham, 2001). However, the mechanisms underlying such effects remain unknown. Recent work has shown that OR and SR faces are processed in the same qualitative manner—both SR and OR faces are processed holistically (Bukach, Cottle, Ubiwa, & Miller, 2012). Here, we manipulate stimulus presentation times to test whether there are quantitative processing differences between OR and SR faces. We found that Caucasian and Asian participants processed both OR and SR faces holistically, but there were differences in overall discrimination ability (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we observed a similar discrimination advantage for SR faces categorized as belonging to an ingroup versus outgroup (see Hugenberg & Corneille, 2009) but no differences in holistic processing. Together, our results suggest that OR and SR faces differ in the efficiency with which they are encoded and processed, possibly as a consequence of social categorization that discourages individuation of outgroup (and OR) faces.

The current study addressed this issue using high time resolution event-related potential techniques. In total, data from 25 participants (13 women and 12 men) were analyzed. It was found that women showed increased N170 amplitudes to negative White faces compared with negative Chinese faces over the right hemisphere electrodes. This result suggests that women show enhanced sensitivity to other-race faces showing negative emotions (fear or disgust), which may contribute toward evolution. However, the current data showed that men had increased N170 amplitudes to happy Chinese versus happy White faces over the left hemisphere electrodes, indicating that men show enhanced sensitivity to own-race faces showing positive emotions (happiness). In this respect, men might use past pleasant emotional experiences to boost recognition of own-race faces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose The cross‐race effect can be exaggerated when faces are presented in groups, leading to less accurate eyewitness identifications (Pezdek, O'Brien, & Wasson, , Law Hum. Behav., 36, 488). Our current study examined the effect of entitativity, the degree to which members of a group are perceived as a coherent unit (Campbell, , Behav. Sci., 3, 14), on recognition accuracy for same‐ and cross‐race faces presented in groups. Methods White participants viewed 16 slides of 3‐face groups (eight White groups, eight Black groups). Prior to viewing the faces they were told that the entitativity of each 3‐face group was high (‘friends who do things together’) or low (‘people in line at the bank’). They were then tested on 32 individually presented faces (16 old and 16 new). Results When cross‐race faces were presented in high rather than low entitativity groups, less accurate face recognition memory resulted. Increasing group entitativity decreased recognition accuracy for cross‐race faces but increased recognition accuracy for same‐race faces. Conclusions The results suggest that the perception of a group negatively impacts eyewitness memory. Contextual factors such as entitativity need to be considered along with other estimator variables when assessing eyewitness identification accuracy.

Abstract = {The current research examined the influence of ingroup/outgroup categorization on brain event-related potentials measured during perceptual processing of own- and other-race faces. White participants performed a sequential matching task with upright and inverted faces belonging either to their own race (White) or to another race (Black) and affiliated with either their own university or another university by a preceding visual prime. Results demonstrated that the right-lateralized N170 component evoked by test faces was modulated by race and by social category: the N170 to own-race faces showed a larger inversion effect (i.e., latency delay for inverted faces) when the faces were categorized as other-university rather than own-university members; the N170 to other-race faces showed no modulation of its inversion effect by university affiliation. These results suggest that neural correlates of structural face encoding (as evidenced by the N170 inversion effects) can be modulated by both visual (racial) and nonvisual (social) ingroup/outgroup status.

Abstract = {The current study examined developmental differences from the age of 5 to 18 in the creation process of own- and other-race facial composites. In addition, it considered how differences in the creation process affect similarity ratings. Participants created two composites (one own- and one other-race) from memory. The complexity of the composite creation process was recorded during Phase One. In Phase Two, a separate group of participants rated the composites for similarity to the corresponding target face. Results support the cross-race effect, developmental differences (based on composite creators) in similarity ratings, and the importance of the creation process for own- and other-race facial composites. Together, these findings suggest that as children get older the process through which they create facial composites becomes more complex and their ability to create facial composites improves. Increased complexity resulted in higher rated composites. Results are discussed from a psycho-legal perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The results of the study demonstrated that the other-race effect in face recognition is sensitive to the face format at encoding. The equivalent performance in recognizing own-race and other-race faces suggests that face shown in motion or in multiviews may modulate the holistic processing engaged in own-race faces processing and/or improve the poor structural information of other-race faces. The categorization-individuation model has difficulty to readily account for the data, as there was no manipulation of motivation to categorize/individualize faces at encoding.

Abstract = {Recognizing individual faces is an important human ability that highly depends on experience. This is reflected in the so called other-race effect; adults are better at recognizing faces from their own ethnic group, while very young infants do not show this specialization yet. Two experiments examined whether 3-year-old children from two different cultural backgrounds show the other-race effect. In Experiment 1, German children (N = 41)were presented with a forced choice paradigm where they were asked to recognize female Caucasian or African faces. In Experiment 2, 3-year-olds from Cameroon (N = 66) participated in a similar task using the same stimulus material. In both cultures the other-race effect was present; children were better at recognizing individual faces from their own ethnic group. In addition, German children performed at a higher overall level of accuracy than Cameroonians. The results are discussed in relation to cultural aspects in particular.

Abstract = {Using the event-related potential (ERP) approach, we tracked the time-course of white participants empathic reactions to white (own-race) and black (other-race) faces displayed in a painful condition (i.e. with a needle penetrating the skin) and in a nonpainful condition (i.e. with Q-tip touching the skin). In a 280–340 ms time-window, neural responses to the pain of own-race individuals under needle penetration conditions were amplified relative to neural responses to the pain of other-race individuals displayed under analogous conditions. This ERP reaction to pain, whose source was localized in the inferior frontal gyrus, correlated with the empathic concern ratings of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index questionnaire. In a 400–750 ms time-window, the difference between neural reactions to the pain of own-race individuals, localized in the middle frontal gyrus and other-race individuals, localized in the temporoparietal junction was reduced to nil. These findings support a functional, neural and temporal distinction between two sequential processing stages underlying empathy, namely, a race-biased stage of pain sharing/mirroring followed by a race-unbiased stage of cognitive evaluation of pain.

Abstract = {We investigated the development of the other-race effect “ORE” in a longitudinal sample of 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old Caucasian infants. Previous research using cross-sectional samples has shown an unstable ORE at 3 months, an increase at 6 months and full development at 9 months. In Experiment 1, we tested whether 9-month-olds showed the ORE with Caucasian and African faces. As expected, the 9-month-olds discriminated faces within their own ethnicity (Caucasian) but not within the unfamiliar ethnicity (African). In Experiment 2, we longitudinally tested infants at 3, 6, and 9 months by presenting either the Caucasian or the African faces used in Experiment 1. In contrast to previous cross-sectional studies and Experiment 1, we found that infants discriminated between all stimuli. Hence, we did not find the ORE in this longitudinal study even at 9 months. We assume that the infants in our longitudinal study showed no ORE because of previous repetitive exposure to African faces at 3 and 6 months. We argue that only a few presentations of faces from other ethnic categories sufficiently slow the development of the ORE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {We used a matching-to-sample task and manipulated facial pose and feature composition to examine the other-race effect (ORE) in face identity recognition between 5 and 10 years of age. Overall, the present findings provide a genuine measure of own- and other-race face identity recognition in children that is independent of photographic and image processing. The current study also confirms the presence of an ORE in children as young as 5 years of age using a recognition paradigm that is sensitive to their developing cognitive abilities. In addition, the present findings show that with age, increasing experience with familiar classes of own-race faces and further lack of experience with unfamiliar classes of other-race faces serves to maintain the ORE between 5 and 10 years of age rather than exacerbate the effect. All age groups also showed a differential effect of stimulus facial pose in their recognition of the internal regions of own- and other-race faces. Own-race inner faces were remembered best when three-quarter poses were used during familiarization and frontal poses were used during the recognition test. In contrast, other-race inner faces were remembered best when frontal poses were used during familiarization and three-quarter poses were used during the recognition test. Thus, children encode and/or retrieve own- and other-race faces from memory in qualitatively different ways. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Psychological research has consistently demonstrated that individuals are better at discriminating faces of their own race when compared with faces of another, less familiar race. Given the racial/ethnic diversity of individuals screened by security personnel at transportation and border checkpoints, it is important to understand whether the cross-race effect may play a role in simultaneous perceptual discrimination tasks that mimic such screening operations. Three experiments assessed the deleterious effects of cross-racial identification in this context. Results demonstrated greater discrimination accuracy for own- versus other-race faces, and a propensity for screeners to be overconfident in their decisions, particularly for other-race persons. Further, perceived age differences between the target and his identification photo and the use of a disguise were found to moderate cross-race effects during this task.

Abstract = {The own‐race bias refers to the finding that individuals are better able to recognize faces of the same race or ethnicity compared with faces of another race or ethnicity. The current study examined whether the own‐race bias was also evident in participants' predictions of memory performance and their self‐regulation of learning. In three experiments, participants studied own‐race and other‐race faces and predicted the likelihood of recognizing each face on a future test. Experiment 1 showed that participants provided similar predictions for own‐race and other‐race faces, despite superior recognition of own‐race faces. Experiments 2 and 3 permitted participants to control their study of faces and revealed better self‐regulation of learning for own‐race relative to other‐race faces. Collectively, these experiments suggest that the own‐race bias may partially reflect a metacognitive deficiency, as participants are less able to effectively self‐regulate learning for other‐race faces. The implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The present study used the functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) methodology to investigate the neural correlates of elementary school children's own- and other-race face processing. An old-new paradigm was used to assess children's recognition ability of own- and other-race faces. FNIRS data revealed that other-race faces elicited significantly greater [oxy-Hb] changes than own-race faces in the right middle frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus regions (BA9) and the left cuneus (BA18). With increased age, the [oxy-Hb] activity differences between own- and other-race faces, or the neural other-race effect (NORE), underwent significant changes in these two cortical areas: at younger ages, the neural response to the other-race faces was modestly greater than that to the own-race faces, but with increased age, the neural response to the own-race faces became increasingly greater than that to the other-race faces. Moreover, these areas had strong regional functional connectivity with a swath of the cortical regions in terms of the neural other-race effect that also changed with increased age. We also found significant and positive correlations between the behavioral other-race effect (reaction time) and the neural other-race effect in the right middle frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus regions (BA9). These results taken together suggest that children, like adults, devote different amounts of neural resources to processing own- and other-race faces, but the size and direction of the neural other-race effect and associated functional regional connectivity change with increased age.

Abstract = {We are typically more accurate at remembering own- than other-race faces. This “own-race bias” has been suggested to result from enhanced expertise with and more efficient perceptual processing of own-race than other-race faces. In line with this idea, the N170, an event-related potential correlate of face perception, has been repeatedly found to be larger for other-race faces. Other studies, however, found no difference in N170 amplitude for faces from diverse ethnic groups. The present study tested whether these seemingly incongruent findings can be explained by varying task demands. European participants were presented with upright and inverted European and Asian faces (as well as European and Asian houses), and asked to either indicate the ethnicity or the orientation of the stimuli. Larger N170s for other-race faces were observed in the ethnicity but not in the orientation task, suggesting that the necessity to process facial category information is a minimum prerequisite for the occurrence of the effect. In addition, N170 inversion effects, with larger amplitudes for inverted relative to upright stimuli, were more pronounced for own- relative to other-race faces in both tasks. Overall, the present findings suggest that the occurrence of ethnicity effects in N170 for upright faces depends on the amount of facial detail required for the task at hand. At the same time, the larger inversion effects for own- than other-race faces occur independent of task and may reflect the fine-tuning of perceptual processing to faces of maximum expertise.

From 6 to 9 months, infants increased their looking time for the eyes of both races of faces. Analyses of scan paths showed that infants were no more likely to shift their fixation between the eyes of own‐race faces than other‐race faces. Similarity between participants' scan paths suggested that facial information was collected more efficiently for own‐ versus other‐race faces at 9 months of age.

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite widespread documentation of racial/ethnic disparities in medical care, population-wide variation in Americans’ experiences with care are not well understood. We examined whether race/ethnicity is associated with information received from physicians regarding treatment recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data from a nationally representative sample (N=1238). We assessed patients’ personal experiences of receiving information about the rationale for treatment recommendations from their physicians. RESULTS: Overall, respondents of minority race/ethnicity received less information from their doctors about the rationale for treatment recommendations. After adjustment for possible confounders, doctors talked less often with patients of ‘other’ race/ethnicity about reasons for treatment recommendations. Both Blacks’ and Hispanics’ doctors less often cited their own experiences, or scientific research as a reason for treatment recommendations. CONCLUSION: Americans’ experiences with information communicated by physicians regarding treatment rationale varies significantly on some dimensions by race/ethnicity, suggesting that differences in key elements of shared decision making are evident in the care of racial/ethnic minorities. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Physicians should evaluate the extent to which their communication with patients varies by patient race/ethnicity, and make efforts to ensure that they share equally with all patients regarding the rationale for treatment recommendations.

Both younger and older adults demonstrated an ORB. Signal detection estimates suggest younger adults compared to older adults have better discrimination accuracy for own-race over other-race faces.

Abstract = {Recognition accuracy for faces of an individual's own race typically exceeds recognition accuracy for other‐race faces. The categorization–individuation model (Hugenberg, Young, Bernstein, & Sacco, 2010) attributes this cross‐race effect to motivation to encode distinctive features of own‐race faces but category defining features for other‐race faces. Two experiments using different stimuli tested hypotheses generated from this model with both Black and White participants. For White participants, instructions to individuate reduced the cross‐race effect in both studies but did not eliminate it in Study 1. Black participants did not exhibit the cross‐race effect in either study, but individuation instructions improved both their same‐race and other‐race sensitivity. The present quality of interracial contact moderated the relationship between instructions and other‐race sensitivity for both Black and White participants in Study 1 but not in Study 2.

Abstract = {Oxytocin has been shown to affect human social information processing including recognition memory for faces. Here we investigated the neural processes underlying the effect of oxytocin on memorizing own-race and other-race faces in men and women. In a placebocontrolled, double-blind, between-subject study, participants received either oxytocin or placebo before studying own-race and other-race faces. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during both the study and recognition phase to investigate neural correlates of oxytocin’s effect on memory encoding, memory retrieval, and perception. Oxytocin increased the accuracy of familiarity judgments in the recognition test. Neural correlates for this effect were found in ERPs related to memory encoding and retrieval but not perception. In contrast to its facilitating effects on familiarity, oxytocin impaired recollection judgments, but in men only. Oxytocin did not differentially affect own-race and other-race faces. This study shows that oxytocin influences memory, but not perceptual processes, in a face recognition task and is the first to reveal sex differences in the effect of oxytocin on face memory. Contrary to recent findings in oxytocin and moral decision making, oxytocin did not preferentially improve memory for own-race faces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Faces from another race are generally more difficult to recognize than faces from one's own race. However, faces provide multiple cues for recognition and it remains unknown what are the relative contribution of these cues to this “other-race effect”. In the current study, we used three-dimensional laser-scanned head models which allowed us to independently manipulate two prominent cues for face recognition: the facial shape morphology and the facial surface properties (texture and colour). In Experiment 1, Asian and Caucasian participants implicitly learned a set of Asian and Caucasian faces that had both shape and surface cues to facial identity. Their recognition of these encoded faces was then tested in an old/new recognition task. For these face stimuli, we found a robust other-race effect: Both groups were more accurate at recognizing own-race than other-race faces. Having established the other-race effect, in Experiment 2 we provided only shape cues for recognition and in Experiment 3 we provided only surface cues for recognition. Caucasian participants continued to show the other-race effect when only shape information was available, whereas Asian participants showed no effect. When only surface information was available, there was a weak pattern for the other-race effect in Asians. Performance was poor in this latter experiment, so this pattern needs to be interpreted with caution. Overall, these findings suggest that Asian and Caucasian participants rely differently on shape and surface cues to recognize own-race faces, and that they continue to use the same cues for other-race faces, which may be suboptimal for these faces.

Abstract = {Psychological studies have long shown that human memory is superior for faces of our own-race than for faces of other-races. In this paper, we review computational studies of own- versus other-race face processing. Computational models examine the visual challenges of representing the uniqueness of individual faces that vary both within and across demographic categories. These models isolate the visual components of the other-race effect and provide an objective control for socioaffective responses to other-race faces. This control allows researchers to compare and test the role of experience/contact in the other-race effect, using various operational definitions of this theoretical construct. The models show that to produce an other-race effect computationally, biased experience or learning must intervene during the process of feature selection. This implicates the critical importance of “developmental” learning in the other-race effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Psychological studies have long shown that human memory is superior for faces of our own-race than for faces of other-races. In this paper, we review neural studies of own- versus other-race face processing. These studies divide naturally into those focused on socioaffective aspects of the other-race effect and those directed at high-level visual processing differences. The socioaffective studies consider how subconscious bias and emotional responses affect brain areas such as the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus. The visual studies focus on face-selective areas in the ventral stream, such as the fusiform face area (FFA). In both cases, factors such as experience, familiarity, social/emotional responses, cultural learning, and bias modulate the patterns of neural activity elicited in response to own- and other-race faces.

Abstract = {The other-race effect (ORE) refers to the own-race discrimination advantage and the other-race categorization advantage. The perceptual expertise theory explains the ORE as a result of people's long-term perceptual exposure to own-race faces much more than the other-race faces. However, recent findings suggest that short-term, social-cognitive factors, such as reduced motivation to individuate other-race faces, may also contribute to the ORE. To examine the effect of short-term factor on face perceptual processing, we manipulated perceptual adaptation in three experiments and investigated participants' face race perception and discrimination. In Experiment 1, 20 Asian participants were presented with 704 color Asian-Caucasian morphed face stimuli for a race categorization task. These stimuli were generated with morphing software (Morph™), allowing the creation of 11 blended face stimuli (from 0:100 to 100:0 for Asian:Caucasian proportions, respectively) for each of 64 Asian-Caucasian continua. In each continuum, the face that was equally often categorized as Asian and as Caucasian was identified as the ambiguous-race face. Result showed that the 52 Asian-Caucasian ambiguous faces were extracted and used as face stimuli in experiment 2 and experiment 3. In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of perceptual adaptation on face race categorization performance by presenting the ambiguous-race faces after prolonged exposure (5 seconds) to a Caucasian or an Asian face. Results showed that prolonged exposure to Asian faces causes the identical ambiguous-race morphed faces to appear distinctly Caucasian, vice versa. Furthermore, the identical ambiguous-race morphed faces were categorized faster when the faces were perceived as Caucasian but slower when the faces were perceived as Asian. In experiment 3, we examined the effects of perceptual adaptation on face discrimination by presenting the ambiguous-race faces after prolonged exposure (5 seconds) to a Caucasian or an Asian face. Results showed that the identical ambiguous-race morphed faces were discriminated more accurate when the faces were perceived as Asian but less accurate when the faces were perceived as Caucasian. Collectively, these findings indicate that the short-term, perceptual adaptation may affect participants' face race categorization and perceptual discrimination, suggesting social-cognitive factors also play a role in the ORE.

Abstract = {We evaluate claims that the other-race effect in face memory reflects stronger holistic coding of own-race than other-race faces. Considering evidence from a range of paradigms, including the inversion effect, part–whole effect, composite effect, and the scrambled/blurred task, we find considerable inconsistency, both between paradigms and between participant ethnicities. At the same time, however, studies that isolate configural and component feature processing consistently show better featural, as well as better configural, processing of own-race faces, for both Caucasian and Asian participants. These results raise the possibility that the key feature of own-race face processing is not stronger holistic processing per se, but rather more effective processing of all types of face information (featural as well as holistic).

Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that our ability to recognize own-race faces can be treated as a form of perceptual expertise. Similar to object experts (e.g., birdwatchers), people differentiate own-race faces at the subordinate level of categorization. In contrast, like novices, we tend to classify other-race faces at the basic level of race. We demonstrate that, as a form of perceptual expertise, other-race face recognition can be systematically taught in the lab through subordinate-level training. When participants learn to quickly and accurately differentiate other-race faces at the subordinate level of the individual, the individuating training transfers to improved recognition of untrained other-race faces, produces changes in event-related brain components, and reduces implicit racial bias. Subsequent work has shown that other-race learning can be optimized by directing participants to the diagnostic features of a racial group. The benefits of other-race training are fairly long-lived and are evident even 2 weeks after training. Collectively, the training studies demonstrate the plasticity of other-race face recognition. Rather than a process that is fixed by early developmental events, other-race face recognition is malleable and dynamic, continually being reshaped by the perceptual experiences of the observer.

Abstract = {This study provides experimental evidence for a cognitive mechanism underlying racial discrimination. Specifically, we study memory biases in the ability to remember people within and across races, in a context where there is no difference in the distribution of payoffs across racial groups. Participants see pictures of people—whom we call candidates—of White and East Asian origin, learn payoff-relevant information about them, and then are asked to identify the candidates associated with the highest payoffs. I find that people are much better able to recall candidates with higher payoffs if they are of the same race. Candidates of the other race are more likely to be confused with each other. This leads to positive and negative discrimination at the same time: those at the bottom of the distribution benefit whereas those at the top lose out. These results suggest that cognitive biases could play a role in the nature of cross-racial relations, in particular for phenomena relying on repeated interactions and individual recognition, such as the formation and maintenance of social ties and the establishment of trust relationships.

Abstract = {Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition with a distinctive social phenotype characterized by excessive sociability accompanied by a relative proficiency in face recognition, despite severe deficits in the visuospatial domain of cognition. This consistent phenotypic characteristic and the relative homogeneity of the WS genotype make WS a compelling human model for examining genotype–phenotype relations, especially with respect to social behavior. Following up on a recent report suggesting that individuals with WS do not show race bias and racial stereotyping, this study was designed to investigate the neural correlates of the perception of faces from different races, in individuals with WS as compared to typically developing (TD) controls. Caucasian WS and TD participants performed a gender identification task with own-race (White) and other-race (Black) faces while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. In line with previous studies with TD participants, other-race faces elicited larger amplitude ERPs within the first 200 ms following the face onset, in WS and TD participants alike. These results suggest that, just like their TD counterparts, individuals with WS differentially processed faces of own-race versus other-race, at relatively early stages of processing, starting as early as 115 ms after the face onset. Overall, these results indicate that neural processing of faces in individuals with WS is moderated by race at early perceptual stages, calling for a reconsideration of the previous claim that they are uniquely insensitive to race.

Abstract = {Eyewitnesses to events with multiple actors might be aware that during a subsequent investigation some actors will need to be remembered and others can be forgotten. Research on the directed-forgetting procedure suggests that when some information is cued to be forgotten, retention of other information is enhanced. In three experiments, directed-forgetting conditions were compared with control conditions to assess potential costs and benefits of forgetting other-race faces. In Experiment 1, undergraduate students (N = 148; mostly Caucasian) viewed all Black faces or all Asian faces followed by overt remember or forget cues. Participants in the directed-forgetting conditions of Experiments 2 and 3 received more covert cues instructing them to remember the faces of one race and to forget the faces of another race. In Experiment 2, undergraduate students (N = 116; all Caucasian) viewed Black and Asian faces within the context of a criminal storyline. In Experiment 3, undergraduate students (N = 94; all Caucasian) again viewed Black and Asian faces; however, the remember and forget cues were embedded in a noncriminal narrative. Although faces generally were forgotten on cue, forgetting some faces did not enhance memory for other faces. Furthermore, recognition of remember-cued faces was impaired by exposure to forget-cued faces. These findings indicate that faces can be forgotten on cue, but that doing so confers no benefit for remembering other faces. Eyewitnesses are advised that exposure to irrelevant faces reduces the likelihood that relevant faces will be remembered, even when effort is allocated to forgetting the irrelevant faces.

Abstract = {There is currently substantial literature to suggest that facial emotion recognition is impaired when other-race or inverted faces are presented. This study examined circumplex structures for recognising facial emotions under these conditions, directly measured those structures using a fractal dimension, and examined the difference between fractal dimensions. Results established that emotion ratings for the emotion prototypes used were sufficiently accurate under all conditions. Fractal analyses showed that the fractal dimensions of the circumplexes were significantly higher for recognition of facial emotions in other races than in one’s own when the faces were presented upright; the fractal dimensions of the circumplexes were also higher for recognition of emotions in inverted faces than in upright faces in the own-race condition. The results suggest that a lower level of facial emotion recognition is associated with higher fractal dimension and that an increase of fractal dimension may be characterised by lack of facial familiarity.

Abstract = {Perceivers remember own-race faces more accurately than other-race faces (i.e., Own-Race Bias). In the current experiments, we manipulated participants' attentional resources and social group membership to explore their influence on own and other-race face recognition memory. In Experiment 1, Chinese participants viewed own-race and Caucasian faces, and between-subjects we manipulated whether participants attention was divided during face encoding. We found that divided attention eliminated the Own-Race Bias in memory due to a reduction of memory accuracy for own-race faces, implicating that attention allocation plays a role in creating the bias. In Experiment 2, Chinese participants completed an ostensible personality test. Some participants were informed that their personality traits were most commonly found in Caucasian (i.e., other-race) individuals, resulting in these participants sharing a group membership with other-race targets. In contrast, other participants were not told anything about the personality test, resulting in the default own-race group membership. The participants encoded the faces for a subsequent recognition memory test either with or without performing a concurrent arithmetic distracting task. Results showed that other-race group membership and reducing attention during encoding independently eliminated the typical Own-Race Bias in face memory. The implications of these findings on perceptual-expertise and social-categorization models are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Learners demonstrate superior recognition of faces of their own race or ethnicity, compared to faces of other races or ethnicities; a finding termed the own-race bias. Accounts of the own-race bias differ on whether the effect reflects acquired expertise with own-race faces or enhanced motivation to individuate own-race faces. Learners have previously been motivated to demonstrate increased recall for highly important items through a value-based paradigm, in which item importance is designated using high (vs. low) point values. Learners receive point values by correctly recalling the corresponding items at test, and are given the goal of achieving a high total point score. In two experiments we examined whether a value-based paradigm can motivate learners to differentiate between other-race faces, reducing or eliminating the own-race bias. In Experiment 1, participants studied own- and other-race faces paired with high or low point values. High point values (12-point) indicated that face was highly important to learn, whereas low point values (1-point) indicated that face was less important to learn. Participants demonstrated increased recognition for high-value own-race (but not other-race) faces, suggesting that motivation alone is not enough to reduce the own-race bias. In Experiment 2, we examined whether participants could use value to enhance recognition when permitted to self-pace their study. Recognition did not differ between high-value own- and other-race faces, reducing the own-race bias. Such data suggest that motivation can influence the own-race bias when participants can control encoding. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The present study hypothesized that the magnitude of the other-race effect shall be reduced in individuals with ASD owing to their inattention to faces since infancy. Using a sequential face discrimination task, we tested the other-race effect of 18 ASD (mean age = 7.5 years) and 13 age-matched typically developing (TD) children (mean age = 7.6 years). The stimuli were cropped Asian and African faces, each with four levels of difficulty: easy (change identity), medium (replaced eyes), hard-eye (widen eye spacing), and hard-mouth (moved up mouth). The TD children showed a significant own-race advantage such that the best performance was found in the Asian easy condition. The ASD children did not exhibit such advantage at all. Moreover, ASD children showed the highest error rates in the hard-eye condition instead of the hard-mouth condition, indicating insensitivity to eyes region. In sum, our findings support the hypothesis that the other-race effect is reduced in ASD children, reflecting an incomplete development of an expert face system.

It also investigated the influence of area social factors (racial–ethnic neighborhood composition, and per capita income) and health service factors (presence of primary care clinics). The study sample included individuals admitted to a California hospital during 1990–2005 with a primary appendicitis related diagnosis, and without a prior or concurrent indication of schizophrenia. The adjusted logistic model examined how patient racial–ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Other), other personal, area social characteristics and presence of primary care clinics influenced hospital admissions for schizophrenia. Black individuals were almost twice as likely as Whites to be admitted while Hispanics and Other race individuals were less to be admitted. In addition, male sex, having more comorbidities and living in areas with greater proportions of non-Whites increased risk. The increased risk for Blacks compared to Whites was consistent with the existing literature. However, this is among the first studies to report that Hispanics had a reduced risk of admission for schizophrenia, compared to Whites. Future studies may want to include a broader range of health services to better understand patterns of care use among individuals with schizophrenia.

Abstract = {In a multi-phase research design over two academic semesters, White college students assigned to either a same-race or other-race roommate were tracked across two survey phases and a third phase involving an interracial interaction with a Black stranger. After four months, Whites who lived with an other-race roommate came to have more diverse friends and believe that diversity was more important than did Whites with a White roommate. After six months, self-reports, partner ratings, and nonverbal behavior indicated that Whites with an other-race roommate were less anxious, more pleasant, and more physically engaged during a novel interracial interaction. These results demonstrate that residential contact with other-race individuals not only affects race-related attitudes, but can also reduce interracial anxiety and positively influence behavior in subsequent diverse settings.

Abstract = {Processing faces is important for our adaptation in human society because perceiving others' thoughts and emotions through their faces are necessary for social communication and cooperation. Exploration into this issue provides a better understanding of the role of experience in the formation of visual processing expertise and the origin and establishment of racial prejudice and stereotypes. In this field, there is an effect confirmed by many research studies: the Other Race Effect (ORE). That is, individuals generally recognize own-race faces more accurately and faster than other-race faces. The existing behavioral and neural imaging studies have provided a great deal of insights into ORE, yet little is known about how individuals visually scan own- and other-race faces. Eye-tracking is one of the ideal methodologies for exploring this problem because it allows for recording the fixation of various observers on various parts of the face in real time with relatively high temporal and spatial resolution There have been several recent studies on ORE that have used the eye-tracking methodology. However, there exists a marked difference between the findings. Caldera, Kelly and their colleagues found that although Caucasian and Chinese adults use differently scanning strategies (the eye centric strategy by Caucasians and the nose centric strategy by Chinese), their scanning strategies for both own- and other race faces were the same. However, Fu and his colleagues (2011) found that the Chinese adults' scanning strategies used for own- and other race faces were different. It should be noted, participants used in the research studies of Caldera, Kelly and their colleagues, the Chinese participants are all studying abroad, they may have enough visual experience to affect their eye-movement model before they attend the experiments. In order to confirm Fu and his colleagues' results, and explore preschool children's face processing strategies for own and other race faces, we did a face-recognition research on native Chinese children aged from 4-7 years and native Chinese adults as controls. They had never had direct contact with other-race individuals. We first showed the participants a set of Chinese and Western Caucasian faces, instructing them to remember these "acquaintance". Then these photos will be mixed with other "no-acquaintance" photos in the following testing period. The participants should judge whether the photos were acquaintance one by one. We used a Tobii eye tracker to record the participants' fixations on the faces. The present results showed that: (I) Chinese participants (no matter preschool children or adults) were more inclined to scan the nose and mouth region of Chinese faces than that of Caucasian faces, and more inclined to scan the eye region of Caucasian faces than that of Chinese faces; (2) Adults showed more holistic perceptual strategies (scanning the nose region of the faces) than preschool children. The results confirmed Fu et al's finding and supported the expert-novice hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The neuropeptide Oxytocin influences a number of social behaviors, including processing of faces. We examined whether Oxytocin facilitates the processing of out-group faces and reduce the own-race bias (ORB). The ORB is a robust phenomenon characterized by poor recognition memory of other-race faces compared to the same-race faces. In Experiment 1, participants received intranasal solutions of Oxytocin or placebo prior to viewing White and Black faces. On a subsequent recognition test, whereas in the placebo condition the same-race faces were better recognized than other-race faces, in the Oxytocin condition Black and White faces were equally well recognized, effectively eliminating the ORB. In Experiment 2, Oxytocin was administered after the study phase. The ORB resulted, but Oxytocin did not significantly reduce the effect. This study is the first to show that Oxytocin can enhance face memory of out-group members and underscore the importance of social encoding mechanisms underlying the own-race bias.

Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests stronger holistic processing for own-race faces may underlie the own-race advantage in face memory. In previous studies Caucasian participants have demonstrated larger holistic processing effects for Caucasian over Asian faces. However, Asian participants have consistently shown similar sized effects for both Asian and Caucasian faces. We investigated two proposed explanations for the holistic processing of other-race faces by Asian participants: (1) greater other-race exposure, (2) a general global processing bias. Holistic processing was tested using the part-whole task. Participants were living in predominantly own-race environments and other-race contact was evaluated. Despite reporting significantly greater contact with own-race than other-race people, Chinese participants displayed strong holistic processing for both Asian and Caucasian upright faces. In addition, Chinese participants showed no evidence of holistic processing for inverted faces arguing against a general global processing bias explanation. Caucasian participants, in line with previous studies, displayed stronger holistic processing for Caucasian than Asian upright faces. For inverted faces there were no race-of-face differences. These results are used to suggest that Asians may make more general use of face-specific mechanisms than Caucasians. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The other-race effect (ORE) refers to the phenomenon that we can discriminate own-race faces better than other-race faces. The present study aims to explore the face processing ability for own-race and other-race faces in Taiwanese infants aged between 4 and 9 months when the visual system is still maturing. The stimuli contained faces of three ethnic groups (Asian, Caucasian, and African). In each race, the face discrimination task had three levels of difficulty (Easy, Median, and Hard). The visual paired-comparison (VPC) task was used to assess 4-, 6-, and 9-month-old infants’ discriminability for the familiar/novel faces via recording infant’s looking time. Comparable 3-alternative forced-choice procedure was used in the adult experiment except that an additional “identical” condition was added. The results showed that 4-month olds can only discriminate Asian “easy” faces. 6-month olds can discriminate “easy” faces of all three ethnic groups. 9-month olds can further discriminate “median” Asian and Caucasian faces but not African “median” faces. For adults, the accuracy decreased and response time increased as the stimulus difficulty increased, indicating the validity of the stimulus difficulty. In conclusion, own-race advantage emerges around 4 months of age, while ORE may take place between 6 and 9 months as the discriminability for African faces does not improve. Taken together, these findings suggest a mixture of general improvement in face processing ability as well as a specific tuning by the own-race experience.

Abstract = {We investigated the impact of ingroup/outgroup categorization on the encoding of same-race and other-race faces presented in inter-racial and intra-racial contexts (Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). White participants performed a same/different matching task on pairs of upright and inverted faces that were either same-race (White) or other-race (Black), and labeled as being from the same university or a different university. In Experiment 1, the same- and other-race faces were intermixed. For other-race faces, participants demonstrated greater configural processing following same- than other-university labeling. Same-race faces showed strong configural coding irrespective of the university labeling. In Experiment 2, faces were blocked by race. Participants demonstrated greater configural processing of same- than other-university faces, but now for both same- and other-race faces. These results demonstrate that other-race face processing is sensitive to non-racial ingroup/outgroup status regardless of racial context, but that the sensitivity of same-race face processing to the same cues depends on the racial context in which targets are encountered.

Abstract = {Over the last decade, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has seen a significant increase in the number of discrimination claims based on skin shade. However, in some ways, substantiating colorism has proven to be more difficult than documenting racism, as skin tone data are rarely collected and few existing skin tone measures have been validated. The present study examines an increasingly popular skin tone scale that includes a professionally designed color guide to enhance rater consistency. Logistic regression analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and General Social Survey indicates that despite the addition of the color guide, the race of the interviewer matters for the assessment of respondent skin tone. On average, African American respondents with a white interviewer were about 3 times more likely to be classified as dark than those with an African American interviewer. We argue that failing to appropriately account for this race-of-interviewer effect can significantly impact colorism findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

An online survey of sexual behavior was completed by Black, White, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, and other-race MSM (n = 11,766) ages 18–87 years. Complete condom use, semen exposure, pre-coital rectal douching (enema use), and lubricant use at last male-partnered sexual event were compared by race, controlling for relevant sociodemographic variables and stratifying by sexual position (receptive, insertive, or both). Across sexual positions, 55–62% of Black MSM reported condom use, 5–8% reported semen exposure, 18–53% reported douching, and 33–43% reported lubricant use. Reported behavioral profiles were not significantly different from other races, except that Black MSM reported greater condom use than White MSM in the insertive position. Although findings argue against disproportionate rates of risk behavior accounting for racial disparities in HIV prevalence, they nonetheless highlight a need for continued behavioral intervention.

Abstract = {Humans show an "other-race effect" for face recognition, with more accurate recognition of own- versus other-race faces. We compared the neural representations of own- and other-race faces using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in combination with a multi-voxel pattern classifier. Neural activity was recorded while Asians and Caucasians viewed Asian and Caucasian faces. A pattern classifier, applied to voxels across a broad range of ventral temporal areas, discriminated the brain activity maps elicited in response to Asian versus Caucasian faces in the brains of both Asians and Caucasians. Classification was most accurate in the first few time points of the block and required the use of own-race faces in the localizer scan to select voxels for classifier input. Next, we examined differences in the time-course of neural responses to own- and other-race faces and found evidence for a temporal "other-race effect." Own-race faces elicited a larger neural response initially that attenuated rapidly. The response to other-race faces was weaker at first, but increased over time, ultimately surpassing the magnitude of the own-race response in the fusiform "face" area (FFA). A similar temporal response pattern held across a broad range of ventral temporal areas. The pattern-classification results indicate the early availability of categorical information about own- versus other-race face status in the spatial pattern of neural activity. The slower, more sustained, brain response to other-race faces may indicate the need to recruit additional neural resources to process other-race faces for identification.

Abstract = {On the eve of the centennial of the abolition of slavery in the United States, James Baldwin (1963) offered the following counsel to his nephew: “You can only be destroyed by believing that you really are what the white world calls a nigger. I tell you this because I love you, and please don’t you ever forget it” (p. 18). To follow such advice is not easy in the present, but it was even more challenging in the era of Jim Crow segregation in which anti-Black discourses emanated from almost every corner of White America. Baldwin, however, was no utopian. Black men and women could avoid such a fate because a vibrant Black counterpublic sphere existed—Nancy Fraser’s (1990) word for the political space where “subordinated social groups invent and circulate counter-discourses” and “formulate oppositional interpretations of their needs, identities and interests” (pp. 56–80). Over the centuries, Black churches, songs, schools, abolitionists, poets, journalists, activists, artists, educators, and essayists had managed to forge a Black country against great odds (Singh, 2005). In this world, one heard a different story about nation, Blackness, and Whiteness. Here Blackness was celebrated rather than pathologized, Whites criticized and pitied, racism named and discussed, and American myths of fairness, individualism, exceptionalism, and freedom conditionalized, if not exploded. Fifty years hence, it should be obvious to most that the liberation of the United States, and not just Black America, requires building on and universalizing the Black counterpublics that have allowed so many to escape self-destruction. Yet as the United States, or at least White America, has moved from essentialist racism (i.e., race as a marker of ontological or biological difference) toward racial color blindness (i.e., race as a marker of racism and thus something that should be overlooked), these counterpublics have been attacked rather than nurtured. This is largely because Black counterpublics practice color consciousness. For example, within these arenas, it is viewed as racist if one does not see race and the difference that it makes in people’s lives. The racially color-blind code of conduct, in contrast, values avoiding or attempting to overlook race. Thus, from the vantage of racially color-blind America, these counterpublics should be reduced, if not eradicated, if racial progress is to be had. This built-in antipathy toward Black and other race-cognizant counterpublics is one of the central reasons critical race scholars have targeted racial color blindness for change. An understanding of race in Brazil, as I detail here, helps greatly to advance this project of undoing racial color blindness and building color consciousness in the United States.

It is possible, however, that they reflect the relative visual novelty of other-race faces. Here we demonstrate an attentional bias to other-race faces in the absence of perceived threat.

Nevertheless, using a new dot-probe paradigm that can distinguish attentional capture and hold effects, we found that these other-race faces selectively captured visual attention. Importantly, this demonstration challenges previous interpretations of attentional biases to other-race faces as threat responses.

Abstract = {Faces convey a variety of socially relevant cues that have been shown to affect recognition, such as age, sex, and race, but few studies have examined the interactive effect of these cues. White participants of two distinct age groups were presented with faces that differed in race, age, and sex in a face recognition paradigm. Replicating the other-race effect, young participants recognized young own-race faces better than young other-race faces. However, recognition performance did not differ across old faces of different races (Experiments 1, 2A). In addition, participants showed an other-age effect, recognizing White young faces better than White old faces. Sex affected recognition performance only when age was not varied (Experiment 2B). Overall, older participants showed a similar recognition pattern (Experiment 3) as young participants, displaying an other-race effect for young, but not old, faces. However, they recognized young and old White faces on a similar level. These findings indicate that face cues interact to affect recognition performance such that age and sex information reliably modulate the effect of race cues. These results extend accounts of face recognition that explain recognition biases (such as the other-race effect) as a function of dichotomous ingroup/outgroup categorization, in that outgroup characteristics are not simply additive but interactively determine recognition performance.

Abstract = {It is well established that individuals show an other-race effect (ORE) in face recognition: they recognize own-race faces better than other-race faces. The present study tested the hypothesis that individuals would also scan own- and other-race faces differently. We asked Chinese participants to remember Chinese and Caucasian faces and we tested their memory of the faces over five testing blocks. The participants' eye movements were recorded with the use of an eye tracker. The data were analyzed with an Area of Interest approach using the key AOIs of a face (eyes, nose, and mouth). Also, we used the iMap toolbox to analyze the raw data of participants' fixation on each pixel of the entire face. Results from both types of analyses strongly supported the hypothesis. When viewing target Chinese or Caucasian faces, Chinese participants spent a significantly greater proportion of fixation time on the eyes of other-race Caucasian faces than the eyes of own-race Chinese faces. In contrast, they spent a significantly greater proportion of fixation time on the nose and mouth of Chinese faces than the nose and mouth of Caucasian faces. This pattern of differential fixation, for own- and other-race eyes and nose in particular, was consistent even as participants became increasingly familiar with the target faces of both races. The results could not be explained by the perceptual salience of the Chinese nose or Caucasian eyes because these features were not differentially salient across the races. Our results are discussed in terms of the facial morphological differences between Chinese and Caucasian faces and the enculturation of mutual gaze norms in East Asian cultures.

Abstract = {Same-race (SR) faces are recognized better than other-race (OR) faces, and this other-race effect (ORE) is correlated with experience. SR faces are also processed more holistically than OR faces, suggesting one possible mechanism for poorer performance on OR faces. Studies of object expertise have shown that individuating experiences are necessary for holistic processing to develop; yet thus far no studies have investigated the role of quality of experience and the ORE for holistic processing. In the present study, we found a strong negative correlation between a self-report of individuating experience and the ORE in holistic processing in both Caucasian and Black participants, indicating that the more individuating experience a person has, the less ORE in holistic processing. This confirms the critical role of individuating experience in development of holistic processing for faces and suggests that quality of experience is a key determinant of the manner in which OR faces are processed.

If both cues equally facilitate search, a symmetrical interaction would be predicted; anger cues should facilitate detection of other race faces and cues of other race membership should facilitate detection of anger. Past research investigating this race by emotional expression interaction in categorisation tasks revealed an asymmetrical interaction. This suggests that cues of other race membership may facilitate the detection of angry faces but not vice versa. Utilising the same stimuli and procedures across two search tasks, participants were asked to search for targets defined by either race or emotional expression. Contrary to the results revealed in the categorisation paradigm, cues of anger facilitated detection of other race faces whereas differences in race did not differentially influence detection of emotion targets.

Abstract = {Fixation duration for same-race (i.e., Asian) and other-race (i.e., Caucasian) female faces by Asian infant participants between 4 and 9months of age was investigated with an eye-tracking procedure. The age range tested corresponded with prior reports of processing differences between same- and other-race faces observed in behavioral looking time studies, with preference for same-race faces apparent at 3months of age and recognition memory differences in favor of same-race faces emerging between 3 and 9months of age. The eye-tracking results revealed both similarity and difference in infants’ processing of own- and other-race faces. There was no overall fixation time difference between same race and other race for the whole face stimuli. In addition, although fixation time was greater for the upper half of the face than for the lower half of the face and trended higher on the right side of the face than on the left side of the face, face race did not impact these effects. However, over the age range tested, there was a gradual decrement in fixation time on the internal features of other-race faces and a maintenance of fixation time on the internal features of same-race faces. Moreover, the decrement in fixation time for the internal features of other-race faces was most prominent on the nose. The findings suggest that (a) same-race preferences may be more readily evidenced in paired comparison testing formats, (b) the behavioral decline in recognition memory for other-race faces corresponds in timing with a decline in fixation on the internal features of other-race faces, and (c) the center of the face (i.e., the nose) is a differential region for processing same- versus other-race faces by Asian infants.

Abstract = {This longitudinal study assessed 133 Caucasian German infants at 3 and 6 months of age to investigate the influence of own-race and other-race faces as visual stimuli on association learning in the visual expectation paradigm (VExP). The study is related to the findings on the other-race-effect (ORE) which is said to emerge at 6 months of age. Caucasian faces were used as stimuli of a familiar ethnic category, whereas African faces were used as stimuli of an unfamiliar ethnic category. There was no significant difference between the two stimulus classes in infants’ reaction time (RT) to stimulus shifts at 3 months. At 6 months of age, infants’ RT decreased significantly in the Caucasian faces condition but not in the African faces condition. These results indicate that the processing of other-race versus own-race faces by the age of 6 months, which is also the relevant age for the onset of the ORE, has an important influence on the performance on the VExP.

Abstract = {It has been suggested that differential use of configural processing strategies may underlie racially based recognition deficits (known as the “other-race effect”). By employing a well-known configural manipulation (Thatcherization, i.e., rotating the eyes and mouth by 180°), we aimed to demonstrate, electrophysiologically, that configural processing is used to a greater extent when viewing same-race faces than when viewing other-race faces. Face-related event-related potential (ERP) responses were measured for participants viewing normal and Thatcherized faces of their own race (Caucasian) and of another race (African-American). The P1 and N170 components were modulated to a greater extent by Thatcherization for same-race faces, suggesting that the processing of these faces is, in fact, more reliant on configural information than other-race faces. Thatcherization also affected the P250 component more so for same-race faces independently of orientation. The race-dependent effects of Thatcherization as early as P1 suggest that configural encoding may be occurring much earlier than the well-cited N170.

Abstract = {The present study was the first to use the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology to investigate the neural correlates of race categorization of own- and other-race faces. We found that Chinese participants categorized the race of Caucasian faces more accurately and faster than that of Chinese faces, replicating the robust effect of the other-race categorization advantage. Regions of interest (ROI) analyses revealed greater neural activations when participants were categorizing own-race faces than other-race faces in the bilateral ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT) such as the fusiform face areas (FFAs) and the occipital face areas (OFAs). Within the left FFA, there was also a significant negative correlation between the behavioral difference of own- and other-race face categorization accuracy and the activation difference between categorizing own- and other-race faces. Whole brain analyses showed that categorizing own-race faces induced greater activations in the right medial frontal cortex (MFC) and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) than categorizing other-race faces. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed that the frontal cortical regions interacted more strongly with the posterior VOT during the categorization of own-race faces than that of other-race faces. Overall, our findings suggest that relative to the categorization of other-race faces, more cortical resources are engaged during the categorization of own-race faces with which we have a higher level of processing expertise. This increased involvement of cortical neural sources perhaps serves to provide more in-depth processing of own-race faces (such as individuation), which in turn paradoxically results in the behavioral other-race categorization advantage.

Abstract = {People often recognize same-race faces better than other-race faces. This cross-race effect (CRE) has been proposed to arise in part because learners devote fewer cognitive resources to encode faces of social out-groups. In three experiments, we evaluated whether learners’ other-race mnemonic deficits are due to “cognitive disregard” during study and whether this disregard is under metacognitive control. Learners studied each face either for as long as they wanted (the self-paced condition) or for the average time taken by a self-paced learner (the fixed-rate condition). Self-paced learners allocated equal amounts of study time to same-race and other-race faces, and having control over study time did not change the size of the CRE. In the second and third experiments, both self-paced and fixed-rate learners were given instructions to “individuate” other-race faces. Individuation instructions caused self-paced learners to allocate more study time to other-race faces, but this did not significantly reduce the size of the CRE, even for learners who reported extensive contact with other races. We propose that the differential processing that people apply to faces of different races and the subsequent other-race mnemonic deficit are not due to learners’ strategic cognitive disregard of other-race faces.

Abstract = {Prior work on own-race bias in visual face recognition has considered cognitive and social-cognitive explanations to account for the more efficient recognition of own-race faces as compared to faces of models from other races. One perceptual account with reasonable support suggests that the pattern reflects a cognitive tendency away from holistic processing of other-race faces. The present study engaged participants in an orientation task that provoked either global (holistic) or local (feature) processing prior to a face recognition task. Response latencies suggested that inducing a global processing bias slowed recognition of other-race faces relative to that of own-race faces, whereas inducing a local processing bias led to nearly equal face recognition times for both categories of faces. Furthermore, processing of other-race faces was slower with a global rather than a local processing bias. Results provide converging evidence that own-race faces and other-race faces differ in global analysis received. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Previous research suggests that the own-race bias (ORB) in memory for faces is a result of other-race faces receiving less visual attention at encoding. As women typically display an own-gender bias in memory for faces and men do not, we investigated whether face gender and sex of viewer influenced visual attention and memory for own- and other-race faces, and if preferential viewing of own-race faces contributed to the ORB in memory. Participants viewed pairs of female or male own- and other-race faces while their viewing time was recorded. Afterwards, they completed a surprise memory test. We found that (1) other-race males received the initial focus of attention, (2) own-race faces were viewed longer than other-race faces over time, although the difference was larger for female faces, and (3) even though longer viewing time increased the probability of remembering a face, it did not explain the magnified ORB in memory for female faces. Importantly, these findings highlight that face gender moderates attentional responses to and memory for own- and other-race faces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {People are generally better at recognizing faces from their own race than from a different race, as has been shown in numerous behavioral studies. Here we use event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how differences between own-race and other-race faces influence the neural correlates of memory encoding and recognition. ERPs of Asian and Caucasian participants were recorded during the study and test phases of a Remember–Know paradigm with Chinese and Caucasian faces. A behavioral other-race effect was apparent in both groups, neither of which recognized other-race faces as well as own-race faces; however, Caucasian subjects showed stronger behavioral other-race effects. In the study phase, memory encoding was assessed with the ERP difference due to memory (Dm). Other-race effects in memory encoding were only found for Caucasian subjects. For subsequently “recollected” items, Caucasian subjects showed less positive mean amplitudes for own-race than other-race faces indicating that less neural activation was required for successful memory encoding of own-race faces. For the comparison of subsequently “recollected” and “familiar” items, Caucasian subjects showed similar brain activation only for own-race faces suggesting that subsequent familiarity and recollection of own-race faces arose from similar memory encoding processes. Experience with a race also influenced old/new effects, which are ERP correlates of recollection measured during recognition testing. Own-race faces elicited a typical parietal old/new effect, whereas old/new effects for other-race faces were prolonged and dominated by activity in frontal brain regions, suggesting a stronger involvement of post-retrieval monitoring processes. These results indicate that the other-race effect is a memory encoding- and recognition-based phenomenon. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Memory is often less accurate for faces from another racial group than for faces from one’s own racial group. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are a topic of active debate. Contemporary theories invoke factors such as inferior expertise with faces from other racial groups and an encoding emphasis on race-specifying information. We investigated neural mechanisms of this memory bias by recording event-related potentials while participants attempted to memorize same-race (SR) and other-race (OR) faces. Brain potentials at encoding were compared as a function of successful versus unsuccessful recognition on a subsequent-memory test. Late positive amplitudes predicted subsequent memory for SR faces and, to a lesser extent, for OR faces. By contrast, the amplitudes of earlier frontocentral N200 potentials and occipito-temporal P2 potentials were larger for later-remembered relative to later-forgotten OR faces. Furthermore, N200 and P2 amplitudes were larger for OR faces with features considered atypical of that race relative to faces that were race-stereotypical (according to a consensus from a large group of other participants). In keeping with previous reports, we infer that these earlier potentials index the processing of unique or individuating facial information, which is key to remembering a face. Individuation may tend to be uniformly high for SR faces but lower and less reliable for OR faces. Individuation may also be more readily applied for OR faces that appear less stereotypical. These electrophysiological measures thus provide novel evidence that poorer memory for OR faces stems from encoding that is inadequate because it fails to emphasize individuating information.

In addition, ASD and TD groups responded similarly to stimulus manipulations (use of identical or different photographs for identity matching and cropping stimuli to remove hair information). However, age-standardized scores varied widely within the ASD sample, and a subgroup of ASD participants with impaired face recognition did not exhibit a significant own-race recognition advantage.

Abstract = {Faces of one’s own race are discriminated and recognized more accurately than faces of an other race (other-race effect–ORE). Studies have employed several methods to enhance individuation and recognition of other-race faces and reduce the ORE, including intensive perceptual training with other-race faces and explicitly instructing participants to individuate other-race faces. Unfortunately, intensive perceptual training has shown to be specific to the race trained and the use of explicit individuation strategies, though applicable to all races, can be demanding of attention and difficult to consistently employ. It has not yet been demonstrated that a training procedure can foster the automatic individuation of all other-race faces, not just faces from the race trained. Anecdotal evidence from a training procedure used with developmental prosopagnosics (DPs) in our lab, individuals with lifelong face recognition impairments, suggests that this may be possible. To further test this idea, we had five Caucasian DPs perform ten days of configural face training (i.e. attending to small spacing differences between facial features) with own-race (Caucasian) faces to see if training would generalize to improvements with other-race (Korean) faces. To assess training effects and localize potential effects to parts-based or holistic processing, we used the part-whole task using Caucasian and Korean faces (Tanaka, J. W., Kiefer, M., & Bukach, C. M. (2004). A holistic account of the own-race effect in face recognition: evidence from a cross-cultural study. Cognition, 93(1), B1–9). Results demonstrated that after training, DPs showed a disproportionate improvement in holistic processing of other-race faces compared to own-race faces, reducing their ORE. This suggests that configural training with own-race faces boosted DPs’ general configural/holistic attentional resources, which they were able to apply to other-race faces. This provides a novel method to reduce the ORE and supports more of an attentional/social-cognitive model of the ORE rather than a strictly expertise model.

Abstract = {The other-race effect (ORE), or the finding that same-race faces are better recognized than other-race faces, is one of the best replicated phenomena in face recognition. The current article reviews existing evidence and theory and proposes a new theoretical framework for the ORE, which argues that the effect results from a confluence of social categorization, motivated individuation, and perceptual experience. This categorization-individuation model offers not only a parsimonious account of both classic and recent evidence for category-based biases in face recognition but also links the ORE to broader evidence and theory in social cognition and face perception. Finally, the categorization-individuation model makes a series of novel predictions for how the ORE can be exacerbated, attenuated, or even eliminated via perceptual and motivational processes, both by improving other-race recognition and by reducing same-race recognition. The authors propose that this new model for the ORE also leads to applied interventions that differ sharply from other theories of the ORE, while simultaneously providing an integrative theoretical framework for future research on the ORE.

Yet, new research has shown that these ostensibly automatic biases may not be as inevitable as once thought and that motivational influences may be able to eliminate these biases. It is unclear, however, whether motivational influences shape the initial biases or whether these biases can only be modulated by later, controlled processes. Using EEG to examine the time course of biased processing, we manipulated approach and avoidance motivational states by having participants pull or push a joystick, respectively, while viewing White or Black faces. Consistent with previous work on own-race bias, we observed a greater P100 response to White than Black faces; however, this racial bias was attenuated in the approach condition. These data suggest that rapid social perception may be flexible and can be modulated by motivational states. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In an experimental study, we assessed the role of motion when encoding and recognizing unfamiliar faces, using an old/new recognition memory paradigm. Our findings revealed a clear advantage for learning unfamiliar faces moving non-rigidly, compared with static faces. This advantage for motion was found with both same- and other-race faces. Furthermore, results indicate that it is more important that the face is learnt in motion than recognized from a moving clip. Interestingly, despite a reliable other-race effect being revealed, participants were able to utilize motion information exhibited by other-race faces in a manner akin to the motion advantage found for same-race faces. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the nature of the stored face representations, considering whether the facilitative role found here can be explained by factors other than motion per se.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by H. D. Lucas, J. Y. Chiao and K. A. Paller (see record [rid]2011-06714-001[/rid]). The authors found that people fail to recognize outgroup members because they are insensitive to the individual features of their faces, features that would otherwise aid in the discrimination of group members. They conducted an experiment comprised of two critical phases. In phase one, participants studied faces that were either ingroup, same-race (SR) faces, or outgroup, OR faces. During phase two, recognition was tested through presentation of old, studied faces, and new, unstudied faces. Memory was greater for SR faces compared with OR faces, replicating the other-race effect (ORE). The authors' research intimates that there may exist foundational processes that support individuation within milliseconds of viewing an individual. These results likely extend beyond racial-group membership; recent evidence indicates that recognition deficits are found for members of outgroups independent of race. Thus, the authors contribute to the growing literature on how memory differences for individuals of ORs are shaped by social and perceptual factors during neural processing.

Abstract = {Viewers are typically better at remembering faces from their own race than from other races; however, it is not yet established whether this effect is due to memorial or perceptual processes. In this study, UK and Egyptian viewers were given a simultaneous face-matching task, in which the target faces were presented upright or upside down. As with previous research using face memory tasks, participants were worse at matching other-race faces than own-race faces and showed a stronger face inversion effect for own-race faces. However, subjects’ performance on own and other-race faces was highly correlated. These data provide strong evidence that difficulty in perceptual encoding of unfamiliar faces contributes substantially to the other-race effect and that accounts based entirely on memory cannot capture the full data. Implications for forensic settings are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The ‘other-race’ effect describes the phenomenon in which faces are difficult to distinguish from one another if they belong to an ethnic or racial group to which the observer has had little exposure. Adult observers typically display multiple forms of recognition error for other-race faces, and infants exhibit behavioral evidence of a developing other-race effect at about 9 months of age. The neural correlates of the adult other-race effect have been identified using ERPs and fMRI, but the effects of racial category on infants’ neural response to face stimuli have to date not been described. We examine two distinct components of the infant ERP response to human faces and demonstrate through the use of computer-generated ‘hybrid’ faces that the observed other-race effect is not the result of low-level sensitivity to 3D shape and color differences between the stimuli. Rather, differential processing depends critically on the joint encoding of race-specific features. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Psychological research indicates that humans recognize faces of their own race more accurately than faces of other races. This "other-race effect" occurs for algorithms tested in a recent international competition for state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms. We report results for a Western algorithm made by fusing eight algorithms from Western countries and an East Asian algorithm made by fusing five algorithms from East Asian countries. At the low false accept rates required for most security applications, the Western algorithm recognized Caucasian faces more accurately than East Asian faces and the East Asian algorithm recognized East Asian faces more accurately than Caucasian faces. Next, using a test that spanned all false alarm rates, we compared the algorithms with humans of Caucasian and East Asian descent matching face identity in an identical stimulus set. In this case, both algorithms performed better on the Caucasian faces—the "majority" race in the database. The Caucasian face advantage, however, was far larger for the Western algorithm than for the East Asian algorithm. Humans showed the standard other-race effect for these faces, but showed more stable performance than the algorithms over changes in the race of the test faces. State-of-the-art face recognition algorithms, like humans, struggle with "other-race face" recognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Other-race faces are generally recognized more poorly than own-race faces. According to Levin's influential race-coding hypothesis, this other-race recognition deficit results from spontaneous coding of race-specifying information, at the expense of individuating information, in other-race faces. Therefore, requiring participants to code race-specifying information for all faces should eliminate the other-race effect by reducing recognition of own-race faces to the level of other race faces. We tested this prediction in two experiments. Race coding was induced by requiring participants to rate study faces on race typicality (experiment 1) or to categorize them by race (experiment 2). Neither manipulation reduced the other-race effect, providing no support for the race-coding hypothesis. Instead, race-coding instructions marginally increased the other-race effect in experiment 1 and had no effect in experiment 2. These results do not support the race-coding hypothesis. Surprisingly, a control task of rating the attractiveness of study faces increased the other-race effect, indicating that deeper encoding of faces does not necessarily reduce the effect (experiment 1). Finally, the normally robust other-race effect was absent when participants were instructed to individuate other-race faces (experiment 2). We suggest that poorer recognition of other-race faces may reflect reduced perceptual expertise with such faces and perhaps reduced motivation to individuate them.

Abstract = {Known as the cross-race effect (CRE), psychological research has consistently shown that people are less accurate at identifying faces of another, less familiar race. While the CRE has most often been demonstrated in recognition memory, its effects have also been found in temporally preceding social-cognitive stages—including racial categorization, perceptual discrimination, and higher-level cognitive processing. Using path models of own- and other-race face processing, the current study sought to estimate how temporally preceding processes might mediate the CRE established in recognition memory. Results demonstrated that racial categorization and higher-level cognitive processes primarily mediate the CRE in recognition memory, and that the degree of interracial contact moderated the incidence of repetition errors on other-race faces.

Abstract = {Human beings are remarkably skilled at recognizing faces, with the marked exception of other-race faces: the so-called “other-race effect.” As reported nearly a century ago [Feingold CA (1914) Journal of Criminal Law and Police Science 5:39–51], this face-recognition impairment is accompanied by the popular belief that other-race faces all look alike. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this high-level “perceptual illusion” are still unknown. To address this question, we recorded high-resolution electrophysiological scalp signals from East Asian (EA) and Western Caucasian (WC) observers as they viewed two EA or WC faces. The first adaptor face was followed by a target face of either the same or different identity. We quantified repetition suppression (RS), a reduction in neural activity in stimulus-sensitive regions following stimulus repetition. Conventional electrophysiological analyses on target faces failed to reveal any RS effect. However, to fully account for the paired nature of RS events, we subtracted the signal elicited by target to adaptor faces for each single trial and performed unbiased spatiotemporal data-driven analyses. This unique approach revealed stronger RS to same-race faces of same identity in both groups of observers on the face-sensitive N170 component. Such neurophysiological modulation in RS suggests efficient identity coding for same-race faces. Strikingly, OR faces elicited identical RS regardless of identity, all looking alike to the neural population underlying the N170. Our data show that sensitivity to race begins early at the perceptual level, providing, after nearly 100 y of investigations, a neurophysiological correlate of the “all look alike” perceptual experience.

Abstract = {The graduation of high school students is a major priority of our education system. Achieving the minimal proficiency of a high school diploma is critical for entering the labor market, as well as for developing specialized careers through higher post secondary education. Standards of high school graduation performance that were acceptable in the past decades no longer apply. Many students are still dropping out of high school. Within some communities the proportion of students dropping out of high school before graduation is alarmingly high. These communities face a continuing pattern of low education levels since parents' educational attainment directly influences the next generation's academic achievements. Besides addressing the overall issues of the quality and quantity of the delivery of education services, individual communities can work with their members to adjust community culture and lifestyles to encourage high school retention. Population data on high school dropout statistics when collected are very limited to racial affirmative action categories. Data stratified by ethnic class within these racial categories are not available. In order to estimate the dropout rates within a particular ethnic population, a mathematical model was developed by the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute using census data and New York City Board of Education dropout statistics. The Calandra Model was initially applied to estimate Italian-American high school dropout rates as compared to the other race/ethnic populations. This study reports on the distinction between the high school dropout patterns of Italian-American students compared to other race/ethnic groups.

Abstract = {The processing of other-race faces has been suggested to differ from own-race face processing with regard to the extent to which configural and/or holistic information is taken into account. We aimed at investigating the underlying mechanisms more precisely by applying event-related potentials (ERP). We presented upright and inverted own-race, other-race, and other-species faces (apes), as well as nonfacial control stimuli (houses), and analysed the effects of stimulus type and inversion on the N170. Peak latencies for same-race, other-race, other-species, and non-face stimuli gradually increased, and inversion of all types of face stimuli led to an additional delay. Importantly, the two factors did not interact for face stimuli. Inversion increased N170 amplitudes for own- and other-race faces only. We conclude that early perceptual mechanisms of face processing are not qualitatively different for own and other-race faces. Instead, the same underlying processes appear to work less efficiently for other-race faces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Previous research suggests specific deficits in face perception and memory in older adults, which could reflect a dedifferentiation in the context of a general broadening of cognitive architecture with advanced age. Such dedifferentiation could manifest in a less specialized face processing system. A promising tool to investigate the fine-tuning of face processing in older age is the own-race bias (ORB), a phenomenon reflecting more accurate memory for own-relative to other-race faces, which is related to an expertise-based specialization of early perceptual stages. To investigate whether poor face memory in older age is accompanied by reduced expertise-based specialization of face processing, we assessed event-related brain potential correlates of the ORB in high- vs. low-performing older adults (mean age = 69 years; N = 24 per group). Intriguingly, both older groups demonstrated an equivalent pattern of a behavioral ORB, and a parallel increase in N170 for other-race faces, reflecting less efficient early perceptual processing for this face category. Group differences only emerged independent of face ethnicity: whereas low-performers exhibited a right-lateralized N170, high-performers showed a more bilateral response. This finding may suggest a compensatory mechanism counteracting age-related decline in face perception enabling more efficient encoding into memory in high performers. Overall, our results demonstrate that even a less efficient face processing system in older adults can exhibit preserved expertise-related specialization toward own-race faces.

Abstract = {We investigated how visual experience with faces of a particular race affects subordinate group-level categorizations in Chinese and Israeli participants living in the respective countries. Categorization of faces by race, gender, and age was examined within subjects with participants who had only minimal experience with the other-race faces. As would be predicted by the previously documented other-race advantage effect, both Chinese and Israeli participants classified the race of the face more quickly and more accurately for other-race than for own-race faces. In contrast, the observers' race did not interact with the race of the rated face either for gender or for age categorization. The absence of these interactions suggests that the physiognomic characteristics that determine the gender and age of a face are universal, rather than race specific. Furthermore, these data suggest that determining the race of a face is not imposed as a first step in face processing, preempting the perception of other category-defining physiognomic characteristics.

Abstract = {Participants are more accurate at remembering faces of their own relative to another ethnic group (own-race bias, ORB). This phenomenon has been explained by reduced perceptual expertise, or alternatively, by the categorization of other-race faces into social outgroups and reduced effort to individuate such faces. We examined event-related potential (ERP) correlates of the ORB, testing recognition memory for Asian and Caucasian faces in Caucasian and Asian participants. Both groups demonstrated a significant ORB in recognition memory. ERPs revealed more negative N170 amplitudes for other-race faces in both groups, probably reflecting more effortful structural encoding. Importantly, the ethnicity effect in left-hemispheric N170 during learning correlated significantly with the behavioral ORB. Similarly, in the subsequent N250, both groups demonstrated more negative amplitudes for other-race faces, and during test phases, this effect correlated significantly with the ORB. We suggest that ethnicity effects in the N170 reflect an early categorization of other-race faces into a social out-group, resulting in less efficient encoding and thus decreased memory. Moreover, ethnicity effects in the N250 may represent the “tagging” of other-race faces as perceptually salient, which hampers the recognition of these faces.

Unlike previous studies that reported an own-race advantage after administering a single test of either holistic processing or of featural and relational processing, we used a cross-over design and multiple tasks to assess differential processing of faces from a familiar race versus a less familiar race. Caucasian and Chinese adults performed four tasks, each with Caucasian and Chinese faces. Two tasks measured holistic processing: the composite face task and the part/whole task. Both tasks indicated holistic processing of own-race and other-race faces that did not differ in degree. Two tasks measured featural and relational processing: the Jane/Ling task, in which same/different judgments were made about face pairs that differed in features of their spacing, and the scrambled/blurred task, in which test faces were scrambled (isolates memory for components) or blurred (isolates memory for relations). Both tasks provided evidence of an own-race advantage in both featural and relational processing. We conclude that even when adults process other-race faces holistically, other manifestations of an own-race advantage remain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

However, employing a variable mapping of face pictures one recent report found preferential detection of own-race faces vs. other-race faces (Lipp et al., 2009). Using the well-controlled design and a heterogeneous set of real face images, in the present study we explored the visual search for own and other race faces in Chinese and Caucasian participants. Across both groups, the search for a face of one race among other-race faces was serial and self-terminating. In Chinese participants, the search consistently faster for other-race than own-race faces, irrespective of upright or upside-down condition; however, this search asymmetry was not evident in Caucasian participants. These characteristics suggested that the race of a face is not a visual basic feature, and in Chinese participants the faster search for other-race than own-race faces also reflects perceptual factors.

Abstract = {Abstract facial cues of racial outgroup or anger mediate fear learning that is resistant to extinction. Whether this resistance is potentiated if fear is conditioned to angry, other race faces has not been established. Two groups of Caucasian participants were conditioned with two happy and two angry face conditional stimuli (CSs). During acquisition, one happy and one angry face were paired with an aversive unconditional stimulus whereas the second happy and angry faces were presented alone. CS face race (Caucasian, African American) was varied between groups. During habituation, electrodermal responses were larger to angry faces regardless of race and declined less to other race faces. Extinction was immediate for Caucasian happy faces, delayed for angry faces regardless of race, and slowest for happy racial outgroup faces. Combining the facial cues of other race and anger does not enhance resistance to extinction of fear. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Recent advances in social neuroscience research have unveiled the neurophysiological correlates of race and intergroup processing. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying intergroup empathy. Combining event‐related fMRI with measurements of pupil dilation as an index of autonomic reactivity, we explored how race and group membership affect empathy‐related responses. White and Black subjects were presented with video clips depicting white, black, and unfamiliar violet‐skinned hands being either painfully penetrated by a syringe or being touched by a Q‐tip. Both hemodynamic activity within areas known to be involved in the processing of first and third‐person emotional experiences of pain, i.e., bilateral anterior insula, and autonomic reactivity were greater for the pain experienced by own‐race compared to that of other‐race and violet models. Interestingly, greater implicit racial bias predicted increased activity within the left anterior insula during the observation of own‐race pain relative to other‐race pain. Our findings highlight the close link between group‐based segregation and empathic processing. Moreover, they demonstrate the relative influence of culturally acquired implicit attitudes and perceived similarity/familiarity with the target in shaping emotional responses to others' physical pain.

Abstract = {Own-race faces are recognised more accurately than other-race faces and may even be viewed differently as measured by an eye-tracker (Goldinger, Papesh, & He, 2009). Alternatively, observer race might direct eye-movements (Blais, Jack, Scheepers, Fiset, & Caldara, 2008). Observer differences in eye-movements are likely to be based on experience of the physiognomic characteristics that are differentially discriminating for Black and White faces. Two experiments are reported that employed standard old/new recognition paradigms in which Black and White observers viewed Black and White faces with their eyemovements recorded. Experiment 1 showed that there were observer race differences in terms of the features scanned but observers employed the same strategy across different types of faces. Experiment 2 demonstrated that other-race faces could be recognised more accurately if participants had their first fixation directed to more diagnostic features using fixation crosses. These results are entirely consistent with those presented by Blais et al. (2008) and with the perceptual interpretation that the own-race bias is due to inappropriate attention allocated to the facial features (Hills & Lewis, 2006, 2011).

Abstract = {Other-race faces are generally recognized more poorly than own-race faces. There has been a long-standing interest in the extent to which differences in contact contribute to this other-race effect (ORE). Here, we examined the effect of contact on two distinct aspects of face memory, memory for configuration and for components, both of which are better for own-race than other-race faces. Configural and component memory were measured using recognition memory tests with intact study faces and blurred (isolates memory for configuration) and scrambled (isolates memory for components) test faces, respectively. Our participants were a large group of ethnically Chinese individuals who had resided in Australia for varying lengths of time, from a few weeks to 26 years. We found that time in a Western country significantly (negatively) predicted the size of the ORE for configural, but not component, memory. There was also a trend for earlier age of arrival to predict smaller OREs in configural, but not component, memory. These results suggest that memory for configural information in other-race faces improves with experience with such faces. However, as found for recognition memory generally, the contact effects were small, indicating that other factors must play a substantial role in cross-race differences in face memory.

Abstract = {We are reviewing the recent findings on the Other Race Effect (ORE), which is the difficulty to recognize faces from other race compared to own race faces. Several hypotheses were proposed: negative attitude (Brigham and Malpass, 1985), attentional mechanisms (Chance and Goldstein, 1981), and the contact hypothesis (Brigham et al., 1982) which postulates that the ORE is due to a lack of experience with other race’s faces. The contact hypothesis being, of course, modulated by attention and attitude. Valentine (1991 ; Valentine and Endo, 1992) proposes a norm-based coding model in which faces are encoded as vectors according to their deviation from a prototypical average. The resulting dimensions will differ according to the input received with certain salient, individuating dimensions carrying more "weight" than others. Predominant exposure to faces of a specific species, gender, or race early in life will cause the dimensions of one’s prototype to become “tuned” towards such faces. The evidence presented support Valentine’s model but we are showing that the quality of the contact is crucial in the experience. We are arguing that a developmental approach is necessary to better understand the ORE. Infants are able to process and recognize faces from an early age and several recent studies have found that the ORE can be observed from 9–10 months of age. Experimental results indicate that 6- to 9-months of age represents an important time of transition in the face processing system. If a certain type of face (other races) is not experienced prior to this period, then we appear to lose our ability to discriminate between individual faces within those groups.

Abstract = {It is well known that adults' face recognition is characterized by an 'other-race effect' (ORE; see Meissner & Brigham, 2001), but few studies have investigated this ORE during the development of the face processing system. Here we examined the role of experience with other-race faces during childhood by testing a group of 6- to 14-year-old Asian children adopted between 2 and 26 months in Caucasian families living in Western Europe, as well as a group of age-matched Caucasian children. The latter group showed a strong ORE in favour of own-race faces that was stable from 6 to 14 years of age. The adopted participants did not show a significant reversal of the ORE, unlike a recently reported study (Sangrigoli et al., 2005), but rather comparable results with Asian and Caucasian faces. Their pattern of performance was neither influenced by their age of adoption, nor by the amount of experience they accumulated during childhood with other-race faces. These results indicate that the balance of performance with Asian and Caucasian faces can be modulated, but not completely reversed, in children whose exposure to own- and other-race faces changes drastically during the period of maturation of the face recognition system, depending on the length of exposure to the new face race. Overall, experience appears to be crucial during childhood to shape the face recognition system towards the most predominant morphologies of faces present in the environment.

Abstract = {Adult observers generally find it difficult to recognize and distinguish faces that belong to categories with which they have limited visual experience. One aspect of this phenomenon is commonly known as the "Other-Race Effect" (ORE) since this behavior is typically highly evident in the perception of faces belonging to ethnic or racial groups other than that of the observer. This acquired disadvantage in face recognition likely results from highly specific "tuning" of the underlying representation of facial appearance, leading to efficient processing of commonly seen faces at the expense of poor generalization to other face categories. In the current study we used electrophysiological (event-related potentials or ERPs) and behavioral measures of performance to characterize face processing in racial categories defined by dissociable shape and pigmentation information. Our goal was to examine the specificity of the representation of facial appearance in more detail by investigating how race-specific face shape and pigmentation separately modulated neural responses previously implicated in face processing, the N170 and N250 components. We found that both components were modulated by skin color, independent of face shape, but that only the N250 exhibited sensitivity to face shape. Moreover, the N250 appears to only respond differentially to the skin color of upright faces, showing a lack of color sensitivity for inverted faces.

Abstract = {The other-race effect (ORE) in face recognition describes a well-established finding of better recognition for own-race than other-race faces. Although widely thought to reflect differences in contact between own- and other-race faces, little is known about how different contact levels relate to changes in processing of those faces. This study investigated how contact affects the size of the ORE and the use of expert configural face-coding mechanisms. Using inversion decrements as an index of configural coding, we predicted that increased self-reported contact would be associated with greater use of configural-coding mechanisms. Chinese and Caucasian participants varying in contact with other-race faces were recruited. The Chinese participants also varied in their length of residence in a Western country. Results showed that higher levels of contact were associated with a reduction in the ORE in both face recognition and configural coding. Importantly, smaller cross-race differences in configural coding were also associated with a smaller ORE in face recognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Despite recent advances in research on race and age biases, the question of how race and age experiences combine to affect young children’s face perception remains unexplored. To fill this gap, the current study tested two ethnicities of 3-year-old children using a combined cross-race/cross-age design. Caucasian children with and without older siblings and Mainland Chinese children without older siblings were tested for their ability to discriminate adult and child Caucasian faces as well as adult and child Asian faces in both upright and inverted orientations. Children of both ethnicities manifested an own-race bias, which was confined to adult faces, and an adult face bias, which was confined to own-race faces. Likewise, sibling experience affected Caucasian children’s processing of own-race child faces, but this effect did not generalize to other-race faces. Results suggest that race and age information are represented at the same hierarchical level in young children’s memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Several theories suggest that people do not represent race when it does not signify group boundaries. However, race is often associated with visually salient differences in skin tone and facial features. In this study, we investigated whether race could be decoded from distributed patterns of neural activity in the fusiform gyri and early visual cortex when visual features that often covary with race were orthogonal to group membership. To this end, we used multivariate pattern analysis to examine an fMRI dataset that was collected while participants assigned to mixed-race groups categorized own-race and other-race faces as belonging to their newly assigned group. Whereas conventional univariate analyses provided no evidence of race-based responses in the fusiform gyri or early visual cortex, multivariate pattern analysis suggested that race was represented within these regions. Moreover, race was represented in the fusiform gyri to a greater extent than early visual cortex, suggesting that the fusiform gyri results do not merely reflect low-level perceptual information (e.g. color, contrast) from early visual cortex. These findings indicate that patterns of activation within specific regions of the visual cortex may represent race even when overall activation in these regions is not driven by racial information.

Abstract = {One of the most replicable findings reported in the social psychological literature is the cross-race memory effect. We argue this effect derives from higher-order interactions among social cues that determine the perceived relevance of a face to an observer. The current research tested this hypothesis by examining the combined influences of eye gaze direction and race on face memory. The physical subtlety of eye gaze belies its powerful influence on social perception, and in this case helps specify the relevance of same- versus other-race faces. We found that only in faces making direct eye contact—not those displaying averted eye gaze—was the cross-race memory effect evident. Likewise, only in same-race faces did direct relative to averted-gaze enhance face memory. These findings have implications for our general understanding of the combinatorial nature of social perception and help clarify the underlying cause of the cross-race memory effect.

Retrospective cohort study of maternal deliveries at a single regional center from 2009 to 2010 time period (n = 11,711). Generalized linear models were used for the analysis to estimate an adjusted odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval of the association between maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, race/ethnicity and prematurity. Analysis controlled for diabetes, chronic hypertension, previous preterm birth, smoking and insurance status. The demographics of the study population were as follows, race/ethnicity had predominance in the White/Non-Hispanic population with 60.1 %, followed by the Black/Non-Hispanic population 24.2 %, the Hispanic population with 10.3 % and the Asian population with 5.4 %. Maternal pre-pregnancy weight showed that the population with a normal body mass index (BMI) was 49.4 %, followed by the population being overweight with 26.2 %, and last, the population which was obese with 24.4 %. Maternal obesity increased the odds of prematurity in the White/Non-Hispanic, Hispanic and Asian population (aOR 1.40, CI 1.12–1.75; aOR 2.20, CI 1.23–3.95; aOR 3.07, CI 1.16–8.13, respectively). Although the Black/Non-Hispanic population prematurity rate remains higher than the other race/ethnicity populations, the Black/Non-Hispanic population did not have an increased odds of prematurity in obese mothers (OR 0.87; CI 0.68–1.19). Unlike White/ Non-Hispanic, Asian and Hispanic mothers, normal prepregnancy BMI in Black/Non-Hispanic mothers was not associated with lower odds for prematurity. The odds for mothers of the White/Non-Hispanic, Hispanic and Asian populations, for delivering a premature infant, were significantly increased when obese. Analysis controlled for chronic hypertension, diabetes, insurance status, prior preterm birth and smoking. Obesity is a risk factor for prematurity in the White/Non-Hispanic, Asian and Hispanic population, but not for the Black/Non-Hispanic population. The design and evaluation of weight-based maternal health programs that aggregate race/ethnicity may not be sufficient. The optimal method to address maternal pre-pregnancy and intra-pregnancy weight-related health disorders may need to be stratified along race/ ethnicity adjusted strategies and goals. However, a more global preventative strategy that encompasses the social determinants of health may be needed to reduce the higher rates of prematurity among the Black/Non-Hispanic population.

Abstract = {The human face conveys important social signals when people interact in social contexts. The current study investigated the relationship between face recognition and emotional intelligence, and how societal factors of emotion and race influence people's face recognition. Participants’ recognition accuracy, reaction time, sensitivity, and response bias were measured to examine their face‐processing ability. Fifty Caucasian undergraduates (38 females, 12 males; average age = 21.76 years) participated in a face recognition task in which they discriminated previously presented target faces from novel distractor faces. A positive correlation between participants’ emotional intelligence scores and their performance on the face recognition task was observed, suggesting that face recognition ability was associated with emotional or social intelligence. Additionally, Caucasian participants recognized happy faces better than angry or neutral faces. It was also observed that people recognized Asian faces better than Caucasian ones, which appears to be contradictory to the classic other‐race effect. The present study suggests that some societal factors could influence face processing, and face recognition ability could in turn predict social intelligence.

Abstract = {The other-race effect emerges during infancy following the perceptual narrowing of face recognition. Other-race faces that were previously discriminable in early infancy cannot be distinguished by older infants. I discuss a Bayesian model of this process that posits that the other-race effect may be a consequence of learning to distinguish between intrapersonal variation (changes to face appearance that preserve identity) and extrapersonal variation (changes that do not preserve identity) in a visual environment in which a subset of race categories dominate. I demonstrate that race categories, which I have previously argued are a critical precursor to the emergence of the other-race effect in infancy, are a natural by-product of this model. Perceptual narrowing for race may thus be a natural consequence of visual experience and the estimation of face variability based on a growing number of exemplars. I describe the basic architecture of the model, its applicability to a range of visual learning scenarios, and identify critical choices one faces in applying the model to a specific perceptual task. Despite the success of the model in accounting for these behavioural results, I conclude by identifying important shortcomings of the model and describe important challenges for future efforts to characterize the development of the other-race effect computationally.

Verbalization and the SRA influenced face recognition independently, as evident on both behavioral (Experiment 1) and eye movement measures (Experiment 2). The findings indicate that verbalization and the SRA each recruit different types of configural processing, with verbalization modulating face learning and the SRA modulating both face learning and recognition. Eye movement patterns demonstrated greater feature sampling for describing as compared with not describing faces and for other-race as compared with same-race faces. In both cases, sampling of the eyes, nose, and mouth played a major role in performance. The findings support a single process account whereby verbalization can influence perceptual processing in a flexible and yet fundamental way through shifting one's processing orientation.

Abstract = {The other-race effect (ORE) in face recognition is typically observed in tasks which require long-term memory. Several studies, however, have found the effect early in face encoding (Lindsay, Jack, & Christian, 1991; Walker & Hewstone, 2006). In 6 experiments, with over 300 participants, we found no evidence that the recognition deficit associated with the ORE reflects deficits in immediate encoding. In Experiment 1, with a study-to-test retention interval of 4 min, participants were better able to recognise White faces, relative to Asian faces. Experiment 1 also validated the use of computer-generated faces in subsequent experiments. In Experiments 2 through 4, performance was virtually identical to Asian and White faces in match-to-sample, immediate recognition. In Experiment 5, decreasing target-foil similarity and disrupting the retention interval with trivia questions elicited a re-emergence of the ORE. Experiments 6A and 6B replicated this effect, and showed that memory for Asian faces was particularly susceptible to distraction; White faces were recognised equally well, regardless of trivia questions during the retention interval. The recognition deficit in the ORE apparently emerges from retention or retrieval deficits, not differences in immediate perceptual processing.

Abstract = {Background: Experiences of discrimination are associated with tobacco and alcohol use, and work is a common setting where individuals experience racial/ethnic discrimination. Few studies have evaluated the association between workplace discrimination and these behaviors, and none have described associations across race/ethnicity. Purpose: To examine the association between workplace discrimination and tobacco and alcohol use in a large, multistate sample of U.S. adult respondents to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey Reactions to Race Module (2004−2010). Methods: Multivariable logistic regression analyses evaluated cross-sectional associations between self-reported workplace discrimination and tobacco (current and daily smoking) and alcohol use (any and heavy use, and binge drinking) among all participants and stratified by race/ethnicity, adjusting for relevant covariates. Data were analyzed in 2013. Results: Among respondents, 70,080 completed the workplace discrimination measure. Discrimination was more common among black non-Hispanic (21%), Hispanic (12%), and other race respondents (11%) than white non-Hispanics (4%) (p < 0.001). In the total sample, discrimination was associated with current smoking (risk ratio [RR] = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.19, 1.47), daily smoking (RR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.61), and heavy drinking (RR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.22), but not binge or any drinking. Among Hispanics, workplace discrimination was associated with increased heavy and binge drinking, but not any alcohol use or smoking. Workplace discrimination among black non-Hispanics and white Non-Hispanics was associated with increased current and daily smoking, but not alcohol outcomes. Conclusions: Workplace discrimination is common, associated with smoking and alcohol use, and merits further policy attention, given the impact of these behaviors on morbidity and mortality.

Abstract = {Previous research has suggested that like animal and social fear-relevant stimuli, other-race faces (African American) are detected preferentially in visual search. Three experiments using Chinese or Indonesian faces as other-race faces yielded the opposite pattern of results: faster detection of same-race faces among other-race faces. This apparently inconsistent pattern of results was resolved by showing that Asian and African American faces are detected preferentially in tasks that have small stimulus sets and employ fixed target searches. Asian and African American other-race faces are found slower among Caucasian face backgrounds if larger stimulus sets are used in tasks with a variable mapping of stimulus to background or target. Thus, preferential detection of other-race faces was not found under task conditions in which preferential detection of animal and social fear-relevant stimuli is evident. Although consistent with the view that same-race faces are processed in more detail than other-race faces, the current findings suggest that other-race faces do not draw attention preferentially.

Abstract = {The other-race effect is a collection of phenomena whereby faces of one’s own race are processed differently from those of other races. Previous studies have revealed a paradoxical mirror pattern of an own-race advantage in face recognition and an other-race advantage in race-based categorisation. With a well-controlled design, we compared recognition and categorisation of own-race and other-race faces in both Caucasian and Chinese participants. Compared with own-race faces, other-race faces were less accurately and more slowly recognised, whereas they were more rapidly categorised by race. The mirror pattern was confirmed by a unique negative correlation between the two effects in terms of reaction time with a hierarchical regression analysis. This finding suggests an antagonistic interaction between the processing of face identity and that of face category, and a common underlying processing mechanism.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the differential effect of medication non-adherence over time on all-cause mortality by race/ethnicity. Research Design and Methods: Data on a longitudinal cohort of veterans with type 2 diabetes was examined. The main outcome was time to death. Primary independent variables were race/ethnicity and mean medication possession ratio (MPR) categorized into quintiles over the study period. Cox regression was used to model the association between time to death and MPR quintiles and race/ethnicity, adjusting for relevant covariates. Results: The cohort of 629,563 veterans was followed for 5 years. After adjusting for all covariates, the hazard ratios (HR) for subjects in the lowest versus highest MPR quintile was 12.21 (95 % CI 11.89, 12.55) for non- Hispanic white (NHW), 10.01 (95 % CI 9.18, 10.91) for non-Hispanic black (NHB), 12.65 (95 % CI 11.10, 14.43) for Hispanic and 10.41 (95 % CI 9.06, 11.96) for Other race veterans. Furthermore, type of diabetes therapy (oral versus insulin) maintained a significant relationship with mortality that varied by racial/ethnic group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the differential impact of medication non-adherence on mortality by race. It also demonstrates that type of diabetes therapy (insulin with or without oral agents) is associated with mortality and varies by racial/ethnic group.

Abstract = {A large body of research suggests that faces are processed by a specialized mechanism within the human visual system. This specialized mechanism is made up of subprocesses (Maurer, LeGrand, & Mondloch, 2002). One subprocess, called second- order relational processing, analyzes the metric distances between face parts. Importantly, it is well established that other-race faces and contrast-reversed faces are associated with impaired performance on numerous face processing tasks. Here, we investigated the specificity of second-order relational processing by testing how this process is applied to faces of different race and photographic contrast. Participants completed a feature displacement discrimination task, directly measuring the sensitivity to second-order relations between face parts. Across three experiments we show that, despite absolute differences in sensitivity in some conditions, inversion impaired performance in all conditions. The presence of robust inversion effects for all faces suggests that second-order relational processing can be applied to faces of different race and photographic contrast.

Abstract = {The other-race effect in face processing develops within the first year of life in Caucasian infants. It is currently unknown whether the developmental trajectory observed in Caucasian infants can be extended to other cultures. This is an important issue to investigate because recent findings from cross-cultural psychology have suggested that individuals from Eastern and Western backgrounds tend to perceive the world in fundamentally different ways. To this end, the current study investigated 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old Chinese infants’ ability to discriminate faces within their own racial group and within two other racial groups (African and Caucasian). The 3-month-olds demonstrated recognition in all conditions, whereas the 6-month-olds recognized Chinese faces and displayed marginal recognition for Caucasian faces but did not recognize African faces. The 9-month-olds’ recognition was limited to Chinese faces. This pattern of development is consistent with the perceptual narrowing hypothesis that our perceptual systems are shaped by experience to be optimally sensitive to stimuli most commonly encountered in one’s unique cultural environment.

In this study, Caucasian participants were trained to differentiate African American (or Hispanic) faces at the individual level (e.g., Joe, Bob) and to categorize Hispanic (or African American) faces at the basic level of race (e.g., Hispanic, African American). Behaviorally, subordinate-level individuation training led to improved performance on a posttraining recognition test, relative to basic-level training. As measured by event-related potentials, subordinate- and basic-level training had relatively little effect on the face N170 component. However, as compared with basic-level training, subordinate-level training elicited an increased response in the posterior expert N250 component. These results demonstrate that learning to discriminate other-race faces at the subordinate level of the individual leads to improved recognition and enhanced activation of the expert N250 component.

In the current experiment the typical own-race bias paradigm was modified so that type-2 signal detection measures (e.g. Higham & Arnold, 2007a,b) could be used to directly measure metacognitive monitoring at retrieval. A second goal of the experiment was to explore whether self-reported confidence ratings differed depending on whether they were directed at answer accuracy (e.g., judging a face as "studied") versus at decisions about that answer (e.g., volunteering vs. withholding that answer). Overall the results demonstrated that monitoring does contribute to the own-race bias, in that participants were better at monitoring their memory for own race faces. Further, there was a significant difference between the two confidence measures, and the pattern of this difference depended on whether responses had been volunteered or withheld.

In Experiment 1, the faces were randomly assigned to two study blocks. In each block, a group label was provided that indicated that those faces belonged to African American or to Hispanic individuals. Both participant groups exhibited superior memory for faces studied in the block with their own-race label. In Experiment 2, the faces were studied in a single block with no labels, but tested in two blocks in which labels were provided. Recognition performance was not influenced by the labeled race at test. Taken together, these results confirm the claim that purely top-down information can yield the well-documented cross-race effect in recognition, and additionally they suggest that the bias takes place at encoding rather than testing.

This study investigated the developmental origins of this other-race effect (ORE) by examining the role of a salient perceptual property of faces—that of skin color. Six- and 9-month-olds’ recognition memory for own- and other-race faces was examined using infant-controlled habituation and visual-paired comparison at test. Infants were shown own- or other-race faces in color or with skin color cues minimized in grayscale images. Results for the color stimuli replicated previous findings that infants show an ORE in face recognition memory. Results for the grayscale stimuli showed that even when a salient perceptual cue to race, such as skin color information, is minimized, 6- to 9-month-olds, nonetheless, show an ORE in their face recognition memory. Infants’ use of shape-based and configural cues for face recognition is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We investigated the neural basis underlying the effect of race on incidental facial emotional processing using functional MRI. Thirteen healthy Korean men underwent functional MRI while viewing photographs of Korean (own-race) and Caucasian (other-race) emotional faces while performing a sex discrimination task. Responses to other-race relative to own-race neutral faces replicated previous studies: activations were obtained in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/medial frontal cortex. Direct contrasts between-race emotional faces (happy and sad) also showed differential effects: the contrast of own-race relative to other-race had more activations in limbic areas (amygdala and hippocampus), whereas the contrast of other-race relative to own-race had more activations in frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes. Our findings provide evidence for differential processing of emotional faces as a function of race. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {There has been a recent surge of interest in the question of how infants respond to the social attributes of race and gender information in faces. This work has demonstrated that by 3 months of age, infants will respond preferentially to same-race faces and faces depicting the gender of the primary caregiver. In the current study, we investigated emergence of the female face preference for same- versus other-race faces to examine whether the determinants of preference for face gender and race are independent or interactive in young infants. In Expt 1, 3-month-old Caucasian infants displayed a preference for female over male faces when the faces were Caucasian, but not when the faces were Asian. In Expt 2, new-born Caucasian infants did not demonstrate a preference for female over male faces for Caucasian faces. The results are discussed in terms of a face prototype that becomes progressively tuned as it is structured by the interaction of the gender and race of faces that are experienced during early development.

Abstract = {Background: The benefits of racial/ethnic physician-patient concordance have been cited to support increasing the number of minority physicians. Few studies have examined the rates at which physicians of different race/ethnicity groups or specialties see concordant visits. We aim to determine whether differences exist in rates at which physicians of different race/ethnicity groups and physician specialties see visits by patients of concordant race/ethnicity. Methods: We used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2001-2006, a nationally representative survey of visits to private physician's offices. For physicians of each race/ethnicity group, the percentage of visits by patients in each race/ethnicity group was calculated. A concordant visit was defined as one in which a physician in a particular race/ethnicity group saw a patient of the some race/ethnicity group. Concordance rates were calculated overall, and for visits to primary care, medical specialties, and surgical specialties individually. Results: White physicians see a higher percentage of concordant visits than any other race/ethnicity of physician (84.3%, p < 0.001 vs. all others), followed by Hispanic physicians and non-Hispanic black physicians, who had statistically similar rates (50.0%, and 46.8%, p > 0.05 for comparison), with non-Hispanic Asian physicians having the lowest rate of concordant visits (14.5%, p < 0.001 vs. all others). Minority surgical and medical specialists have significantly lower rates of concordant visits (33.4% and 33.6% respectively) compared to minority primary care physicians (49.5%, p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Conclusion: Concordance rates from the physician perspective differ by physician race/ethnicity and by physician specialty. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: Studies of emotion recognition abilities in schizophrenia show greater impairment for non-Caucasians with schizophrenia compared with Caucasians. These studies, however, included only Caucasian faces as stimuli. There is evidence from healthy individuals for a performance disadvantage on face memory and emotion recognition when processing faces from a different ethnicity. The authors sought to measure the "other-race effect" in schizophrenia, which could account for previous findings and provide information about sensitivity to such social cues in patients. Method: The study included 540 participants from four groups: African Americans with schizophrenia (N=135), Caucasians with schizophrenia (N=135), African American community comparison subjects (N=135), and Caucasian community comparison subjects (N=135). All participants completed face recognition and facial emotion identification tasks that included both Caucasian and African American faces as stimuli. Results: Although comparison participants performed better than individuals with schizophrenia across all tasks, both comparison participants and participants with schizophrenia exhibited a strong and significant other-race effect for face memory and emotion recognition. The magnitude of the other-race effect did not differ between these two groups. Conclusions: These findings reveal an intact other-race effect in patients with schizophrenia and highlight a methodological concern in the measurement of face processing abilities in schizophrenia, namely, that findings of greater impairment in African American patients are spurious when Caucasian faces are used as stimuli. Despite overall impairments in face memory and emotion recognition, the presence of a normative other-race effect in schizophrenia may reflect typical experiences with faces during development.

Abstract = {The question as to whether poser race affects the happy categorization advantage, the faster categorization of happy than of negative emotional expressions, has been answered inconsistently. Hugenberg (2005) found the happy categorization advantage only for own race faces whereas faster categorization of angry expressions was evident for other race faces. Kubota and Ito (2007) found a happy categorization advantage for both own race and other race faces. These results have vastly different implications for understanding the influence of race cues on the processing of emotional expressions. The current study replicates the results of both prior studies and indicates that face type (computer-generated vs. photographic), presentation duration, and especially stimulus set size influence the happy categorization advantage as well as the moderating effect of poser race.

Abstract = {Background: People are better at recognizing faces of their own race than faces of another race. Such race specificity may be due to differential expertise in the two races. Method: In order to find out whether this other-race effect develops as early as face-recognition skills or whether it is a long-term effect of acquired expertise, we tested face recognition in 3-month-old Caucasian infants by conducting two experiments using Caucasian and Asiatic faces and a visual pair-comparison task. We hypothesized that if the other race effect develops together with face processing skills during the first months of life, the ability to recognize own-race faces will be greater than the ability to recognize other-race faces: 3-month-old Caucasian infants should be better at recognizing Caucasian faces than Asiatic faces. If, on the contrary, the other-race effect is the long-term result of acquired expertise, no difference between recognizing own- and other-race faces will be observed at that age. Results: In Experiment 1, Caucasian infants were habituated to a single face. Recognition was assessed by a novelty preference paradigm. The infants' recognition performance was better for Caucasian than for Asiatic faces. In Experiment 2, Caucasian infants were familiarized with three individual faces. Recognition was demonstrated with both Caucasian and Asiatic faces. Conclusions: These results suggest that (i) the representation of face information by 3-month-olds may be race-experience-dependent (Experiment 1), and (ii) short-term familiarization with exemplars of another race group is sufficient to reduce the other-race effect and to extend the power of face processing (Experiment 2).

Abstract = {Experience plays a crucial role in the development of face processing. In the study reported here, we investigated how faces observed within the visual environment affect the development of the face-processing system during the 1st year of life. We assessed 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old Caucasian infants' ability to discriminate faces within their own racial group and within three other-race groups (African, Middle Eastern, and Chinese). The 3-month-old infants demonstrated recognition in all conditions, the 6-month-old infants were able to recognize Caucasian and Chinese faces only, and the 9-month-old infants' recognition was restricted to own-race faces. The pattern of preferences indicates that the other-race effect is emerging by 6 months of age and is present at 9 months of age. The findings suggest that facial input from the infant's visual environment is crucial for shaping the face-processing system early in infancy, resulting in differential recognition accuracy for faces of different races in adulthood.

Abstract = {The Cross-Race Effect (CRE) is the well-replicated finding that people are better at recognizing faces from their own race, relative to other races. The CRE reveals systematic limitations on eyewitness identification accuracy, suggesting that some caution is warranted in evaluating cross-race identification. The CRE is problematic because jurors value eyewitness identification highly in verdict decisions. We explore how accurate people are in predicting their ability to recognize own-race and other-race faces. Caucasian and Asian participants viewed photographs of Caucasian and Asian faces, and made immediate judgments of learning during study. An old/new recognition test replicated the CRE: both groups displayed superior discriminability of own-race faces. Importantly, relative metamnemonic accuracy was also greater for own-race faces, indicating that the accuracy of predictions about face recognition is influenced by race. This result indicates another source of concern when eliciting or evaluating eyewitness identification: people are less accurate in judging whether they will or will not recognize a face when that face is of a different race than they are. This new result suggests that a witness's claim of being likely to recognize a suspect from a lineup should be interpreted with caution when the suspect is of a different race than the witness.

Abstract = {In the current study, we investigated how complete infant deprivation to out-group race impacts behavioral and neural sensitivity to race. Although monkey models have successfully achieved complete face deprivation in early life, this is typically impossible in human studies. We overcame this barrier by examining youths with exclusively homogenous racial experience in early postnatal development. These were youths raised in orphanage care in either East Asia or Eastern Europe as infants and later adopted by American families. The use of international adoption bolsters confidence of infant exposure to race (e.g., to solely Asian faces or European faces). Participants completed an emotional matching task during functional MRI. Our findings show that deprivation to other-race faces in infancy disrupts recognition of emotion and results in heightened amygdala response to out-group faces. Greater early deprivation (i.e., later age of adoption) is associated with greater biases to race. These data demonstrate how early social deprivation to race shapes amygdala function later in life and provides support that early postnatal development may represent a sensitive period for race perception.

Abstract = {Extensive behavioral and neural evidence suggests that processing of own-race faces differs from that of other-race faces in both adults and infants. However, little research has examined whether and how children scan faces of own and other races differently for face recognition. In this eye-tracking study, Chinese children aged from 4 to 7 years and Chinese adults were asked to remember Chinese and Caucasian faces. None of the participants had any direct contact with foreign individuals. Multi-method analyses of eye-tracking data revealed that regardless of age group, proportional fixation duration on the eyes of Chinese faces was significantly lower than that on the eyes of Caucasian faces, whereas proportional fixation duration on the nose and mouth of Chinese faces was significantly higher than that on the nose and mouth of Caucasian faces. In addition, the amplitude of saccades on Chinese faces was significantly lower than that on Caucasian faces, potentially reflecting finer-grained processing for own-race faces. Moreover, adults’ fixation duration/saccade numbers on the whole faces, proportional fixation percentage on the nose, proportional number of saccades between AOIs, and accuracy in recognizing faces were higher than those of children. These results together demonstrate that an abundance of visual experience with own-race faces and a lack of it with other-race faces may result in differential facial scanning in both children and adults. Furthermore, the increased experience of processing faces may result in a more holistic and advanced scanning strategy in Chinese adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Early in the first year of life infants exhibit equivalent performance distinguishing among people within their own race and within other races. However, with development and experience, their face recognition skills become tuned to groups of people they interact with the most. This developmental tuning is hypothesized to be the origin of adult face processing biases including the other‐race bias. In adults the other‐race bias has also been associated with impairments in facial emotion processing for other‐race faces. The present investigation aimed to show perceptual narrowing for other‐race faces during infancy and to determine whether the race of a face influences infants’ ability to match emotional sounds with emotional facial expressions. Behavioral (visual‐paired comparison; VPC) and electrophysiological (event‐related potentials; ERPs) measures were recorded in 5‐month‐old and 9‐month‐old infants. Behaviorally, 5‐month‐olds distinguished faces within their own race and within another race, whereas 9‐month‐olds only distinguish faces within their own race. ERPs were recorded while an emotion sound (laughing or crying) was presented prior to viewing an image of a static African American or Caucasian face expressing either a happy or a sad emotion. Consistent with behavioral findings, ERPs revealed race‐specific perceptual processing of faces and emotion/sound face congruency at 9 months but not 5 months of age. In addition, from 5 to 9 months, the neural networks activated for sound/face congruency were found to shift from an anterior ERP component (Nc) related to attention to posterior ERP components (N290, P400) related to perception.

To assess whether this so-called other-race effect can be reversed by subsequent experience with new types of faces, we tested adults of Korean origin who were adopted by European Caucasian families when they were between the ages of 3 to 9. The adoptees performed a face recognition task with photographs of Caucasian and Asian faces. They performed exactly like a control group of French participants, identifying the Caucasian faces better than the Asian ones. In contrast, a control group of Koreans showed the reverse pattern.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach About Human Difference by Ann Morning (2011). The phrase "race is a social construction" has become a tired truism. The sociology of race commonly begins by asserting that race as biology or the "essentialist" perspective was prevalent in the early days of scholarship on the topic but has since given way to a "constructionist" viewpoint. We now "know" that race, while not a biological reality, is most certainly a social one. But beyond the walls of sociology classes and scholarship, how prevalent is a constructionist viewpoint? Ann Morning's The Nature of Race: What Scientists Think and Teach about Human Difference answers this call by providing a thoughtful, rigorous, and highly compelling treatise on the reach of race concepts and the notion that differences between races are "essential," thus grounded in biology or "constructed" and contingent upon political, social, and cultural realities. Drawing on a wide array of sources—from content analyses of high school textbooks, to surveys and in-depth interviews with 41 faculty (from the natural and social sciences) and 49 students from a variety of majors, Morning paints a rich and complex picture of a rarely studied facet of racial thinking: how people define it. The book also examines the status of race concepts outside of the classroom, in realms generally perceived to be race neutral—the U.S. census, the law, criminal forensics, and the medical community. The main claim is that biological essentialism is very much alive, but not well understood. Morning begins with a history of race concepts, including the rise of race science and ending with the demise of eugenics. This sets the stage for documenting the splintering of race concepts held by the public and those held by professional scientists. Morning builds an exhaustive case for the need to know how the public defines race, even as many scholars have researched how the public thinks about race relationships. The book reveals that essentialism is not only more complex than previously thought but also more prevalent among scientists and students than constructionism. Although this book provides a largely neutral treatment of two competing perspectives, in the closing chapter Morning considers the implication that we may be going down an essentialist route. She highlights the fact that the viewing racial difference as essential removes the need to examine the impact of any type of discrimination when interpreting the persistence of inequality. Well-written, well-researched, and well-argued, The Nature of Race does an excellent job of tracing out the power of knowing how race is defined, leaving room for future research to examine how race concepts emerge among a variety of university settings, student populations, and institutions, and how race definitions underlie other race-related phenomenon. While "race as a social construction" is a common phrase, scholars in the field cannot be the only ones who understand it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study demonstrates that experience and development interact to influence the "cross-race effect." In a multination study (n = 245), Caucasian children and adults of European ancestry living in the United States, Norway, or South Africa, as well as biracial (Caucasian-African American) children and adults living in the United States, were tested for recognition of Asian, African, and Caucasian faces. Regardless of national or biracial background, 8- to 10-year-olds, 12- to 14-year-olds, and adults recognized own-race faces more accurately than other-race faces, and did so to a similar extent, whereas 5- to 7-year-olds recognized all face types equally well. This same developmental pattern emerged for biracial children and adults. Thus, early meaningful exposure did not substantially alter the developmental trajectory. During young childhood, developmental influences on face processing operate on a system sufficiently plastic to preclude, under certain conditions, the cross-race effect.

Abstract = {We examined the effect of visual experience on the magnitude of a novel eye-size illusion: when the size of a face’s frame is increased or decreased but eye size is unchanged, observers judge the size of the eyes to be different from that in the original face frame. In the current study, we asked Chinese and Caucasian participants to judge eye size in different pairs of faces and measured the magnitude of the illusion when the faces were own- or other-age (adult vs. infant faces) and when the faces were own- or other-race (Chinese vs. Caucasian faces). We found an other-age effect and an other-race effect with the eye-size illusion: The illusion was more pronounced with own-race and own-age faces than with other-race and other-age faces. These findings taken together suggest that visual experience with faces influences the magnitude of this novel illusion. Extensive experience with certain face categories strengthens the illusion in the context of these categories, but lack of it reduces the magnitude of the illusion. Our results further imply that holistic processing may play an important role in engendering the eye-size illusion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Adults’ processing of own-race faces differs from that of other-race faces. The presence of an "other-race" feature (ORF) has been proposed as a mechanism underlying this specialization. We examined whether this mechanism, which was previously identified in adults and in 9-month-olds, is evident at 3.5 months. Caucasian 3.5-month-olds looked longer at a pattern containing a single Asian face among seven Caucasian faces than at a pattern containing a single Caucasian face among seven Asian faces. Homogenous and inverted face control conditions indicated that infants’ preference was not driven by the majority of faces in arrays or by low-level features. Thus, 3.5-month-olds found the presence of an other-race face among own-race faces to be more salient than the reverse configuration. This asymmetry suggests sensitivity to an ORF at 3.5 months. Thus, a key mechanism of race-based processing in adults has an early onset, indicating rapid development of specialization early in life.

Abstract = {Background: Alcohol and marijuana are commonly used and misused in the United States, both singly and together. Despite this, few studies examine their co-occurring use and the corresponding association with public health and other problems.Moreover, there is a lack of investigation into differences in these associations on the basis of race/ethnicity. Methods: The present study estimated the frequency of alcohol use disorder, marijuana use disorder, and co-occurring alcohol and marijuana use disorder and their associated public health and social problems in Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics. This cross-sectional study included 13,872 individuals and used data from the 2005–2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Frequency was calculated and multinomial regression was used to assess associations between substance use disorder and psychosocial, adverse consequences such as history of being arrested, substance use treatment, and sexually transmitted infection. Results: Alcohol use disorder was comparable between, and most prevalent among, Whites and Hispanics compared to African Americans, whereas marijuana use disorder was greatest among African Americans compared to other race/ethnicities.Co-occurring alcohol and marijuana use disorders were most prevalent for African Americans versus Whites and Hispanics, and similar in Whites and Hispanics. In general, major depressive episode was more prevalent for respondents with co-occurring use disorders or single marijuana use disorders. However, race/ethnicity differences in associations between substance use disorder and psychosocial correlates and adverse consequences were observed. Conclusions: Findings have implications for race/ethnicity appropriate integrated prevention and treatment of single and co-occurring use disorders and psychiatric comorbidities.

Abstract = {Purpose: National guidelines for alcohol screening and brief interventions advise practitioners to consider age, drinking frequency, and context to identify at-risk youth. The purpose of this study was to identify the contextual risk and protective factors in high school-aged adolescents associated with future driving after drinking (Drinking Under the Influence [DUI] at age 21) by race/ethnicity. Methods: Data included 10,271 adolescents (67% white, 12% Hispanic, 16% black, 3.6% Asian; 49% Male) who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Waves I, II, and III) from 1995 to 2001. A lagged panel design and survey logistic regression was used to examine the association between multiple contextual factors (e.g., demographics, parents, peers, social context) during adolescence and self-reported DUI in young adulthood. Results: As expected, the likelihood of DUI was higher among whites followed by Hispanics, Asians, and blacks in all models. Perception of easy home access to alcohol increased risk for future DUI for whites (OR: 1.25 CI: 1.04e1.49), Hispanics (OR: 2.02 CI: 1.29e3.16), and Asians (OR: 1.90 CI: 1.13e3.22), but not for black youth. Drinking frequency and prior DUI were not risk factors for Hispanics. Risk-taking attitudes, marijuana use, and religious affiliation were risk factors for whites only. Conclusions: Findings suggest that in addition to screening for drinking behaviors, brief interventions and prevention efforts should assess perceived home access to alcohol and other race-specific factors to reduce alcohol-related injuries and harm.

Abstract = {People are more likely to falsely identify a face of another race than a face of their own race. When witnesses make identifications, they often need to remember where they have previously encountered a face. Failure to remember the context of an encounter can result in unconscious transference and lead to misidentifications. Forty-five White participants were shown White and Black faces, each presented on one of five backgrounds. The participants had to identify these faces in an old/new recognition test. If participants stated that they had seen a face, they had to identify the context in which the face had originally appeared. Participants made more context errors with Black faces than with White faces. This shows that the own-race bias extends to context memory.

Abstract = {Other-race individuals are remembered more poorly and receive less holistic/configural processing than same-race individuals, at least when faces are novel. Here, we examine the amelioration of these effects with familiarity, using distinctiveness-matched Caucasian and Asian stimulus sets. We confirmed a cross-race deficit for upright faces following a single encoding trial, which disappeared rapidly with practice on a small set of other-race 'friends' and did not re-emerge when perceptual processing was put under stress (presentation in the periphery). We also examined holistic/configural processing for familiarised faces using the peripheral inversion effect (McKone, 2004 Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition30 181 -197). A test for faces and nonface objects (dogs) confirmed the validity of this technique as providing a direct measure of holistic processing; we then showed that, after 1 h of training, holistic processing was as strong for other-race as same-race faces. We conclude that practice with other-race individuals can rapidly engage normal face-processing mechanisms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Human adults are more accurate at discriminating faces from their own race than faces from another race. This other-race effect (ORE) has been characterized as a reflection of face processing specialization arising from differential experience with own-race faces. We examined whether 3.5-month-old infants exhibit ORE using morphed faces on which adults had displayed a crossover ORE (i.e., Caucasians performed better on Caucasian faces and Asians performed better on Asian faces). In this experiment, Caucasian infants who had grown up in a predominantly Caucasian environment discriminated 100% Caucasian faces from 70% Caucasian/30% Asian morphed faces but failed to discriminate between the corresponding 100% Asian and 70% Asian/30% Caucasian faces. Thus, 3.5-month-olds exhibited evidence of ORE. These results indicate that at least by 3.5 months of age, infants have attained enough face processing expertise to process familiar-race faces in a different manner than unfamiliar-race faces.

Abstract = {Research over the past two decades has demonstrated that individuals are better at recognizing and discriminating faces of their own race versus other races. The own-race effect has typically been investigated in relation to recognition memory; however, some evidence supports an own-race effect at the level of perceptual encoding in adults. The current study investigated the developmental basis of the own-race effect in White primary students (aged 7-11), secondary students (aged 12-15) and university students. Face stimuli were generated by morphing South Asian and White parent faces together along a linear continuum. In a same/different perceptual discrimination task, participants judged whether the face stimuli (morphs and parent faces) were physically identical to or different from the original parent faces. Results revealed a significant race of face effect for each age group, whereby participants were better at discriminating White relative to Asian faces. A significantly larger own-race effect was observed for the secondary and university students than for primary students. A questionnaire was used to assess other-race social anxiety and contact; however, this self-report measure was not found to be related to the observed own-race effect.

Abstract = {Humans show stronger empathy for in-group compared with out-group members' suffering and help in-group members more than out-group members. Moreover, the in-group bias in empathy and parochial altruism tend to be more salient in collectivistic than individualistic cultures. This work tested the hypothesis that modifying self-construals, which differentiate between collectivistic and individualistic cultural orientations, affects in-group bias in empathy for perceived own-race vs other-race pain. By scanning adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found stronger neural activities in the mid-cingulate, left insula and supplementary motor area (SMA) in response to racial in-group compared with out-group members' pain after participants had been primed with interdependent self-construals. However, the racial in-group bias in neural responses to others' pain in the left SMA, mid-cingulate cortex and insula was significantly reduced by priming independent self-construals. Our findings suggest that shifting an individual's self-construal leads to changes of his/her racial in-group bias in neural responses to others' suffering.

Abstract = {Variability in mental health services utilization by race/ethnicity was evaluated with a Behavioral Model approach. Subjects were 17,705 children 5 to 11 years of age in the 2005, 2007, and 2009 California Health Interview Surveys. Parents identified minor emotional difficulties in 18.7% of these children (ranging from 14.8% in Asians to 24.4% in African Americans) and definite or severe difficulties in 7.4% (5.5% in Asians to 9.7% in “other race”). Overall, 7.6% of children had at least one mental health visit in the prior year (2.3% in Asians to 11.2% in African Americans). Parent-identified need was the most salient predictor of mental health visits for all racial/ethnic groups. Beyond need, no consistent patterns could be determined across racial/ethnic groups with regard to the relationship between contextual, predisposing, and enabling measures and mental health service utilization. Different factors operated for each racial/ethnic group, suggesting the need for studies to examine mental health need, mental health service use, and determinants by racial/ethnic subgroup. These findings suggest that a “one-size-fits-all approach” with regard to policies and practices aimed at reducing mental health disparities will not be effective for all racial/ethnic groups.

The authors discuss articles in the March 2001 issue of Psychology, Public Policy, and Law as well as some methodological and interpretational problems regarding demonstrations of the other-race identification effect. In spite of some problems with the literature, they conclude that the other-race identification effect is real and that it is relevant to the criminal justice system. The authors propose a system-variable approach in which other-race identification cases receive special preventive treatment at the time of the identification test rather than after-the-fact attempts to assist triers of fact. These preventive procedures include using same-race lineup constructors, larger numbers of fillers in other-race cases, dual lineup techniques in other-race cases, or a combination of these procedures.

The study by Humphreys et al. was replicated using the same stimuli, while participants' eye movements were recorded. These revealed that there was no attentional bias towards own-race faces (analysed in terms of fixation order, number, and duration), but people still detected changes in own-race faces faster than in other-race faces. The current results therefore give further support for the original claim that people are less sensitive to changes made in other-race faces, when own- and other-race faces are equally attended.

Primary outcome was self-reported gainful employment. A total of 26.8% were working, and Caucasians were most likely to work followed by Hispanics and African Americans. Education and injury severity were strong predictors of working but did not attenuate the relationship between race and working. African American women were more likely to work than African American men, but this relationship was not significant for other race groups. Further research is needed to identify modifiable risk factors that can decrease the gap in post-injury employment between African Americans and other races.

Abstract = {Background: Promoting racial/ethnic diversity within the physician workforce is a national priority. However, the extent of racial/ethnic discrimination reported by physicians from diverse backgrounds in today’s health-care workplace is unknown. Objective: To determine the prevalence of physician experiences of perceived racial/ethnic discrimination at work and to explore physician views about race and discussions regarding race/ethnicity in the workplace. Design: Cross-sectional, national survey conducted in 2006–2007. Participants: Practicing physicians (total n = 529) from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds in the United States. Measurements and main results: We examined physicians’ experience of racial/ethnic discrimination over their career course, their experience of discrimination in their current work setting, and their views about race/ethnicity and discrimination at work. The proportion of physicians who reported that they had experienced racial/ethnic discrimination “sometimes, often, or very often” during their medical career was substantial among non-majority physicians (71% of black physicians, 45% of Asian physicians, 63% of “other” race physicians, and 27% of Hispanic/Latino(a) physicians, compared with 7% of white physicians, all p < 0.05). Similarly, the proportion of non-majority physicians who reported that they experienced discrimination in their current work setting was substantial (59% of black, 39% of Asian, 35% of “other” race, 24% of Hispanic/Latino(a) physicians, and 21% of white physicians). Physician views about the role of race/ethnicity at work varied significantly by respondent race/ethnicity. Conclusions: Many non-majority physicians report experiencing racial/ethnic discrimination in the workplace.

Drawing on the contextual amplification hypothesis, it was hypothesized that the effect of pubertal development on substance use would vary by level of neighborhood disadvantage and race. The sample included 5,591 adolescent girls from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (23% Black, 15% Hispanic, 55% White, and 7% Other race). Results showed that the relationships between pubertal development, neighborhood disadvantage, and alcohol use varied for girls from different racial backgrounds. Although there was some of evidence of contextual amplification among Black adolescent girls, low levels of neighborhood disadvantage tended to be associated with higher levels of alcohol use during early adolescence. Findings highlight the importance of studying the interaction between individual- and environmental-level risk factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Configural and holistic coding are hallmarks efface perception. Although recent studies have shown that own-race faces are coded more holistically than other-race faces, the evidence for better configural coding of own-race faces is equivocal. We directly measured configural and component coding of own- and other-race male faces in Caucasian and Chinese participants. We manipulated individual features (components) or their spatial relations (configurations) using a novel morphing method to vary difficulty parametrically and tested sensitivity to these changes in a sequential matching task. Both configural and component coding were better for upright own-race than for upright other-race faces. Inversion impaired detection of configural changes more than it did detection of component changes, but also impaired performance more for easier discriminations, independent of type of change. These results challenge explanations of face expertise that rely solely on configural and holistic processing, and also call into question the widespread interpretation of large inversion decrements as diagnostic of configural coding.

Here we tested the hypothesis that the "other-race effect" is related to a reduced ability to encode configural information on other-race faces. Caucasian and Asian participants had to match whole faces to isolated facial features, or onto whole faces differing by a single feature, on both Caucasian and Asian faces. Participants performed better with whole faces as compared to isolated features, demonstrating a "holistic processing" effaces (Tanaka & Farah, 1993). For Caucasian participants, this "whole/ part advantage" was observed only for Caucasian faces. Asian participants who had been living for about a year among Caucasians had a comparable whole/part advantage regardless the race of the faces. These results indicate that same-race faces are processed more holistically than other-race faces, as a result of experience. However, despite processing Caucasian faces as holistically as Asian faces in this paradigm, Asian subjects still presented a large other-race effect. This observation suggests that holistic encoding may be a necessary step in order to be able to recognize other-race faces efficiently, but that it is by no means sufficient to overcome the other-race face effect.

Abstract = {People are generally better at remembering faces of their own race than faces of a different race, and this effect is known as the own-race bias (ORB) effect. We used eye-tracking and pupillometry to investigate whether Caucasian and Asian face stimuli elicited different-looking patterns in Caucasian participants in a face-memory task. Consistent with the ORB effect, we found better recognition performance for own-race faces than other-race faces, and shorter response times. In addition, at encoding, eye movements and pupillary responses to Asian faces (i.e., the other race) were different from those to Caucasian faces (i.e., the own race). Processing of own-race faces was characterized by more active scanning, with a larger number of shorter fixations, and more frequent saccades. Moreover, pupillary diameters were larger when viewing other-race than own-race faces, suggesting a greater cognitive effort when encoding other-race faces.

Abstract = {The human face provides a wealth of information pertaining to the internal state and life-stage history of an individual. Facial width-to-height ratio is a size-independent sexually dimorphic trait, and estimates of aggression made by untrained adults judging own-race faces were positively associated with both facial width-to-height ratio and actual aggressive behavior. Given the significant adaptive value of accurately detecting aggressiveness based on facial appearance, we hypothesized that aggression estimates made by adults and 8-year-old children would be highly correlated with male facial width-to-height ratio even for a face category with which they had minimal experience—other-race faces. For each of the four race and age groups, estimates of aggression were positively correlated with facial width-to-height ratio irrespective of rating own- or other-race faces. Overall, the correlations between facial width-to-height ratio and ratings of aggression were stronger for adults than for children. Sensitivity to facial width-to-height ratio appears to be part of an evolved mechanism designed to detect threats in the external environment. This mechanism is likely broadly tuned and functions independently of experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Young adult participants are known to more accurately remember faces from both their own age- and ethnic groups. The present study examined combined effects of such own-age and own-race biases by asking young Caucasian participants to learn and remember elderly and young Caucasian as well as elderly and young Asian faces. Neural correlates were assessed by recording event-related potentials (ERPs). Behavioral results indicated both an own-race bias for young but not elderly faces, and an own-age bias for Caucasian but not Asian faces. Importantly, no additional decrease in recognition memory for other-race/other-age faces was detected. An early parietal ERP old/new effect (300–500 ms) was most pronounced for young Caucasian "in-group" faces, while the old/new effect in a later time window (500–800 ms) was generally larger for own- as compared to other-race faces. In conclusion, these findings suggest at least partly different neural processes to accompany the own-race and own-age biases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that, in person-recognition tasks, people perform better for faces belonging to their own race than for those belonging to another race. Recently, however, this 'other-race' effect has also been found in a sex-discrimination task (A. O'Toole et al, 1996). In the present study, we investigated whether this finding extends to age perception. Caucasian and African participants (aged 20-45 yrs old) were asked to estimate the age of Caucasian and African faces. The main result of this experiment was a significant 'race of subject' x 'race of face' interaction showing that Caucasian participants performed better at evaluating Caucasian faces than African faces. However, African participants performed equally with both type of faces. This result is explained by the Africans' time of residence in Belgium. The implication of this 'other race' effect for age estimation is discussed with respect to eyewitness reports. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Other-race (OR) faces are less accurately recognized than same-race (SR) faces, but faster classified by race. This phenomenon has often been reported as the 'other-race' effect (ORE). Valentine (1991 Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology43 161-204) proposed a theoretical multidimensional face-space model that explained both of these results, in terms of variations in exemplar density between races. According to this model, SR faces are more widely distributed across the dimensions of the space than OR faces. However, this model does not quantify nor state the dimensions coded within this face space. The aim of the present study was to test the face-space explanation of the ORE with neural network simulations by quantifying its dimensions. We found the predicted density properties of Valentine's framework in the face-projection spaces of the autoassociative memories. This was supported by an interaction for exemplar density between the race of the learned face set and the race of the faces. In addition, the elaborated face representations showed optimal responses for SR but not for OR faces within SR face spaces when explored at the individual level, as gender errors occurred significantly more often in OR than in SR face-space representations. Altogether, our results add further evidence in favor of a statistical exemplar density explanation of the ORE as suggested by Valentine, and question the plausibility of such coding for faces in the framework of recent neuroimaging studies.

Abstract = {It was shown that own (vs. other) race baby faces capture attention automatically whereas other race babies do not (Hodsoll et al., 2010). Other literature provided evidence of an innate preferential response to baby faces (baby schema effect). We investigated whether infant (vs. adult) faces automatically attracted attention (exogenous orienting), and whether this was modulated by ethnicity. 30 students took part in this study. Their task was to decide whether a lateralized target was upright or inverted. Targets were preceded by 400 baby or adult (Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian) faces shortly flashed in the same location, thus acting as spatial cues (valid/invalid). Results showed no effect of the ethnic group but of face age in speeding up RTs to targets preceded by baby faces. Significant costs for invalid locations cued by baby faces were also found (difficulty in disengagement). The data indicate how visual attention is literally captured by baby schema, independent of baby race. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {On the basis of findings that categorical perception (CP) is possible in complex visual stimuli such as faces, this study tested for CP on continua between unfamiliar face pairs. In Exp 1, continua between pairs of faces were tested for the presence of CP with 16 Asian and White Ss. In Exp 2, the same stimulus set and procedures as Exp 1 were used with 14 White Ss but the faces were inverted. The results indicate that CP can be observed for unfamiliar faces, in both familiar (same-race) and unfamiliar (other-race) groups. In addition, significant CP effects were observed in inverted faces. Finally, half-continua were tested where midpoint stimuli became endpoints with 41 Asian, Indian, and White Ss (Exp 3). This was done to ensure that stimulus artifacts did not account for the observed CP effects. Consistent with the perceptual rescaling associated with CP, half-continua showed a rescaled CP effect. It is argued that these CP effects are based on the rapid acquisition of perceptual equivalence classes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Our prior visual experience plays a critical role in face perception. We show superior perceptual performance for differentiating conspecific (vs non-conspecific), own-race (vs other-race) and familiar (vs unfamiliar) faces. However, it remains unclear whether our experience with faces of other species would influence our gaze allocation for extracting salient facial information. In this eye-tracking study, we asked both dog owners and non-owners to judge the approachability of human, monkey and dog faces, and systematically compared their behavioural performance and gaze pattern associated with the task. Compared to non-owners, dog owners assessed dog faces with shorter time and fewer fixations, but gave higher approachability ratings. The gaze allocation within local facial features was also modulated by the ownership. The averaged proportion of the fixations and viewing time directed at the dog mouth region were significantly less for the dog owners, and more experienced dog owners tended to look more at the dog eyes, suggesting the adoption of a prior experience-based viewing behaviour for assessing dog approachability. No differences in behavioural performance and gaze pattern were observed between dog owners and non-owners when judging human and monkey faces, implying that the dog owner’s experience-based gaze strategy for viewing dog faces was not transferable across faces of other species.

(b) The ORCA is similarly robust for full faces and for face parts. (c) The ORCA was larger when the configuration of the inner-face components was distorted, reflecting delayed categorization of own-race distorted faces relative to own-race normally configured faces but no conspicuous distortion effect on other-race faces. These data demonstrate that perceptual factors can account for the ORCA independently of social bias.

Abstract = {Averaged face composites, which represent the central tendency of a familiar population of faces, are attractive. If this prototypicality contributes to their appeal, then averaged composites should be more attractive when their component faces come from a familiar, own-race population than when they come from a less familiar, other-race population. We compared the attractiveness of own-race composites, other-race composites, and mixed-race composites (where the component faces were from both races). In experiment 1, Caucasian participants rated own-race composites as more attractive than other-race composites, but only for male faces. However, mixed-race (Caucasian/Japanese) composites were significantly more attractive than own-race composites, particularly for the opposite sex. In experiment 2, Caucasian and Japanese participants living in Australia and Japan, respectively, selected the most attractive face from a continuum with exaggerated Caucasian characteristics at one end and exaggerated Japanese characteristics at the other, with intervening images including a Caucasian averaged composite, a mixed-race averaged composite, and a Japanese averaged composite. The most attractive face was, again, a mixed-race composite, for both Caucasian and Japanese participants. In experiment 3, Caucasian participants rated individual Eurasian faces as significantly more attractive than either Caucasian or Asian faces. Similar results were obtained with composites. Eurasian faces and composites were also rated as healthier than Caucasian or Asian faces and composites, respectively. These results suggest that signs of health may be more important than prototypicality in making average faces attractive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

First, we investigated whether practice individuating other‐race faces yields improvement in perceptual discrimination for novel faces of that race. Second, we asked whether there was similar improvement for novel faces of a different race for which participants received equal practice, but in an orthogonal task that did not require individuation. Caucasian participants were trained to individuate faces of one race (African American or Hispanic) and to make difficult eye‐luminance judgments on faces of the other race. By equating these tasks we are able to rule out raw experience, visual attention, or performance/success‐induced positivity as the critical factors that produce race‐specific improvements.

Abstract = {Background: After a gradual decline from 1990 to 2004, the percentage of births occurring at home in the United States increased by 5 percent in 2005 and that increase was sustained in 2006. The purpose of the study was to analyze trends and characteristics in home births in United States by race and ethnicity from 1990 to 2006. Methods: U.S. birth certificate data on home births were analyzed and compared with hospital births for a variety of demographic and medical characteristics. Results: From 1990 to 2006, both the number and percentage of home births increased for non‐Hispanic white women, but declined for all other race and ethnic groups. In 2006, non‐Hispanic white women were three to four times more likely to have a home birth than women of other race and ethnic groups. Home births were more likely than hospital births to occur to older, married women with singleton pregnancies and several previous children. For non‐Hispanic white women, fewer home births than hospital births were born preterm, whereas for other race and ethnic groups a higher percentage of home births than hospital births were born preterm. For non‐Hispanic white women, two‐thirds of home births were delivered by midwives. In contrast, for other race and ethnic groups, most home births were delivered by either physicians or "other" attendants, suggesting that a higher proportion of these births may be unplanned home births because of emergency situations. Conclusions: Differences in the risk profile of home births by race and ethnicity are consistent with previous research, suggesting that, compared with non‐Hispanic white women, a larger proportion of non‐Hispanic black and Hispanic home births represent unplanned, emergency situations.

Abstract = {Discrimination and recognition are often poorer for other-race than own-race faces. These other-race effects (OREs) have traditionally been attributed to reduced perceptual expertise, resulting from more limited experience, with other-race faces. However, recent findings suggest that sociocognitive factors, such as reduced motivation to individuate other-race faces, may also contribute. If the sociocognitive hypothesis is correct, then it should be possible to alter discrimination and memory performance for identical faces by altering their perceived race. We made identical ambiguous-race morphed faces look either Asian or Caucasian by presenting them in Caucasian or Asian face contexts, respectively. However, this perceived-race manipulation had no effect on either discrimination (Experiment 1) or memory (Experiment 2) for the ambiguous-race faces, despite the presence of the usual OREs in discrimination and recognition of unambiguous Asian and Caucasian faces in our participant population.

Abstract = {Human expertise at processing faces relies on how facial features are encoded: as a whole template rather than as a sum of independent features. This holistic encoding is less prominent for other-race faces, possibly accounting for the difficulty one encounters in recognizing these faces (the 'other-race effect'). Here, we tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of holistic face encoding can be modulated by racial categorization of the face. Caucasian participants performed a face-composite task with 'racially-ambiguous' face-stimuli (cross-race morphed faces, equally categorized as Asian or Caucasian faces in an independent task). The perceived race of the ambiguous faces was manipulated using adaptation. Experiment 1 showed that identical morphed face-stimuli were processed more holistically when perceived as 'same-race' than as 'other-race', i.e., following adaptation to 'other-race' versus 'same-race', respectively. Experiment 2 ascertained that the determining factor in the observed holistic processing modulation was the race of the racially-ambiguous face as perceived, rather than expected, by the participants, which supports the idea that the holistic processing of the face-stimuli was modulated by their race-categorization at the perceptual level.

The ABC model's prediction was supported in that right-norm distortions would be the more effective transformation, irrespective of race, because these distortions maximize the reduction in local exemplar density. European faces were also rated as more distinctive and recognized more easily than Chinese faces.

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that participants use different eye movement strategies when scanning own- and other-race faces. However, it is unclear (1) whether this effect is related to face recognition performance, and (2) to what extent this effect is influenced by top-down or bottom-up facial information. In the present study, Chinese participants performed a face recognition task with Chinese, Caucasian, and racially ambiguous faces. For the racially ambiguous faces, we led participants to believe that they were viewing either own-race Chinese faces or other-race Caucasian faces. Results showed that (1) Chinese participants scanned the nose of the true Chinese faces more than that of the true Caucasian faces, whereas they scanned the eyes of the Caucasian faces more than those of the Chinese faces; (2) they scanned the eyes, nose, and mouth equally for the ambiguous faces in the Chinese condition compared with those in the Caucasian condition; (3) when recognizing the true Chinese target faces, but not the true target Caucasian faces, the greater the fixation proportion on the nose, the faster the participants correctly recognized these faces. The same was true when racially ambiguous face stimuli were thought to be Chinese faces. These results provide the first evidence to show that (1) visual scanning patterns of faces are related to own-race face recognition response time, and (2) it is bottom-up facial physiognomic information that mainly contributes to face scanning. However, top-down knowledge of racial categories can influence the relationship between face scanning patterns and recognition response time.

Abstract = {We used a change blindness paradigm to examine the "other race" effect in perception. White Caucasian and Indian Asian participants viewed scenes in which White Caucasian and Indian Asian students were present. Changes were made either to the faces of the students, to their bodies or to an independent object in the background. Changes in faces were detected faster than changes in the bodies, which were in turn detected faster than changes in the background. For face detection there was a crossover interaction, with changes in White Caucasian faces detected faster than changes in Indian Asian faces by White Caucasian participants, whilst the opposite result occurred for changes in Indian Asian faces. In contrast, there was no effect of race on the detection of body-part changes or on the detection of changes to background objects. The results suggest that participants of both races attended equally well to subjects from the other race in the scene, but despite this they remained less sensitive to "other race" faces. Change blindness can provide a useful way of analysing attentional and memorial processes in social contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Neonates display reliable visual preferences for human faces and face-like stimuli, which has been taken as strong evidence for an innate domain-specific bias toward faces. Alternatively, neonatal face preference can be explained by an innate non-specific top-heavy configuration bias on the basis that faces are inherently top-heavy. This review article aims to address the early specialization process for face and race in Taiwanese infants based our recent work. In the first two sections, we will review the classic findings on the neonatal face preference research. Three broad theories, the sensory hypothesis by linear system approach in the late 80s, the innate domain-specific representation hypothesis in the early 90s, and the non-specific top-heavy bias hypothesis in the last decade, will be addressed and compared. In the third section, we further explored some deeper issues regarding the top-heavy configuration bias hypothesis as well as our recent follow-up work. Using a forced-choice novelty preference method, we found that 2.5- to 4.5-month-old infants showed significant and equal novelty preferences, suggesting a reliable discriminability between the two configurations and a disappearance of the top-heavy bias. Moreover, using an eye-tracker, we investigated whether the top-heavy bias is still present in 3- to 5.5-month olds and in adults as a comparison group, and found no evidence for the top-heavy bias in both infants and adults. In the forth section, we illustrated the idea of an early specialization process for human face and race. Several recent developmental cognitive neuroscience studies on the infant brain as well as the behavioral studies on the other-race-effect in Caucasian and Taiwanese infants were reviewed. Taken together, our position on early face processing is in line with experience-expectant view; this view considers the brain specialization as emerging gradually from the interaction between small innate constraints and the critical input provided by the species-typical or race-typical environment.

Abstract = {Do infants develop meaningful social preferences among novel individuals based on their social group membership? If so, do these social preferences depend on familiarity on any dimension, or on a more specific focus on particular kinds of categorical information? The present experiments use methods that have previously demonstrated infants’ social preferences based on language and accent, and test for infants’ and young children’s social preferences based on race. In Experiment 1, 10-month-old infants took toys equally from own- and other-race individuals. In Experiment 2, 2.5-year-old children gave toys equally to own- and other-race individuals. When shown the same stimuli in Experiment 3, 5-year-old children, in contrast, expressed explicit social preferences for own-race individuals. Social preferences based on race therefore emerge between 2.5 and 5 years of age and do not affect social choices in infancy. These data will be discussed in relation to prior research finding that infants’ social preferences do, however, rely on language: a useful predictor of group or coalition membership in both modern times and humans’ evolutionary past.

Abstract = {The other-race effect (or own-race bias or cross-racial identification effect) refers to the finding that recognition memory tends to be better for faces of members of Ss' own race than for faces of members of other races. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that perceptual skills specific to identifying faces of particular racial groups contribute to this effect. On each of 50 trials, a photograph of a face was tachistoscopically presented for 120 msec, followed by a pattern mask and then a plain-view test pair composed of the previously presented face and a matched foil. As predicted, an other-race effect was obtained on this perceptual task: White Ss performed significantly more poorly on trials involving African American faces than on trials involving White faces, whereas no such difference was obtained among African American Ss.

Taken together, the current studies demonstrated that differential performance on own-race faces was largely due to qualitative differences in the encoding of facial information represented by a recollection process. Furthermore, false recollections with high ratings of confidence occurred more often when participants encoded and responded to unfamiliar other-race faces. The theoretical implications of these findings for the phenomenology of skilled perceptual-memory are discussed, and the applied consequences of the cross-race effect as an encoding-based phenomenon are considered.

Abstract = {The neural correlates of the perception of faces from different races were investigated. White participants performed a gender identification task in which Asian, Black, and White faces were presented while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Participants also completed an implicit association task for Black (IAT-Black) and Asian (IAT-Asian) faces. ERPs evoked by Black and White faces differed, with Black faces evoking a larger positive ERP that peaked at 168 ms over the frontal scalp, and White faces evoking a larger negative ERP that peaked at 244 ms. These Black/White ERP differences significantly correlated with participants' scores on the IAT-Black. ERPs also differentiated White from Asian faces and a significant correlation was obtained between the White-Asian ERP difference waves at ~500 ms and the IAT-Asian. A positive ERP at 116 ms over occipital scalp differentiated all three races, but was not correlated with either IAT. In addition, a late positive component (around 592 ms) was greater for the same race compared to either other race faces, suggesting potentially more extended or deeper processing of the same race faces. Taken together, the ERP/IAT correlations observed for both other races indicate the influence of a race-sensitive evaluative process that may include early more automatic and/or implicit processes and relatively later more controlled processes.

Abstract = {We use data from the 2006 American Community Survey to examine race and ethnic differences in the effects of marital status and co-residence of the middle generation on the likelihood of poverty among grandfathers who have primary responsibility for co-resident grandchildren (N = 3,379). Logistic regression results indicate that race/ethnicity and household composition are significant predictors of poverty for grandfather caregivers: non-Hispanic white grandfathers, those who are married, and those with a co-resident middle generation are the least likely to be poor. The effects of race/ethnicity, marital status, and the presence of a middle generation are, however, contingent upon one another. Specifically, the negative effect of being married is lower among grandfathers who are Hispanic, African American, non-Hispanic, and non-Hispanics of other race/ethnic groups compared to whites. In addition, having a middle generation in the home has a larger negative effect on poverty for race/ethnic minority grandfathers than for non-Hispanic whites. Finally, the combined effects of marriage and a middle generation vary across race/ethnic group and are associated with lower chances of poverty among some groups compared with others. We use the theory of cumulative disadvantage to interpret these findings and suggest that race/ ethnicity and household composition are synergistically related to economic resources for grandfather caregivers.

Using data from a cross-sectional survey of YMSM (ages 18–29) living in Detroit Metro (N = 328; 9 % HIV-positive; 49 % Black, 27 % White, 15 % Latino, 9 % Other race), we used multilevel modeling to examine the association between community-level characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage; distance to LGBT-affirming institutions) and YMSM’s HIV testing behavior and likelihood of engaging in unprotected anal intercourse with serodiscordant partner(s). We accounted for individual-level factors (race/ethnicity, poverty, homelessness, alcohol and marijuana use) and contextual factors (community acceptance and stigma regarding same-sex sexuality). YMSM in neighborhoods with greater disadvantage and nearer to an AIDS Service Organization were more likely to have tested for HIV and less likely to report serodiscordant partners. Community acceptance was associated with having tested for HIV. Efforts to address YMSM’s exposure to structural barriers in Detroit Metro are needed to inform HIV prevention strategies from a socioecological perspective.

Abstract = {Studies have shown that individuals are better able to recognise the faces of people from their own race than the faces of people from other races. Although the so-called own-race effect has been generally regarded as an advantage in recognition memory, differences in the processing of the own-race versus other-race faces might also be found at the earlier stages of perceptual encoding. In this study, the perceptual basis of the own-race effect was investigated by generating a continuum of images by morphing an East Asian parent face with a Caucasian parent face. In a same/different discrimination task, East Asian and Caucasian participants judged whether the morph faces were physically identical to, or different from, their parent faces. The results revealed a significant race-of-participant by race-of-face interaction such that East Asian participants were better able to discriminate East Asian faces, whereas Caucasian participants were better able to discriminate Caucasian faces. These results indicate that an own-race advantage occurs at the encoding stage of face processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The authors investigated the neural substrates of same-race memory superiority using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (fMRI). 19 European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) males underwent fMRI while they viewed photographs of AA males, EA males and objects under intentional encoding conditions. Recognition memory was superior for same-race vs other-race faces. Individually defined areas in the fusiform region that responded preferentially to faces had greater response to same-race vs other-race faces. Across both groups, memory differences between same-race and other-race faces correlated with activation in left fusiform cortex and right parahippocampal and hippocampal areas. These results suggest that differential activation in fusiform regions contributes to same-race memory superiority. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Delinquent youth are at risk for early violent death after release from detention. However, few studies have examined risk factors for mortality. Previous investigations studied only serious offenders (a fraction of the juvenile justice population) and provided little data on females. Methods: The Northwestern Juvenile Project is a prospective longitudinal study of health needs and outcomes of a stratified random sample of 1829 youth (657 females, 1172 males; 524 Hispanic, 1005 African American, 296 non-Hispanic white, 4 other race/ethnicity) detained between 1995 and 1998. Data on risk factors were drawn from interviews; death records were obtained up to 16 years after detention. We compared all-cause mortality rates and causes of death with those of the general population. Survival analyses were used to examine risk factors for mortality after youth leave detention. Results: Delinquent youth have higher mortality rates than the general population to age 29 years (P < .05), irrespective of gender or race/ethnicity. Females died at nearly 5 times the general population rate (P < .05); Hispanic males and females died at 5 and 9 times the general population rates, respectively (P < .05). Compared with the general population, significantly more delinquent youth died of homicide and its subcategory, homicide by firearm (P < .05). Among delinquent youth, racial/ethnic minorities were at increased risk of homicide compared with non-Hispanic whites (P < .05). Significant risk factors for external-cause mortality and homicide included drug dealing (up to 9 years later), alcohol use disorder, and gang membership (up to a decade later). Conclusions: Delinquent youth are an identifiable target population to reduce disparities in early violent death. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Unlike indicator (dummy) codes that imply that one group will be a reference group, effect codes use average responses as a means for interpreting information. This technique is especially appropriate for examining race, as such a process enables raced subgroups to be compared to each other and does not position responses of any raced group as normative the standard against which all other race effects are interpreted. The issues raised here apply in any research context where a categorical variable without a natural reference group (e.g. college major) is a potential predictor in a regression model.

Sixty-two channel ERPs were recorded in 12 Caucasian subjects presented with Caucasian and Asian faces along with non-face objects. Surface data were submitted to classical waveforms and ERP map topography analysis. Underlying brain sources were estimated with two inverse solutions (BESA and LORETA). The N170 face component was identical for both race faces. This component and its topography revealed a face specific pattern regardless of race. However, in this time period OR faces evoked significantly stronger medial occipital activity than SR faces. Moreover, in terms of maps, at around 170 ms face-specific activity significantly preceded non-face object activity by 25 ms. It is concluded that the N170 was not sensitive to the race of the faces. However, a possible pre-attentive process associated to the relatively stronger unfamiliarity for OR faces was found in medial occipital area.

Abstract = {Studied difference in memory encoding of eastern and western faces (the DM effect) and the neural mechanisms of other race effect by using event-related potential (ERP) experiments. Results showed that the early components (peak latency 70-120ms) at frontal scalp elicited by western faces have a more positive-going than those elicited by eastern faces regardless of recall. This suggests that more resources are allocated to other-race faces in the early stage of processing, which supports the characteristic selective theory of other race effect. The late positive component (LPC) evoked by recognized faces is more positive-going than that evoked by unrecognized faces regardless of eastern or western faces. However, the DM effect elicited by western faces is smaller at the latency range 240 to 320 ms. Moreover, there is an obvious N260 at occipital area for the eastern faces, but none or very small N260 for the western faces. The N260 reflects the different encoding manner for different-race faces in the brain and can reasonably be called a "Specific Race Component".

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that attention deployment in visual search tasks is modulated by face race and emotional expression, with a search asymmetry in favor of those faces that are less efficiently discriminated and recognized at the individual level (i.e., other-race faces and angry faces). Face age is another dimension affecting how faces are remembered, as it has been widely reported that young adults show significant deficits in recognizing other-age faces. By comparing adults’ search efficiency for own- and other-age faces in a visual search task in which face age was the target feature we explored whether the mirror pattern of detection and recognition effects found for race biases generalizes to age biases, and whether search efficiency for adult and nonadult faces is modulated by experience accumulated with nonadult faces. Search efficiency was greater for adult faces than for infant (Experiment 1) or child faces (Experiment 2) in adults with limited experience with infants or children, whereas there was no sign of search asymmetry in preschool teachers who have had extensive recent experience with children (Experiment 2). Results indicate that the influence of age on attention deployment parallels the effects that this face attribute has on face recognition, and that both effects are experience-based.

Abstract = {The present study examined whether student evaluations of college teaching (SETs) reflected a bias predicated on the perceived race and gender of the instructor. Using anonymous, peer-generated evaluations of teaching obtained from RateMyProfessors.com, the present study examined SETs from 3,079 White; 142 Black; 238 Asian; 130 Latino; and 128 Other race faculty at the 25 highest ranked liberal arts colleges. Results showed that racial minority faculty, particularly Blacks and Asians, were evaluated more negatively than White faculty in terms of overall quality, helpfulness, and clarity, but were rated higher on easiness. A two-stage cluster analysis demonstrated that the very best instructors were likely to be White, whereas the very worst were more likely to be Black or Asian. Few effects of gender were observed, but several interactions emerged showing that Black male faculty were rated more negatively than other faculty. The results of the present study are consistent with the negative racial stereotypes of racial minorities and have implications for the tenure and promotion of racial minority faculty.

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this article is to address a chief criticism of public meetings in democratic society, a lack of minority representation. Further, it explores the issue of political efficacy and the extent to which it may differ between minority and nonminority citizens. Methods: These issues are analyzed through logistic and multiple regression models applied to the results of a random‐sample telephone survey administered across the United States (N = 601). Results: Results indicate that members of one minority group, African Americans, are more likely to attend public meetings than whites. Further, no statistically significant differences between whites and Hispanics or other‐race individuals were found. African Americans also reported higher levels of political efficacy than whites, while no statistically significant difference was found between whites and Hispanics or other‐race individuals for this measure. Conclusion: Thus, public meetings are not necessarily fraught with a lack of minority representation, nor do minorities necessarily suffer from lower levels of political efficacy than whites. Findings indicate a potential for minority representation in public meetings. Thus, rather than dismissing public meetings as legally required rituals, there is reason to improve the methods used to mobilize attendance and facilitate two‐way communication between citizens and government.

Abstract = {We examined predictions derived from Valentine’s (1991) Multidimensional Space (MDS) framework for own- and other-race face processing. A set of 20 computerized faces was generated from a single prototype. Each face was saved as Black and White, changing only skin tone, such that structurally identical faces were represented in both race categories. Participants made speeded "same-different" judgments to all possible combinations of faces, from which we generated psychological spaces, with "different" RTs as the measure of similarity. Consistent with the MDS framework, all faces were pseudo-normally distributed around the (unseen) prototype. The distribution of faces was consistent with Valentine’s (1991) predictions: despite their physical identity to the White faces, Black faces had lower mean inter-object distances in psychological space. Other-race faces are more densely clustered in psychological space, which could underlie well-known recognition deficits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The present study examined whether 6- and 9-month-old Caucasian infants could categorize faces according to race. In Experiment 1, infants were familiarized with different female faces from a common ethnic background (i.e. either Caucasian or Asian) and then tested with female faces from a novel race category. Nine-month-olds were able to form discrete categories of Caucasian and Asian faces. However, 6-month-olds did not form discrete categories of faces based on race. In Experiment 2, a second group of 6- and 9-month-olds was tested to determine whether they could discriminate between different faces from the same race category. Results showed that both age groups could only discriminate between different faces from the own-race category of Caucasian faces. The findings of the two experiments taken together suggest that 9-month-olds formed a category of Caucasian faces that are further differentiated at the individual level. In contrast, although they could form a category of Asian faces, they could not discriminate between such other-race faces. This asymmetry in category formation at 9 months (i.e. categorization of own-race faces vs. categorical perception of other-race faces) suggests that differential experience with own- and other-race faces plays an important role in infants’ acquisition of face processing abilities.

Abstract = {People are generally better in recognizing faces from their own ethnic group as opposed to faces from another ethnic group, a finding which has been interpreted in the context of two opposing theories. Whereas perceptual expertise theories stress the role of long-term experience with one’s own ethnic group, race feature theories assume that the processing of an other-race-defining feature triggers inferior coding and recognition of faces. The present study tested these hypotheses by manipulating the learning task in a recognition memory test. At learning, one group of participants categorized faces according to ethnicity, whereas another group rated facial attractiveness. Subsequent recognition tests indicated clear and similar own-race biases for both groups. However, ERPs from learning and test phases demonstrated an influence of learning task on neurophysiological processing of own- and other-race faces. While both groups exhibited larger N170 responses to Asian as compared to Caucasian faces, task-dependent differences were seen in a subsequent P2 ERP component. Whereas the P2 was more pronounced for Caucasian faces in the categorization group, this difference was absent in the attractiveness rating group. The learning task thus influences early face encoding. Moreover, comparison with recent research suggests that this attractiveness rating task influences the processes reflected in the P2 in a similar manner as perceptual expertise for other-race faces does. By contrast, the behavioural own-race bias suggests that long-term expertise is required to increase other-race face recognition and hence attenuate the own-race bias.

Abstract = {People recognize faces of their own race more accurately than faces of other races. The "contact" hypothesis suggests that this "other-race effect" occurs as a result of the greater experience we have with own- versus other-race faces. The computational mechanisms that may underlie different versions of the contact hypothesis were explored in this study. The authors replicated the other-race effect with human participants and evaluated four classes of computational face recognition algorithms for the presence of an other-race effect. Consistent with the predictions of a developmental contact hypothesis, "experience-based models" demonstrated an other-race effect only when the representational system was developed through experience that warped the perceptual space in a way that was sensitive to the overall structure of the model's experience with faces of different races. When the model's representation relied on a feature set optimized to encode the information in the learned faces, experience-based algorithms recognized minority-race faces more accurately than majority-race faces. The results suggest a developmental learning process that warps the perceptual space to enhance the encoding of distinctions relevant for own-race faces.

Results showed a generalized own-race effect for White and South Asian participants discriminating own- versus other-race (White/South Asian and Black) faces, such that individuals demonstrated a perceptual discrimination advantage for own- versus other-race faces in general.

Abstract = {Adults process other-race faces differently than own-race faces. For instance, a single other-race face in an array of own-race faces attracts Caucasians’ attention, but a single own-race face among other-race faces does not. This perceptual asymmetry has been explained by the presence of an other-race feature in other-race faces and its absence in own-race faces; this difference is thought to underlie race-based differences in face processing. We examined the developmental origins of this mechanism in two groups of Caucasian 9-month-olds. Infants in the experimental group exhibited a preference for a pattern containing a single Asian face among seven Caucasian faces over a pattern containing a single Caucasian face among seven Asian faces. This preference was not driven by the majority of elements in the images, because a control group of infants failed to exhibit a preference between homogeneous patterns containing eight Caucasian versus eight Asian faces. The results demonstrate that an other-race face among own-race faces attracts infants’ attention but not vice versa. This perceptual asymmetry suggests that the other-race feature is available to Caucasians by 9 months of age, thereby indicating that mechanisms of specialization in face processing originate early in life.

Abstract = {Human beings are natural experts at processing faces, with some notable exceptions. Same-race faces are better recognized than other-race faces: the so-called other-race effect (ORE). Inverting faces impairs recognition more than for any other inverted visual object: the so-called face inversion effect (FIE). Interestingly, the FIE is stronger for same- compared to other-race faces. At the electrophysiological level, inverted faces elicit consistently delayed and often larger N170 compared to upright faces. However, whether the N170 component is sensitive to race is still a matter of ongoing debate. Here we investigated the N170 sensitivity to race in the framework of the FIE. We recorded EEG from Western Caucasian and East Asian observers while presented with Western Caucasian, East Asian and African American faces in upright and inverted orientations. To control for potential confounds in the EEG signal that might be evoked by the intrinsic and salient differences in the low-level properties of faces from different races, we normalized their amplitude-spectra, luminance and contrast. No differences on the N170 were observed for upright faces. Critically, inverted same-race faces lead to greater recognition impairment and elicited larger N170 amplitudes compared to inverted other-race faces. Our results indicate a finer-grained neural tuning for same-race faces at early stages of processing in both groups of observers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

White Os discriminated male and female Whites more accurately while Asian Os discriminated Japanese faces more accurately. These show that the identification of the most salient of facial characteristics, face sex, is impaired for other race faces and that the nature and diversity of the experience with faces affect the efficacy of a perceptual discrimination process.

Abstract = {This study sought to identify features of peer victimization that aggravate negative outcomes in children. The features that were assessed include “power imbalance,” a commonly used criterion in defining bullying, and 5 other characteristics: injury, weapon involvement, Internet involvement, sexual content, and bias content. Three outcomes were assessed: level of fear, missing school, and trauma symptoms. A nationally representative sample of 3,164 children and youth ages 6–17 (51.8% male; 68.4% white, 12.5% black, 13.5% Hispanic, 5.7% other race) was obtained through Random Digit Dial and supplemented with an address-based sample to capture cell-phone–only households. One child was randomly selected from each household. Interviews were conducted with parents of children age 6–9 and with the youths themselves if they were age 10–17. Peer victimization was assessed with the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ). Almost half (48.4%) of the entire sample of school-age children experienced at least 1 form of peer victimization in the past year. Injury and power imbalance independently increased the impact on children for all 3 outcomes. Additionally, weapon involvement and sexual content were associated with trauma symptoms, with sexual content having the strongest effect (B = .23, p < .001). This diversity of aggravating features suggests a need to reconsider the current emphasis on prioritizing bullying with its exclusionary power imbalance definition as the central focus for prevention and intervention. We recommend a broader focus on peer victimization along with more research to identify the aggravating features that signal the greatest need for intervention.

Data are from linked New York City birth certificates 1994–2004. The sample comprised nulliparous women ages ≥18 with two consecutive singleton births (N = 115,651). The dependent variable was interconception weight change. Adjusted analyses were from ordinary least squares regression model fully interacted by race/ethnic group, controlling for covariates. Within race/ethnic groups, adjusted interconception weight change was calculated for each GWG level compared with GWG 20–24 pounds; across groups, weight change was calculated for each group compared with white non-Hispanics. GWG ≥40 pounds was 18 % for Asian Pacific Islanders, and 27–29 % for other race/ethnic groups. Interconception weight change >15 pounds was highest for black non-Hispanics (34 %) and lowest for Asian Pacific Islanders (17 %). In the multivariable analysis, mean interconception weight change increased with increasing GWG in all race/ethnic groups, an average of 1.5–1.6 pounds for each 5-pound GWG interval. Compared with white non-Hispanics, adjusted mean interconception weight change was higher at every GWG level for black non-Hispanics (3.5–5.1 pounds), and at every level except <15 pounds for Hispanics (1.6–3.0 pounds). GWG ≥40 pounds was prevalent in all groups. GWG contributes to long-term interconception weight change, and non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics are at risk of greater weight change. Interventions at many levels, during and after pregnancy, are needed to support women to achieve healthy GWG and postpartum weight loss. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Two parties interested in the results of such investigations include (1) legal policymakers (e.g., state legislators and police chiefs) and (2) triers of guilt and innocence (e.g., judges and jurors). Which type of analysis is the most relevant to which party? The answer is largely a matter of whether the variable in question is a system variable or an estimator variable. ROC analysis, which measures discriminability, is critical for understanding system variables that affect eyewitness accuracy (e.g., the best lineup procedures). Thus, policymakers should be particularly attuned to the results of ROC analysis when making decisions about those variables. CAC analysis, which directly measures the confidence–accuracy relationship for suspect IDs, is critical for understanding the effect of estimator variables on eyewitness accuracy (e.g., exposure duration). Thus, triers of guilt and innocence should be particularly attuned to the results of CAC analysis. The utility of both analyses to system and estimator variables is illustrated by examining both types of analyses on previously published experiments and new experiments.

Abstract = {This research investigated the hypothesis that better recognition for own-race than other-race faces is a result of social categorization rather than perceptual expertise. More specifically, we explored how the salience of race or university group boundaries would affect recall of faces. Using a modified facial recognition paradigm, on each trial eight Black and White faces were spatially organized either by race or university affiliation to induce categorization primarily based on one of these dimensions. When grouped by race, participants had superior recall for own-race faces and university affiliation had no effect. When grouped by university, participants had superior recall for own-university faces and race had no effect. Using identical stimuli across conditions, recall was superior for ingroup targets on the experimentally induced dimension of categorization, supportive of a social categorization based explanation of the cross-race effect.

Abstract = {To learn whether the N170 would be differentially affected by orientation inversion of same- and other-race faces, we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in Caucasian and locally resident Asian subjects viewing upright and upside-down front-view photographs of African, Asian, and Caucasian faces. Results show that the time-to-peak was significantly delayed for inverted Caucasian faces in both subject groups. The same-race N170 peaked later than either other-race N170 in the Caucasian, but showed no significant difference between Caucasian and Asian faces in the Asian participants. Inversion, therefore, appears to affect the N170’s latency predominantly for faces of familiar races. This conclusion gains support from a positive correlation between the latency of the N170 evoked by both upright and inverted Caucasian faces and the amount of time that the Asian participants had lived in Europe. The N170’s race- and inversion-dependent latency increase may, thus, express an impairment of processing that emphasizes individuation of familiar-race faces, and develops during familiarization.

Abstract = {Neuroimaging studies have shown that the face-related regions of the brain, including the amygdala and the fusiform gyrus, are activated when subjects viewed the faces of their own race as compared to those of other races. These regions have been regarded as the neural correlates of "in-group advantage," a phenomenon showing superior performance for the same-race face than for other-race faces in behavioral experiments. However, in these neuroimaging studies, faces of notably different races have been used for comparisons, and thus far, no study has investigated brain activity associated with positive expression. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study involving the Japanese participants, we investigated brain activation in response to viewing happy and neutral faces of Japanese, non-Japanese Asian, and Caucasian races. Analysis of covariance using the mean happiness rating as a covariate revealed that as compared to viewing of neutral faces, viewing of happy faces by the Japanese subjects resulted in greater activation of the posterior cingulate cortex under the same-race condition than under other-race conditions. In addition, parametric modulation analysis showed that clusters in a part of the posterior cingulate cortex and in the superior temporal gyrus were associated with subjective judgment of the facial features that resembled those of the Japanese race. The left amygdala activity differed between the races; however, it is more likely that this difference was related to the differences in the subjective rating of facial happiness than to the recognition of the race per se. Therefore, we considered that the posterior cingulate cortex is the neural correlate that is specifically involved when Japanese subjects judge the happy expression on the same-race face. These results may indicate that in the Japanese participants a sense of familiarity played a role in the neural processing of a positive expression on the same-race face.

Abstract = {Objectives: We investigated temporal patterns from 1984 to 2006 in 6 weight-related health behaviors by using longitudinal data for multiple cohorts of young adults (aged 19–26 years) from the nationally representative Monitoring the Future Study. Methods: We used growth curve models to examine historical trends in 6 health behaviors: frequency of eating breakfast, eating green vegetables, eating fruit, exercising, watching television, and sleeping 7 hours each night. Variations across gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status were investigated. Results: Frequency of exercising was consistently lower among young adult women than young adult men over this 23-year period. Compared with White women, Hispanic women, and women from other race/ethnic groups, Black women showed declines in the frequency of exercise since 1984. In general, young adult women showed a marked increase in the frequency of eating breakfast over this period, although Black women did not show any net gains. Conclusions: Social disparities in body weight may increase because Black women, Hispanic women, and men with lower socioeconomic status show declining trends in positive weight-related health behaviors compared with White young adults with higher socioeconomic status.

Caucasian American 8-month-olds (Experiment 1) and 4- month-olds (Experiment 2) were tested in a habituation-switch procedure designed to assess holistic (attending to the relationship between internal and external features of the face) versus featural (attending to individual features of the face) processing of faces. Eight-month-olds demonstrated holistic processing of upright own-race (Caucasian) faces, but featural processing of upright other-race (African) faces. Inverted faces were processed featurally, regardless of ethnicity. Four-month-olds, however, demonstrated holistic processing of both Caucasian and African upright faces. These results demonstrate that infants’ processing of own- versus other-race faces becomes specialized between 4 and 8 months. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Methods: A secondary data analysis of the Arizona Trauma Database consisting of 18 944 cases of TBI between 2008–2010 throughout the state of Arizona was conducted. There were 312 patients who experienced injuries caused by IPV in the sample. Descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, bivariate analyses and a logistic regression model were used for analyses. Results: The logistic regression model found that Native Americans (OR = 1.15), patients from the other race category (OR = 1.18), females (OR = 1.35) and those who were insured (OR = 1.26) had higher odds of experiencing a TBI as a result of IPV. Rurality and intoxication were mediators of the correlation between Native American race and TBI as a result of IPV.

Abstract = {Background: Pacific Kids DASH for Health (PacDASH) aimed to improve child diet and physical activity (PA) level and prevent excess weight gain and elevation in blood pressure (BP) at 9 months. Methods: PacDASH was a two-arm, randomized, controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00905411). Eighty-five 5- to 8-yearolds in the 50th–99th percentile for BMI were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 41) or control (n = 44) groups; 62 completed the 9-month trial. Sixty-two percent were female. Mean age was 7.1 – 0.95 years. Race/ethnicity was Asian (44%), Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (28%), white (21%), or other race/ethnicity (7%). Intervention was provided at baseline and 3, 6 and 9 months, with monthly supportive mailings between intervention visits, and a follow-up visit at 15 months to observe maintenance. Diet and PA were assessed by 2-day log. Body size, composition, and BP were measured. The intervention effect on diet and PA, body size and composition, and BP by the end of the intervention was tested using an F test from a mixed regression model, after adjustment for sex, age, and ethnic group. Results: Fruit and vegetable (FV) intake decreased less in the treatment than control group ( p = 0.04). Diastolic BP (DBP) was 12 percentile units lower in the treatment than control group after 9 months of intervention ( p = 0.01). There were no group differences in systolic BP (SBP) or body size/composition. Conclusions: The PacDASH trial enhanced FV intake and DBP, but not SBP or body size/composition.

Abstract = {Angry faces are perceived as more masculine by adults. However, the developmental course and underlying mechanism (bottom-up stimulus driven or top-down belief driven) associated with the angry-male bias remain unclear. Here we report that anger biases face gender categorization toward “male” responding in children as young as 5–6 years. The bias is observed for both own- and other-race faces, and is remarkably unchanged across development (into adulthood) as revealed by signal detection analyses (Experiments 1–2). The developmental course of the angry-male bias, along with its extension to other-race faces, combine to suggest that it is not rooted in extensive experience, e.g., observing males engaging in aggressive acts during the school years. Based on several computational simulations of gender categorization (Experiment 3), we further conclude that (1) the angry-male bias results, at least partially, from a strategy of attending to facial features or their second-order relations when categorizing face gender, and (2) any single choice of computational representation (e.g., Principal Component Analysis) is insufficient to assess resemblances between face categories, as different representations of the very same faces suggest different bases for the angry-male bias. Our findings are thus consistent with stimulus-and stereotyped-belief driven accounts of the angry-male bias. Taken together, the evidence suggests considerable stability in the interaction between some facial dimensions in social categorization that is present prior to the onset of formal schooling.

Abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between individual-level support for the 2010 Affordable Care Act and nativism, the perception that a traditional American culture and way of life needs to be protected against foreign influence. The results of an analysis of a 2011 public opinion survey demonstrate that nativism was an independent and significant predictor of opposition to health care reform and that this effect held for both Republicans as well as Democrats, although the relationship is stronger for Republicans. This is substantively important for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that certain sub-groups of the American public evaluate public policy proposals on the basis of their perceived “foreignness.” Second, it demonstrates that while nativism is traditionally associated with immigration and other race/ethnic-based policy preferences, it also affects attitudes toward other seemingly race-neutral policies in the United States.

Abstract = {We investigated how face-selective cortical areas process configural and componential face information and how race of faces may influence these processes. Participants saw blurred (preserving configural information), scrambled (preserving componential information), and whole faces during fMRI scan, and performed a post-scan face recognition task using blurred or scrambled faces. The fusiform face area (FFA) showed stronger activation to blurred than to scrambled faces, and equivalent responses to blurred and whole faces. The occipital face area (OFA) showed stronger activation to whole than to blurred faces, which elicited similar responses to scrambled faces. Therefore, the FFA may be more tuned to process configural than componential information, whereas the OFA similarly participates in perception of both. Differences in recognizing own- and other-race blurred faces were correlated with differences in FFA activation to those faces, suggesting that configural processing within the FFA may underlie the other-race effect in face recognition.

Abstract = {This article focuses on sequence learning on the Visual Expectation Paradigm (VExP) using human faces as stimulus material. For a sample of 133 Caucasian German infants assessed longitudinally at 3 and 6 months of age, a previous study has shown that the response latency of 6-month-old infants was shorter when the infants solved the task with Caucasian own-race faces in contrast to African other-race faces. The advantage for own-race faces occurs at the same age the Other-Race-Effect (ORE) has been reported to emerge. As studies on ORE development have shown the phenomenon in infants from various cultural backgrounds, the follow-up question to be answered here is whether the performance differences on the VExP can also be found in other than Caucasian infants. As a complement to the German sample, 30 African infants from Cameroon were assessed longitudinally with the same VExP task at ages 3 and 6 months. Our results indicate that perception differences between own-race and other-race faces influence performance on the VExP in both samples. As expected, the Cameroonian infants improved performance on the VExP from 3 to 6 months only in their own-race African faces condition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Martha E. Billings et al. (see record [rid]2013-13444-011[/rid]). Billings et al. report an examination of sleep duration as a mediator of disparate CPAP adherence outcomes among black and other race/ethnic groups. Approaching this complex problem from the hypothetical perspective that habitual sleep may differ by race and residential socioeconomic status among adults with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), Billings et al. conducted a secondary analysis of data from the HomePAP study, a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial testing the utility of portable monitoring devices for diagnosis and treatment of OSA. The sleep duration findings reported by Billings et al. are consistent with previous findings, with black participants self-reporting shorter sleep duration than other groups, including whites and Hispanics. Longer sleep latency among black participants compared with others was also identified. Finally, the study by Billings et al. highlights the importance of the CPAP adherence metric employed both in empiric and clinical settings. The findings, in addition to recognizing disparities exist among adults with OSA in terms of sleep duration and CPAP use patterns, bring attention to the need for a parsimonious metric of CPAP adherence for clinical and empiric application. Future research addressing CPAP adherence will therefore be further strengthened by including the simultaneous measurement of sleep duration with CPAP use in order to define CPAP adherence in an equitable and precise manner for meaningful translation to clinical practice.

Abstract = {Objective: The association of medication adherence with race has been inadequately studied previously in type-2 diabetes patients. The study objective was to determine the association between race and medication adherence among type-2 diabetes patients. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study, which compared medication adherence among different races of Medicaid insured patients with type-2 diabetes newly starting oral antidiabetic medication. A total of 1,527 African-American patients newly starting antidiabetic medication between July 2001 and June 2002 were compared with 1,128 white patients and 514 patients of other race. Medication adherence was measured as medication possession ratio using prescription refill patterns. Multivariate regression analyses were used to determine the difference in adherence rates adjusting for other covariates. Results: Medication adherence rate was significantly higher for whites [0.59 (0.31)] as compared to African Americans [0.54 (0.31), (p < 0.05)]. In multivariate analyses, the adherence rate of African-American patients was found to be significantly lower by 12% as compared to whites after adjusting for other covariates. Metformin users were associated with a 62% decrease in adherence rate as compared with the sulfonylureas group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The antidiabetic medication adherence was associated with race. Future research should investigate patient-related factors affecting medication adherence in type-2 diabetes patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The own-race bias (ORB) in face recognition can be interpreted as a failure to generalize expert perceptual encoding developed for own-race faces to other-race faces. Further, black participants appear to use different features to describe faces from those used by white participants (Shepherd & Deregowski, 1981). An experiment is reported where the size of the ORB was assessed using a standard face recognition procedure. Four groups were tested at two time intervals. One group received a training regime involving learning to distinguish faces that varied only on their chin, cheeks, nose, and mouth. Three control groups did not receive this training. The ORB, present prior to training, was reduced after the critical perceptual training. It is concluded that the ORB is a consequence of a failure of attention being directed to those features of other race faces that are useful for identification.

Abstract = {Research over the past two decades has demonstrated that individuals are better at the recognition and discrimination of own- versus other-race faces. Recent evidence, however, supports an own-race effect at the level of perceptual encoding in adults. The current study examines the perceptual basis of the own-race effect in secondary students from two racially segregated communities (White and South Asian). The contact hypothesis is investigated, as other-race experience may influence other-race face perception. Face stimuli were generated by morphing together South Asian and White faces along a linear continuum. In a same/different perceptual discrimination task participants judged whether face stimuli were physically identical to, or different from, the original faces. Results revealed a significant own-race effect for the White participants only, wherein they were better at discriminating White relative to South Asian faces. Other-race individuating experience was found to predict the own-race effect, indicating that other-race experience influences other-race face perceptual expertise.

Abstract = {This article examines associations between the Great Recession and 4 aspects of 9-year olds’ behavior—aggression (externalizing), anxiety/depression (internalizing), alcohol and drug use, and vandalism—using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal birth cohort drawn from 20 U.S. cities (21%, White, 50% Black, 26% Hispanic, and 3% other race/ethnicity). The study was in the field for the 9-year follow-up right before and during the Great Recession (2007-2010; N = 3,311). Interview dates (month) were linked to the national Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI), calculated from a national probability sample drawn monthly to assess consumer confidence and uncertainty about the economy, as well as to data on local unemployment rates. Controlling for city-fixed effects and extensive controls (including prior child behavior at age 5), we find that greater uncertainty as measured by the CSI was associated with higher rates of all 4 behavior problems for boys (in both maternal and child reports). Such associations were not found for girls (all gender differences were significant). Links between the CSI and boys’ behavior problems were concentrated in single-parent families and were partially explained by parenting behaviors. Local unemployment rates, in contrast, had fewer associations with children’s behavior, suggesting that in the Great Recession, what was most meaningful for child behavior problems was the uncertainty about the national economy, rather than local labor markets.

Abstract = {Fifty years have elapsed since Cantril (1965) published his work on The Pattern of Human Concerns. His line of inquiry has stood the test of time. In late 2012, the nationally representative South African Social Attitudes Survey replicated Cantril’s 1960s questions and methodology to elicit South Africans’ hopes and aspirations and worries and fears for self and country and their ratings of where self and country stood—past, present and will stand in future. Although Cantril’s ‘ladder-of life’ scale is still regularly used as a measure of subjective well-being, to our knowledge his full line of preliminary questioning has not been fielded again to date. Our study found that South African aspirations for self were mainly material ones for a decent standard of living and the means to achieve this goal. Hopes for the nation concentrated on economic and political progress to consolidate South Africa’s democracy. A large number of personal and national hopes were mirrored in fears that these aspirations might not be met. Cantril’s method also allowed us to review the main concerns and ratings across the diverse groups of citizens that make up the ‘rainbow nation’. There was a substantial degree of consensus on top hopes and fears but levels of standing on the Cantril ladder of life were still graded according to apartheidera inequalities with black South Africans scoring lower than other race groups. Nonetheless, the majority of South Africans rated their present life better than 5 years ago and projected life to get better in future. Such optimism may place considerable pressure on the state to deliver on personal and societal hopes as the country enters its third decade of democracy.

Abstract = {This research used an Implicit Racial Bias Test to investigate implicit racial biases among 3‐ to 5‐year‐olds and adult participants in China (N = 213) and Cameroon (N = 257). In both cultures, participants displayed high levels of racial biases that remained stable between 3 and 5 years of age. Unlike adults, young children's implicit racial biases were unaffected by the social status of the other‐race groups. Also, unlike adults, young children displayed overt explicit racial biases, and these biases were dissociated from their implicit biases. The results provide strong evidence for the early emergence of implicit racial biases and point to the need to reduce them in early childhood.

Abstract = {Faces are processed holistically, so selective attention to 1 face part without any influence of the others often fails. In this study, 3 experiments investigated what type of facial information (shape or surface) underlies holistic face processing and whether generalization of holistic processing to nonexperienced faces requires extensive discrimination experience. Results show that facial shape information alone is sufficient to elicit the composite face effect (CFE), 1 of the most convincing demonstrations of holistic processing, whereas facial surface information is unnecessary (Experiment 1). The CFE is eliminated when faces differ only in surface but not shape information, suggesting that variation of facial shape information is necessary to observe holistic face processing (Experiment 2). Removing 3-dimensional (3D) facial shape information also eliminates the CFE, indicating the necessity of 3D shape information for holistic face processing (Experiment 3). Moreover, participants show similar holistic processing for faces with and without extensive discrimination experience (i.e., own- and other-race faces), suggesting that generalization of holistic processing to nonexperienced faces requires facial shape information, but does not necessarily require further individuation experience. These results provide compelling evidence that facial shape information underlies holistic face processing. This shape-based account not only offers a consistent explanation for previous studies of holistic face processing, but also suggests a new ground—in addition to expertise—for the generalization of holistic processing to different types of faces and to nonface objects.

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that same-race (SR) faces are processed more holistically than other-race (OR) faces, a difference that may underlie the greater difficulty at recognizing OR than SR faces (the "other-race effect"). This article provides original evidence suggesting that the holistic processing of faces may be sensitive to the observers' racial categorization of the face. In Experiment 1, Caucasian participants performed a face-composite task with Caucasian faces, Asian faces, and racially ambiguous morphed face stimuli. Identical morphed face stimuli were processed more holistically when categorized as SR than as OR faces. Experiment 2 further suggests that this finding was not underlain by strategic or training effects. Overall, these results support the view that one's categorization of a face as belonging to the same or another race plays a critical role in the holistic processing of this face.

Abstract = {A series of experiments investigated the effect of speakers' language, accent, and race on children's social preferences. When presented with photographs and voice recordings of novel children, 5-year-old children chose to be friends with native speakers of their native language rather than foreign-language or foreign-accented speakers. These preferences were not exclusively due to the intelligibility of the speech, as children found the accented speech to be comprehensible, and did not make social distinctions between foreign-accented and foreign-language speakers. Finally, children chose same-race children as friends when the target children were silent, but they chose other-race children with a native accent when accent was pitted against race. A control experiment provided evidence that children's privileging of accent over race was not due to the relative familiarity of each dimension. The results, discussed in an evolutionary framework, suggest that children preferentially evaluate others along dimensions that distinguished social groups in prehistoric human societies.

Abstract = {Accusations of discriminatory treatment of minority persons in the criminal justice system create a need for policy and procedure development to create real and perceived equal treatment. A facial recognition deficit among law enforcement officers and witnesses for persons of another "race" contributes to unequal treatment of minority group members. This article demonstrates the other-race effect in an unusual context, reveals theoretical weaknesses, reveals the role of categorical processes in the phenomenon, and discusses policy implications. Experiment 1, based on feature and trait ratings, demonstrates that identical and racially ambiguous faces with different racial markers (hair) are perceived according to the marker. Experiment 2 demonstrates an other-race recognition effect using these faces. A feature acting as a racial marker can cause a face to be perceived and remembered differently. Other-race faces are perceived categorically, which drives the recognition process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Previous research suggests that females may be more motivated to smoke for negative reinforcement (NR) than males. However, it remains unclear whether gender differences in smoking outcome expectancies for negative smoking reinforcement—an important theoretical and clinical target defined as beliefs that smoking alleviates negative affect—exist above and beyond gender differences in depression and/or other outcome expectancies. Methods: Relations between gender and negative smoking reinforcement expectancies were examined in two independent samples. Sample 1 consisted of non-treatment seeking daily smokers (Male n = 188; Female n = 91) recruited from Southern California (49.5% Black, 32.2% Caucasian, and 18.3% other race/ethnicity). Sample 2 consisted of treatment seeking daily smokers (Male n = 257; Female n = 237) in Northern Florida and Vermont (10.7% Black, 82.9% Caucasian, and 6.4% other). Results: Females (vs. males) reported stronger NR smoking expectancies with and without statistically controlling for nicotine dependence, other smoking expectancies, and anxiety and depression in both samples (βs = .06 to .14, ps = .06 to < .001). Conclusions: Beliefs that smoking alleviates negative affect may reflect a gender-specific etiological process disproportionately prominent in women. Enhancing ability to cope with negative affect without smoking or challenge NR expectancies may be particularly important for cessation treatment in women.

Abstract = {A large percentage of people recently exonerated by DNA evidence were imprisoned on the basis of faulty eyewitness identification. Many of these cases involved victims and suspects of different races. Two studies examined the recognition of Hispanic and Black target faces by Hispanic participants under nonoptimal viewing conditions. When viewing time decreased, recognition performance for same- and other-race faces systematically shifted downward. Recognition accuracy for faces of both races decreased under conditions of high negative arousal and attention load; however, recognition of same-race faces was differentially affected by attention distractors. Face recognition accuracy was not affected by a delay between initial presentation of the faces and the face recognition test. An understanding of how recognition of other-race persons differs from that of same-race persons can assist by reducing misidentifications and ensuring that the perpetrator rather than an innocent person is imprisoned.

Data were analyzed from 39 research articles, involving 91 independent samples and nearly 5,000 participants. Measures of hit and false alarm rates, and aggregate measures of discrimination accuracy and response criterion were examined, including an analysis of 8 study moderators. Several theoretical relationships were also assessed (i.e., the influence of racial attitudes and interracial contact). Overall, results indicated a "mirror effect" pattern in which own-race faces yielded a higher proportion of hits and a lower proportion of false alarms compared with other-race faces. Consistent with this effect, a significant ORB was also found in aggregate measures of discrimination accuracy and response criterion. The influence of perceptual learning and differentiation processes in the ORB are discussed, in addition to the practical implications of this phenomenon.

Abstract = {Discusses the authors' discovery of a perceptual effect while developing a stimulus set to examine the cross-race face-recognition deficit. The cross-race effect occurs when people of one race have greater difficulty recognizing individuals of another race. One problem with research on the cross-race effect can be attributed to differential experience with members of the various racial stimulus classes due to social contact or due to perceptual expertise. The authors found that categorization of race plays a substantial role in the perception and representation of faces. When a key feature acting as a racial marker is present, it causes a face to be categorized as one race or another, thereby altering perception of the face as consistent with other exemplars from the categorized race. Furthermore, categorization appears to alter the storage and representation of individual characteristics that enable the face the be subsequently recognized. This ambiguous-race face illusion suggests that other-race faces are processed differently from same-race faces as a result of the categorization process. This categorization process may explain why people are less able to recognize faces of another race. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Race categorization of faces is a fast and automatic process and is known to affect further face processing profoundly and at earliest stages. Whether processing of own- and other-race faces might rely on different facial cues, as indicated by diverging viewing behavior, is much under debate. We therefore aimed to investigate two open questions in our study: (1) Do observers consider information from distinct facial features informative for race categorization or do they prefer to gain global face information by fixating the geometrical center of the face? (2) Does the fixation pattern, or, if facial features are considered relevant, do these features differ between own- and other-race faces? We used eye tracking to test where European observers look when viewing Asian and Caucasian faces in a race categorization task. Importantly, in order to disentangle centrally located fixations from those towards individual facial features, we presented faces in frontal, half-profile and profile views. We found that observers showed no general bias towards looking at the geometrical center of faces, but rather directed their first fixations towards distinct facial features, regardless of face race. However, participants looked at the eyes more often in Caucasian faces than in Asian faces, and there were significantly more fixations to the nose for Asian compared to Caucasian faces. Thus, observers rely on information from distinct facial features rather than facial information gained by centrally fixating the face. To what extent specific features are looked at is determined by the face’s race. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Selective sensitization has been proposed as an alternative explanation for enhanced responding to animal fear‐relevant stimuli—snakes and spiders—during extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning. The current study sought to replicate the phenomenon using a shock workup procedure as the sensitizing manipulation and to extend it to interpersonal and intergroup fear‐relevant stimuli—angry faces and other‐race faces. Assessment of selective sensitization was followed by a one‐trial fear learning procedure. Selective sensitization, larger electrodermal responses to fear‐relevant than to control stimuli after sensitization, or a larger increase in electrodermal responding to fear‐relevant than to control stimuli after sensitization was observed across stimulus domains. However, the one‐trial fear learning procedure failed to provide evidence for enhanced fear conditioning to fear‐relevant stimuli. One‐trial fear learning was either absent or present for fear‐relevant and nonfear‐relevant stimuli. The current study confirms that electrodermal responses to fear‐relevant stimuli across stimulus domains are subject to selective sensitization.

Abstract = {Objective Economic burden on families coping with end‐stage cancer remains poorly understood. Advanced malignancy threatens financial stability of families, and interventions are needed to buffer them from impoverishment. This study examined the relationship between subjective and objective assessments of financial burden on families (financial strain and stress, respectively) and identified potentially modifiable factors to inform intervention efforts. Methods Using national survey data, we analyzed responses from households that had recently experienced a cancer death; 176 of households provided information on financial strain, and 158 provided data on financial stress. In addition to self‐reported appraisals of financial burden, measures assessed elements of the cancer care experience, treatment, symptom burden, work impact, insurance coverage, and demographics. Results Despite being well insured, approximately a quarter of respondents reported that the cost of care was a major financial burden, and a third used all or most of their savings. Financial strain and stress were moderately positively correlated (r = 0.46, p < 0.01). Higher financial stress scores were negatively correlated with decedent's age at death (r = −0.34, p < 0.01), and minority respondents (‘other’ race) reported much higher financial stress (M = 4.7; SD = 3.2) than White (M = 0.8; SD = 1.4) or Black (M = 1.6; SD = 2.2) respondents (p < 0.001). Financial burden was also associated with no or limited insurance coverage, changes in employment, severe pain and nausea, and provider interactions during the cancer care experience (e.g., whether the MD paid attention to non‐medical factors or having unanswered questions about medications) (p < 0.05 for all). Conclusions The cancer care experience, symptoms, and work impact were associated with financial burden and have important implications for research and practice.

Abstract = {Depression rates rise in adolescence and the prevalence of depression is higher among Latino adolescents than other race/ethnic groups. Ethnic density among immigrant populations is associated with better health and mental health outcomes among adults, but little is known about its effects among adolescents or its mechanisms. This study examines the pathways by which immigrant density may affect mental health outcomes among Latino youth. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we drew a sample of 2,678 Hispanic youth. Multivariate multilevel logistic regression analyses found that Latino immigrant density predicted lower odds of depression among both male and female immigrant but not non-immigrant Latino adolescents. No mediating effects of neighborhood efficacy, perceived safety or perceived contentment were observed in this study. Results reaffirm the need to further explore the mechanisms through which ethnic density exerts its salubrious effect on immigrant youth mental health.

Abstract = {Religiosity and spirituality are often integral facets of human development. Young gay and bisexual men (YGBM), however, may find themselves at odds when attempting to reconcile potentially conflicting identities like religion and their sexual orientation. We sought to explore how different components of religiosity (participation, commitment, spiritual coping) are linked to different markers of psychological well-being (life purpose, self-esteem, and internalized homophobia). Using data collected in Metro Detroit (N = 351 ages 18-29 years; 47 % African American, 29 % Non-Latino White, 8 % Latino, 16 % Other Race), we examined how components of religiosity/spirituality were associated with psychological well-being among religious/spiritual-identified participants. An overwhelming majority (79.5 %) identified as religious/spiritual, with most YGBM (91.0 %) reporting spirituality as a coping source. Over three quarters of our religious/spiritual sample (77.7 %) reported attending a religious service in the past year. Religious participation and commitment were negatively associated with psychological well-being. Conversely, spiritual coping was positively associated with YGBM’s psychological well-being. Programs assisting YGBM navigate multiple/conflicting identities through sexuality-affirming resources may aid improve of their psychological well-being. We discuss the public health potential of increasing sensitivity to the religious/spiritual needs of YGBM across social service organizations.

Abstract = {Diabetes knows no age and affects millions of individuals. Preventing diabetes in children is increasingly becoming a major health policy concern and focus. The objective of this study is to project the number of children, aged 0–17 years, with diagnosed diabetes in the United States through 2030, accounting for changing demography, and diabetes and obesity prevalence rates. The study team combined historic diabetes and obesity prevalence data with US child population estimates and projections. A times-series regression model was used to forecast future diabetes prevalence and to account for the relationship between the forecasted diabetes prevalence and the lagged prevalence of childhood obesity. Overall, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes is projected to increase 67% from 0.22% in 2010 to 0.36% in 2030. Lagged obesity prevalence in Hispanic boys and non-Hispanic black girls was significantly associated with increasing future diabetes prevalence. The study results showed that a 1% increase in obesity prevalence among Hispanic boys from the previous year was significantly associated with a 0.005% increase in future prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in children (P ≤ 0.01). Likewise, a unit increase in obesity prevalence among non-Hispanic black girls was associated with a 0.003% increase in future diabetes prevalence (P < 0.05). Obesity rates for other race/ethnicity combinations were not associated with increasing future diabetes prevalence. To mitigate the continued threat posed by diabetes, serious discussions need to focus on the pediatric population, particularly non-Hispanic black girls and Hispanic boys whose obesity trends show the strongest associations with future diabetes prevalence in children.

Abstract = {Latinos have lower colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) and survival rates compared to other race/ethnic groups. This cross-sectional study examines relationships between acculturation, access to and utilization of healthcare services, and CRCS in low-income Latinos. Bilingual data collectors conducted structured interviews with 544 Latino men and women (> 50 years) residing in the Texas-Mexico border area. Using a hierarchical logistic regression model, we examined the relationship between lifetime history of any CRCS test and indicators of acculturation, healthcare utilization and access to care, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics. Survey results revealed a 34 % prevalence of CRCS. Participants reporting a provider recommendation for screening, regular check-ups, higher acculturation level, and health insurance had significantly increased odds of CRCS. Findings indicate CRCS intervention research in Latinos should focus on (1) increasing physicians’ recommendations for screening, (2) promoting regular check-ups, (3) and increasing CRC prevention efforts on less acculturated and uninsured groups.

Abstract = {This study examines associations between maternal and paternal mental health and child bullying perpetration among school-age children, and whether having one or both parents with suboptimal mental health is associated with bullying. The 2007 National Survey of Children’s Health, a nationally-representative, random-digit-dial survey, was analyzed, using a parent-reported bullying measure. Suboptimal mental health was defined as fair/poor (vs. good/very good/excellent) parental self-reported mental and emotional health. Of the 61,613 parents surveyed, more than half were parents of boys and were white, 20 % were Latino, 15 % African American, and 7 % other race/ethnicity. Suboptimal maternal (OR 1.4; 95 % CI 1.1–1.8) and paternal (OR 1.5; 95 % CI 1.1–2.2) mental health are associated with bullying. Compared with children with no parents with suboptimal mental health, children with only one or both parents with suboptimal mental health have higher bullying odds. Addressing the mental health of both parents may prove beneficial in preventing bullying. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Racial primes are an outgrowth and inculcation of a well-structured, highly developed, racially conservative, "race-neutral" or "color-blind" racial socialization process in which children learn race-specific stereotypes about African Americans and other race/ethnic groups. As they get older, they continue to receive--both involuntary and voluntary--corroborating messages of anti-Black stereotypes from adults, friends, games, folklore, music, television, popular media, and the hidden curriculum. A result of this belief system is Black misandry. Black misandry refers to an exaggerated pathological aversion toward Black men created and reinforced in societal, institutional, and individual ideologies, practices, and behaviors. Findings: Through the use of focus group interview data from African American male students at four universities, it reveals that potent Black misandric beliefs exist in both academic and social spaces in the collegiate environment. Conclusions: Using critical race theory as a framework, the counterstory in this article provides an interpretation of how racially primed Black misandric beliefs influence the collegiate racial climate and how educational administrator might respond.

Early literacy skills are intertwined with the acquisition of early numeracy skills, particularly at the informal numeracy and numeral knowledge phases.

To address this issue, 180 preschool children 3.13 to 5.88 years (51.1% female, 66.7% Caucasian, 14.4% African-American, 4.4% Hispanic, 14.4% other race/ethnicity) were assessed on measures of print knowledge, vocabulary, informal numeracy, and numeral knowledge. Results indicated that the relation between language and numeral knowledge is fully mediated by informal numeracy skills and the relation between informal numeracy skills and numeral knowledge skills is partially mediated by print knowledge.

Abstract = {Neighborhood context plays a role in the development of adolescent health risk behaviors, but few studies have investigated the influence of neighborhoods on the perpetration of dating violence. This longitudinal study examined the direct effects of risky neighborhood structural and physical characteristics on trajectories of the perpetration of dating violence, tested whether collective efficacy mediated these relationships, and determined if the effects varied by the sex of the adolescent. Adolescent data are from a multi-wave longitudinal study from grades 8 to 12; neighborhood data were collected from parents’ interviews and U.S. Census data. Multilevel growth curve models were conducted with 3,218 students; the sample was 50 % male, 41 % White, 50 % Black, and 9 % other race/ethnicity. In models examining risky neighborhood variables one at a time, and controlling for potential individual-level confounders, the sex of the adolescent interacted with economic disadvantage, residential instability, and physical disorder; these risky neighborhood characteristics increased risk for girls’ but not boys’ perpetrating of dating violence. In full models with all of the risky neighborhood variables, the sex of the adolescent continued to interact with neighborhood economic disadvantage; living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods increased girls’ but not boys’ risk for dating violence across all ages. No other risky neighborhood effects were found for boys or girls. Collective efficacy did not mediate the relationships between other neighborhood characteristics and the outcome. These findings suggest that dating violence prevention strategies for girls should consider the contexts in which they live rather than only targeting changes in their individual characteristics.

Abstract = {Background: Few studies have assessed sex or racial/ethnic differences in inpatient experiences in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. Objectives: This study aimed to compare inpatient experiences by sex and race/ethnicity within and between VA hospitals. Research Design: We used mixed-effects multinomial regression to assess within-facility and between-facility sex and racial/ethnic differences in the 2010 VA Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients. Subjects: 50,471 respondents from 144 VA hospitals (4.5% female; 75.4% non-Hispanic white, 14.7% non-Hispanic black, 5.4% Hispanic, and 4.4% other race/ethnicity). Measures: Negative and positive patient-reported experiences in 13 health care domains were included. Results: Adjusted within-facility sex differences indicated that women reported more negative and less positive experiences than men in 4 domains, and less negative and more positive experiences on domains related to noise and privacy. Patients at facilities with more female patients reported more negative and less positive experiences in 4 domains. Blacks and Hispanics reported less negative and/or more positive experiences than whites within the same facility, although patients at facilities with more black and Hispanic patients reported more negative and less positive experiences overall. There were few and inconsistent within-facility differences between other racial/ethnic patients and whites. Patients at facilities with more other racial/ethnic patients reported slightly less negative and more positive experiences. Conclusions: Male, black, and Hispanic patients treated in VA hospitals tend to report more positive experiences than female and white patients treated at the same facilities. However, less positive experiences are reported by patients overall in hospitals that serve larger populations of women and racial/ethnic minorities.

Most researchers agree that this effect results from differential experience with same-race (SR) and other-race (OR) faces. However, the specific processes that develop with visual experience and underlie the other-race effect remain to be clarified. We tested whether the integration of facial features into a whole representation-- holistic processing--was larger for SR than OR faces in Caucasians and Asians without life experience with OR faces. For both classes of participants, recognition of the upper half of a composite-face stimulus was more disrupted by the bottom half (the composite-face effect) for SR than OR faces, demonstrating that SR faces are processed more holistically than OR faces. This differential holistic processing for faces of different races, probably a byproduct of visual experience, may be a critical factor in the other-race effect.

Abstract = {Objective: Research on the accuracy of self-reported weight has indicated that the degree of misreporting (underestimating) weight is associated with increasing weight but is variable across patient groups. We examined the degree of discrepancy between actual and self-reported BMI in severely obese bariatric surgery candidates, and whether the degree of accuracy varied by race and by eating-related and psychological factors. Research Methods and Procedures: Participants were 179 obese female gastric bypass surgery candidates (31 black, 22 Hispanic, 126 white) who were asked to self-report height and weight as part of a larger assessment battery. Actual height and weight were then measured and a discrepancy score was generated (actual BMI-reported BMI). Results: In this group of severely obese patients, degree of misreporting was unrelated to BMI. The race groups did not differ in actual or self-reported BMI but differed significantly in the degree of misestimation between self-reported and actual BMI. Post hoc tests indicated that black women underestimated their BMI significantly more than white women; Hispanic women did not differ from the other race groups. No eating-related or psychological variables assessed predicted percentage discrepancy; however, the accuracy in self-reported weight was related to history of weight cycling. Discussion: Overall, obese bariatric surgery candidates were accurate in self-report of weight, although the degree of accuracy differed by race and weight cycling history.

Abstract = {Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for the difficulty in recognizing faces of other racial groups (the other-race effect; ORE): perceptual expertise and social cognitive factors. Focusing on the social cognitive factors alone, we manipulated in-group and out-group memberships based on two social categories (nationality and university affiliation), and controlled for perceptual expertise by testing Caucasian participants with Caucasian faces only. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) and focusing on the N170, a brain electrical component sensitive to faces, we provide for the first time strong support for the social cognitive influence on face processing within 200 ms. After participants learned the social categories, the N170 latency differentiated between double in-group and double out-group faces, taking longer to process the latter. In comparison, without group memberships, there was no difference in N170 latency among the faces. These results are consistent with recent findings of behavioral and imaging research, providing further support for the social cognitive model and its potential for understanding ORE.

Abstract = {One response to the recurring crises arising out of police use of force incidents is the establishment of procedures to review allegations of police misconduct. These procedures and their outcomes, however, often become ensnared in controversy themselves. In particular, accusations regarding the impact of race often play a significant role. To ascertain the role of race and other factors in the disposition of complaints against police, this study examines allegations of excessive use of nondeadly force by Chicago police officers. Using models from social psychology, numerous dimensions regarding complaints of police brutality and the investigation of those complaints are tested to determine their impact on complaint disposition. Two variables - evidence and duty status - have widespread significance in these models. The only significant racial effect in any of the models is the interactive variable reflecting the race of the investigator and the race of the complainant. Investigators of both races - African American and Caucasian American - when deciding a case involving a complainant of the other race, were less likely to make a definitive, negative judgment about the complaint than when the complainant was of the same race. The pattern of findings seems to support the hypothesis which states that the social situation of the decision maker may inhibit the impact of stereotypes.

Abstract = {This article investigates patterns of spatial assimilation of Hispanics in U.S. metropolitan areas. Using restricted-use data from the 2000 Census, we calculate Hispanics' levels of residential segregation by race and nativity and then estimate multivariate models to examine the association of group characteristics with these patterns. To obtain a more nuanced view of spatial assimilation, we use alternative reference groups in the segregation calculations—Anglos, African Americans, and Hispanics not of the same race. We find that Hispanics experience multiple and concurrent forms of spatial assimilation across generations: U.S.-born White, Black, and other-race Hispanics tend to be less segregated from Anglos, African Americans, and U.S.-born Hispanics not of the same race than are the foreign-born of the respective groups. We find some exceptions, suggesting that race continues to influence segregation despite the general strength of assimilation-related factors: Black Hispanics display high levels of segregation from Anglos, and U.S.-born Black Hispanics are no less segregated from other Hispanic groups than are their foreign-born counterparts.

Abstract = {Adults are sensitive to the physical differences that define ethnic groups. However, the age at which we become sensitive to ethnic differences is currently unclear. Our study aimed to clarify this by testing newborns and young infants for sensitivity to ethnicity using a visual preference (VP) paradigm. While newborn infants demonstrated no spontaneous preference for faces from either their own- or other-ethnic groups, 3-month-old infants demonstrated a significant preference for faces from their own-ethnic group. These results suggest that preferential selectivity based on ethnic differences is not present in the first days of life, but is learned within the first 3 months of life. The findings imply that adults' perceptions of ethnic differences are learned and derived from differences in exposure to own- versus other-race faces during early development.

Abstract = {Objective: To determine if racial and ethnic variations exist in intensive care (ICU) use during terminal hospitalizations, and, if variations do exist, to determine whether they can be explained by systematic differences in hospital utilization by race/ethnicity. Data Source: 1999 hospital discharge data from all nonfederal hospitals in Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. Design: We identified all terminal admissions (N = 192,705) among adults. We calculated crude rates of ICU use among non-Hispanic whites, blacks, Hispanics, and those with "other" race/ethnicity. We performed multivariable logistic regression on ICU use, with and without adjustment for clustering of patients within hospitals, to calculate adjusted differences in ICU use and by race/ethnicity. We explored both a random-effects (RE) and fixed-effect (FE) specification to adjust for hospital-level clustering. DATA Data Collection: The data were collected by each state. Principal Findings: ICU use during the terminal hospitalization was highest among nonwhites, varying from 64.4 percent among Hispanics to 57.5 percent among whites. Compared to white women, the risk-adjusted odds of ICU use was higher for white men and for nonwhites of both sexes (odds ratios [ORs] and 95 percent confidence intervals: white men = 1.16 (1.14-1.19), black men = 1.35 (1.17-1.56), Hispanic men = 1.52 (1.27-1.82), black women = 1.31 (1.25-1.37), Hispanic women =1.53 (1.43-1.63)). Additional adjustment for within-hospital clustering of patients using the RE model did not change the estimate for white men, but markedly attenuated observed differences for blacks (OR for men =1.12 (0.96-1.31), women = 1.10 (1.03-1.17)) and Hispanics (OR for men =1.19 (1.00-1.42), women = 1.18 (1.09-1.27)). Results from the FE model were similar to the RE model (OR for black men = 1.10 (0.95-1.28), black women = 1.07 (1.02-1.13) Hispanic men = 1.17 (0.96-1.42), and Hispanic women = 1.14 (1.06-1.24)) Conclusions: The majority of observed differences in terminal ICU use among blacks and Hispanics were attributable to their use of hospitals with higher ICU use rather than to racial differences in ICU use within the same hospital.

Abstract = {Members of one race often have great difficulty in identifying members from another race. This is referred to as the cross-race effect (CRE). The basis of the CRE is not fully understood despite 30 years of research (Meissner & Brigham, 2001). A recent explanation for the CRE is the perceptual expertise hypothesis which posits that people of another race comprise an unfamiliar stimulus class, thus are more difficult to encode and remember. Another explanation for the CRE is the utilitarian hypothesis. The utilitarian hypothesis posits that people must have a need to individuate members of another race; contact is not enough. The research presented here further examines the basis for the CRE. Experiment one examined the perceptual expertise hypothesis by presenting faces in both an upright and inverted orientation and found that inversion disrupts same-race faces, not other-race faces. Experiment two was designed to replicate and extend experiment one by examining the utilitarian hypothesis as an explanation of the CRE. Experiment one was replicated, and it was found that participants classified as 'experts' in recognizing African American basketball players and recalling the names of famous African American people may have adopted a different cognitive processing strategy when recognizing both same- and other-race faces than did those classified as 'novices.'

Abstract = {Purpose: Showups are common, yet little research has investigated the biasing factors that may influence showup identifications. We investigated the effects of cross‐race conditions and clothing bias on showup identification decisions. Additionally, we explored identification decisions made in a subsequent lineup dependent on race, clothing, and showup‐target‐presence. Methods: Participants watched a mock crime and were presented with a showup in which suspect race, target‐presence, and the clothing worn by the suspect were varied. Following a delay, participants viewed a target‐present or ‐absent lineup and were asked to make a second identification decision. Results: Presentation of the suspect in the clothing worn by the perpetrator increased choosing rates in both own‐race and other‐race conditions. Despite this, differential patterns of decision response latencies indicated that eyewitnesses may use clothing information differently when making own‐race compared to other‐race identification decisions. No evidence for an own‐race bias in showup identifications was found; however, other‐race lineup identifications were less accurate than own‐race lineup identifications. Further, participants in own‐race and other‐race conditions differed in the extent to which they were affected by multiple identification procedures. Viewing an own‐race innocent suspect in a showup increased subsequent false lineup identifications, while choosing the innocent suspect from the showup was necessary to increase false lineup identifications in other‐race conditions. Conclusions: Different situational factors may affect the identification accuracy of eyewitnesses in own‐race and other‐race conditions for both showup and lineup procedures. Particular caution is advised when showups are clothing‐biased and multiple identification procedures are used. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the role of name labels in facial recognition, arguing that the function of a proper name is to direct the level of specificity at which a face is perceived. First, we discuss the expertise hypothesis of face recognition in which the face is identified at the specific, subordinate level of the individual. This research has important implications with respect to how a name label affects the recognition of a face stimulus. Next, we consider evidence from neurophysiological research revealing how names facilitate the familiarity, categorization and individuation of a face as measured by event-related potentials (ERPs). We examine results from studies of perceptual expertise and the other-race effects (OREs) that suggest formation and retrieval of face representations are heavily dependent on name labels. In light of these findings, we propose the function of a proper name is to direct visual attention to the most subordinate-level category associated with the individuated identity of a face. The uniqueness of the proper name label dictates that the representation mediating face recognition will be a highly detailed, perceptual description of the person.

Abstract = {Introduction: Monitoring the level of asthma control is important in determining the effectiveness of current treatment which may decrease the frequency and intensity of symptoms and functional limitations. Uncontrolled asthma has been associated with decreased quality of life and increased health care use. The objectives of this study were to assess the level of asthma control and identify related risk factors among persons with current asthma. Methods: Using the 2006 to 2010 BRFSS child and adult Asthma Call-back Survey, asthma control was classified as well-controlled or uncontrolled (not-well-controlled or very-poorly-controlled) using three impairment measures: daytime symptoms, night-time symptoms, and taking short-acting β2-agonists for symptom control. Multivariate logistic regression identified predictors of asthma control. Results: Fifty percent of adults and 38.4% of children with current asthma had uncontrolled asthma. About 63% of children and 53% of adults with uncontrolled asthma were on long-term asthma control medications. Among children, uncontrolled asthma was significantly associated with being younger than 5 years, having annual household income < $15 000, and reporting cost as barriers to medical care. Among adults, it was significantly associated with being 45 years or older, having annual household income of < $25 000, being "other" race, having less than a 4-year college degree, being a current or former smoker, reporting cost as barriers, being obese, and having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or depression. Conclusion: Identifying and targeting modifiable predictors of uncontrolled asthma (low educational attainment, low income, cigarette smoking, and co-morbid conditions including obesity and depression) could improve asthma control.

Research design: A secondary data analysis of the Arizona Trauma Database consisting of 18 868 cases of TBI between 2008–2010 was conducted. Methods and procedures: The sample consisted of patients who ranged in age from 0–79 and were White, Black, Native American, Asian or other race. Cross-tabulations, chi-squares and a logistic regression were conducted. Main outcomes and results: Standardized residuals indicated that Native Americans and Blacks were more likely to experience violent TBI, regardless of gender or age group (p < 0.01). The logistic regression indicated that Native Americans (OR = 3.13), Blacks (OR = 1.95) and other race (OR = 1.56) patients had statistically significantly (p < 0.001) higher odds of experiencing violent TBI compared to Whites. In addition, females (OR = 0.40), children (OR = 0.75) and older adults (OR = 0.17) had statistically significantly (p < 0.001) lower odds of violent TBI.

Abstract = {Although ostracism is a powerfully aversive experience, recent evidence identifies factors capable of moderating the impact of ostracism, such as in-group status and the group’s essential nature. In the current work, 67 Caucasian American participants (47 women) were included or ostracized by either same-race (i.e., Caucasian American) or other-race (i.e., African American) targets on a between-subjects basis while playing the game Cyberball. Participants then indicated the extent to which they felt similar to the other Cyberball players as well as how satisfied their basic needs (e.g., belongingness, self-esteem) were during the game. Consistent with past research, we found that in-group and out-group status moderated the magnitude of reactions to social inclusion and ostracism; that is, ostracism hurts more and social inclusion feels better when it is implemented by fellow in-group as opposed to out-group members. Importantly, we extend these previous findings by demonstrating that differential reactions to social inclusion and ostracism are mediated by changes in participants’ self-perceived similarity with in-group members. These results identify a potential mechanism responsible for the differential impact of in-group–out-group status on reactions to social inclusion and ostracism.

Is the in-group favouritism in empathic neural responses specific to race identification or a more general effect of social identification—including those based on religious/irreligious beliefs? The present study investigated whether and how intergroup relationships based on religious/irreligious identifications modulate empathic neural responses to others’ pain expressions. We recorded event-related brain potentials from Chinese Christian and atheist participants while they perceived pain or neutral expressions of Chinese faces that were marked as being Christians or atheists. We found that both Christian and atheist participants showed stronger neural activity to pain (versus neutral) expressions at 132–168 ms and 200–320 ms over the frontal region to those with the same (versus different) religious/irreligious beliefs. The in-group favouritism in empathic neural responses was also evident in a later time window (412–612 ms) over the central/parietal regions in Christian but not in atheist participants. Our results indicate that the intergroup relationship based on shared beliefs, either religious or irreligious, can lead to in-group favouritism in empathy for others’ suffering.

Data were collected from 1,661 to 1,718 adolescents participating in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, who were diverse in terms of sex (51 % male, 49 % female), race/ethnicity (48 % Hispanic, 34 % African American, 14 % Caucasian, and 4 % other race/ethnicity), and age (mean age 12 years; range 8–16). Information on neighborhood collective efficacy was obtained from adult residents, and data from the 1990 US. Census were used to control for neighborhood disadvantage. Based on hierarchical modeling techniques to adjust for the clustered data, Bernoulli models indicated that more exposure to violence was associated with a greater likelihood of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use and perpetration of violence. Poisson models suggested that victimization was also related to a greater variety of substance use and violent behaviors. A moderating effect of collective efficacy was found in models assessing the variety of substance use; the relationship between victimization and substance use was weaker for youth in neighborhoods with higher versus lower levels of collective efficacy. These findings are consistent with literature indicating that social support can ameliorate the negative impact of victimization. This investigation extends this research to show that neighborhood social support can also help to promote resiliency among adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Purpose: This study describes the lifetime prevalence of teen dating violence (TDV) perpetration in a sample of middle school students from high-risk urban communities and examines the relation between TDV and related cognitive and behavioral risk factors. Methods: Surveys were administered to 2,895 middle school students in four U.S. cities; 1,673 students (58%) reported having dated and were included in analyses. The sample was 52.3% female, 48.2% non-Hispanic black/African-American, 38.2% Hispanic, 4.8% non-Hispanic white, and 7.6% other race. Six types of TDV perpetration were assessed: threatening behaviors, verbal/emotional abuse, relational abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and stalking. Results: Of the students who had dated, 77% reported perpetrating verbal/emotional abuse, 32% reported perpetrating physical abuse, 20% reported threatening a partner, 15% reported perpetrating sexual abuse, 13% reported perpetrating relational abuse, and 6% reported stalking. Girls were more likely than boys to report perpetrating threatening behaviors, verbal/emotional abuse, and physical abuse, and boys were more likely to report perpetrating sexual abuse. Involvement in bullying positively predicted perpetration of TDV, albeit, in different ways for boys and girls. Other risk factors differed by sex. For instance, alcohol use and sex initiation predicted multiple forms of TDV perpetration for boys, whereas weapon carrying and emotional symptoms predicted several forms of TDV perpetration for girls. Conclusions: The prevalence of TDV was high in our sample. Important sex differences in rates of perpetration and risk factors emerged. Comprehensive prevention programs that target TDV and related risk factors, such as bullying and other risk factors, seem warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: We assessed the feasibility of collecting race/ethnicity data from patients using their own preferred racial/ethnic terms. Methods: The 424 patients described their race/ethnicity using their own categories, and we compared their descriptions with their responses to the questions (1) "Do you consider yourself Latino or Hispanic?" and (2) "Which category best describes your race?" (7 response options in our computer interview). We also determined patients' preferences between the 2 approaches. Results: The proportions of patients who described themselves with 1, 2, 3, or 4 terms were 46%, 33%, 14%, and 6%, respectively; 2 said only "American" (1%,) and 1 refused to answer (0.5%). The average completion time was 37 ± 17 seconds. Rates of missing values and categorization as "other" race were lower than with the closed questions. Agreement between racial/ethnic categorization with openended and closed responses was 93% (κ=0.88). Latino/Hispanic and multiracial/multiethnic individuals were more likely to prefer using their own categories to describe their race/ethnicity. Conclusions: Collecting race/ethnicity data using patients' own racial/ethnic categories is feasible with the use of computerized systems to capture verbatim responses and results in lower rates of missing and unusable data than do standard questions.

Abstract = {A robust finding in the cross-cultural research is that people's memories for faces of their own race are superior to their memories for other-race faces. However, the mechanisms underlying the own-race effect have not been well defined. In this study, a holistic explanation was examined in which Caucasian and Asian participants were asked to recognize features of Caucasian and Asian faces presented in isolation and in the whole face. The main finding was that Caucasian participants recognized own-race faces more holistically than Asian faces whereas Asian participants demonstrated holistic recognition for both own-race and other-race faces. The differences in holistic recognition between Caucasian and Asian participants mirrored differences in their relative experience with own-race and other-race faces. These results suggest that the own-race effect may arise from the holistic recognition of faces from a highly familiar racial group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Immediately following training and 1 and 5 mo later, trained Ss showed improved recognition when tested with new sets of Japanese faces.

Although the type of current or recent relationship is associated with marital expectations, they do not explain the observed race/ethnic gap in these expectations.

Abstract = {The influence of interviewers' race on skin color classification for 4,559 white and African American survey respondents (aged 21 yrs or older) is explored using data from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality (conducted 1992 to 1994). As hypothesized, bivariate and multivariate results reveal a compelling race-of-the-interviewer effect for both black and white respondents: White interviewers reported the skin tones of black respondents as substantially darker than did black interviewers. In turn, black interviewers categorized the skin tones of white respondents as much lighter than did white interviewers. Results also indicate that interviewers perceived greater variation in the skin tones of same-race respondents than among other-race respondents, suggesting that both black and white Americans exhibit relatively limited ability to carefully distinguish the physical characteristics of other-race persons. Finally, results show that unsuccessful attempts to match interviewers and respondents by race may have the unintended consequence of introducing important attenuating biases into analyses involving skin color.

Abstract = {Contends that failing to recognize or misidentifying someone can have personal and social consequences. The perceiver may suffer feelings of embarrassment or stupidity. The target may feel insulted, stereotyped, or in extreme cases may be falsely identified as a criminal. If the perceiver and the target are of different ethnic groups, misidentification can increase intergroup hostility, stereotyping, and intergroup anxiety. Laboratory and field research demonstrates an own-race bias in recognition accuracy. People are better able to identify members of their own race than members of another race. The significance of own-race bias in the criminal justice system and intergroup contact situations is reviewed, and cognitive and motivational correlates of own-race bias are discussed. Four explanations for this differential recognition effect (attitude, social orientation, difficulty, and experience) are presented. The explanation derived from intergroup contact theory—that differential recognition stems from limited experience with members of other groups—has received weak research support thus far. Greater attention to assessing different types of contact may increase understanding of the ways in which intergroup contact can affect intergroup perceptions.

Previous studies, using self-report measures of prejudice, failed to find a relationship between prejudice and the other-race effect. The authors used an implicit prejudice measure, developed by R. H. Fazio et al (1995), to determine whether implicit prejudice influences the size of the other-race effect. A self-report measure of prejudice, I. Walker's (1994) Attitudes to Asians Scale, was also included to replicate previous results. A group of 30 high prejudice and 30 low prejudice Caucasian participants (aged 17–44 yrs), as determined by the self-report measure, were run through a procedure which assesses implicit prejudice and recognition performance at the same time. Neither implicit nor self-reported prejudice level influenced the size of the other-race effect. Unexpectedly, implicit and self-report prejudice influenced (in opposite ways) recognition of own-race faces. The implications of these results for understanding the other-race effect are discussed.

Abstract = {It is well established that memory is more accurate for own-relative to other-race faces (own-race bias), which has been suggested to result from larger perceptual expertise for own-race faces. Previous studies also demonstrated better memory for own-relative to other-gender faces, which is less likely to result from differences in perceptual expertise, and rather may be related to social in-group vs out-group categorization. We examined neural correlates of the own-gender bias using event-related potentials (ERP). In a recognition memory experiment, both female and male participants remembered faces of their respective own gender more accurately compared with other-gender faces. ERPs during learning yielded significant differences between the subsequent memory effects (subsequently remembered—subsequently forgotten) for own-gender compared with other-gender faces in the occipito-temporal P2 and the central N200, whereas neither later subsequent memory effects nor ERP old/new effects at test reflected a neural correlate of the own-gender bias. We conclude that the own-gender bias is mainly related to study phase processes, which is in line with sociocognitive accounts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

In the article, footnote (a) in Table 3 contained inaccurate information regarding the adjustment for regression models. The correct footnote is provided.] Previous research has shown strong positive associations between physical and psychological health outcomes and being in a committed relationship, such as marriage; however, little research has investigated whether being in a committed relationship is protective for day-to-day health behaviors such as dietary patterns and physical activity. This research examined associations between relationship status and day-to-day health behaviors (e.g., dietary intake, physical activity) and weight status among a diverse cohort of young adults. This cross-sectional study used data from Project EAT-III, a 10-year longitudinal population-based study (N = 1,853) of Midwest young adults. Young adult participants had an average age of 25.3 years, and were 45% male and 55% female. Participants were socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse, including 48.4% White, 18.6% African American, 5.9% Hispanic, 19.6% Asian, 3.3% Native American, and 4.2% mixed or other race/ethnicity. Results indicated that married men were more likely to be overweight/obese (body mass index ≥ 25) compared with single/casually dating and committed dating/engaged men. Married women were more likely to eat breakfast ≥5 times per week compared with women in other relationship categories. No differences were observed in other health behaviors by relationship status. There were no significant interactions by race/ethnicity. Relationship status seems largely unrelated to young adults’ participation in physical activity and dietary behaviors. However, findings suggest that being married may be a risk factor for overweight/obesity in young adult men and may be a protective factor for health-related behaviors associated with overweight/obesity such as breakfast intake for young adult women.

Although the youngest Ss recognized both kinds of faces equally well, recognition accuracy for Caucasian faces was superior to that for Oriental faces among older Ss. Results are interpreted in terms of development of a familiar-face schema that facilitates recognition of exemplars of the more familiar sort of face with increasing age and experience. Males and females recognized faces about equally well up to approximately age 13; at that age a trend appeared for females to be superior to males in recognizing faces. Females at college level were clearly superior to males at recognizing faces. (16 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Many influential models of face recognition postulate specialized expert processes that are engaged when viewing upright, own-race faces, as opposed to a general-purpose recognition route used for nonface objects and inverted or other-race faces. In contrast, others have argued that empirical differences do not stem from qualitatively distinct processing. We offer a potential resolution to this ongoing controversy. We hypothesize that faces engage specialized processes at large sizes only. To test this, we measured recognition efficiencies for a wide range of sizes. Upright face recognition efficiency increased with size. This was not due to better visibility of basic image features at large sizes. We ensured this by calculating efficiency relative to a specialized ideal observer unique to each individual that incorporated size-related changes in visibility and by measuring inverted efficiencies across the same range of face sizes. Inverted face recognition efficiencies did not change with size. A qualitative face inversion effect, defined as the ratio of relative upright and inverted efficiencies, showed a complete lack of inversion effects for small sizes up to 6°. In contrast, significant face inversion effects were found for all larger sizes. Size effects may stem from predominance of larger faces in the overall exposure to faces, which occur at closer viewing distances typical of social interaction. Our results offer a potential explanation for the contradictory findings in the literature regarding the special status of faces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Despite their similarity as visual patterns, we can discriminate and recognize many thousands of faces. This expertise has been linked to 2 coding mechanisms: holistic integration of information across the face and adaptive coding of face identity using norms tuned by experience. Recently, individual differences in face recognition ability have been discovered and linked to differences in holistic coding. Here we show that they are also linked to individual differences in adaptive coding of face identity, measured using face identity aftereffects. Identity aftereffects correlated significantly with several measures of face-selective recognition ability. They also correlated marginally with own-race face recognition ability, suggesting a role for adaptive coding in the well-known other-race effect. More generally, these results highlight the important functional role of adaptive face-coding mechanisms in face expertise, taking us beyond the traditional focus on holistic coding mechanisms.

Abstract = {The current paper examines an "other-accent" effect when recognising voices. English and Scottish listeners were tested with English and Scottish voices using a sequential lineup method. The results suggested greater accuracy for own-accent voices than for other-accent voices under both target-present and target-absent conditions. Moreover, self-rated confidence in response to target-absent lineups suggested greater confidence for own-accent voices than other-accent voices. As predicted, the other-accent effect noted here emerged more strongly for English listeners than for Scottish listeners, and these results are discussed within an expertise framework alongside both other-race effects in face recognition, and other-accent effects in word recognition. Given these results, caution is advised in the treatment of earwitness evidence when recognising a voice of another accent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study re-examines the effect of race of the victim on the probability that an accused murderer is charged with a capital crime and sentenced to death in Kentucky from 1976–1991. It adds over five years of data to our original study. The results show that Blacks accused of killing Whites had a higher than average probability of being charged with a capital crime (by the prosecutor) and sentenced to die (by the jury) than other homicide offenders. This finding remains after taking into account the effects of differences in the heinousness of the murder, prior criminal record, the personal relationship between the victim and the offender, and the probability that the accused will not stand trial for a capital offense. Kentucky's "guided discretion" system of capital sentencing has failed to eliminate race as a factor in this process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Han reviews the neuroimaging evidence for the brain regions involved in empathy for pain. The implicated regions, the anterior cingulate and anterior insula, overlap with those involved in firsthand pain experiences. However, several factors, including sociocultural variables, can influence empathy toward others' pain states. Han discusses the evidence of racial bias in feelings of empathy for pain stales. Han shows that racial bias in empathy of pain can potentially produce real-world effects like differences in medical treatment between racial groups. Several brain regions are implicated including the anterior cingulate, the supplementary motor cortex, the anterior insula, and the medial prefrontal cortex. Han concludes by discussing evidence that intercultural experiences can decrease racial bias of empathy of pain. Living in a country with an other-race majority can decrease the racial bias shown for empathy of pain and alter the neural responses to seeing pictures of pain expressions. Han suggests that future research should investigate how educational opportunities can be offered to eliminate racial bias in empathy toward others in pain.

Abstract = {Purpose: Peers and dates are common targets of adolescent violence. Prevention programs typically address either peer violence (PV) or dating violence (DV) but not both. However, if PV and DV share predictors, prevention strategies could target both behaviors, yielding economic and time efficiencies. Longitudinal data were examined to determine the extent to which physical PV and DV shared predictors. Guided by social learning and social control theories, both risk and protective factors were examined at multiple levels of the social ecology. Methods: Adolescents in the eighth through 10th grades in three North Carolina counties completed self-administered questionnaires in school in the fall 2003 (Wave 1) and again in spring 2004 (Wave 2) (n = 4,227). The sample was 48% male; 55% white, 33% black, and 12% of other race/ethnicity. A generalized estimating equations approach used adjusted standard errors to account for the correlation between the two violence outcomes. Results: For both boys and girls, anger, family conflict, and having models of deviant behavior in the school were shared risk factors, and holding prosocial beliefs was a shared protective factor. For girls, anxiety and having models of deviant behavior in the neighborhood were additional shared risk factors. For boys, heavy alcohol use was an additional shared risk factor and parental monitoring was an additional shared protective factor. Conclusions: Findings can inform the development of comprehensive cross-cutting prevention strategies at multiple levels of the social ecology designed to prevent both types of violence.

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Psychiatric disorders and comorbidity are prevalent among incarcerated juveniles. To date, no large-scale study has examined the comorbidity and continuity of psychiatric disorders after youth leave detention. OBJECTIVE: To determine the comorbidity and continuity of psychiatric disorders among youth 5 years after detention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective longitudinal study of a stratified random sample of 1829 youth (1172 male and 657 female; 1005 African American, 296 non-Hispanic white, 524 Hispanic, and 4 other race/ethnicity) recruited from the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, Chicago, Illinois, between November 20, 1995, and June 14, 1998, and who received their time 2 follow-up interview between May 22, 2000, and April 3, 2004. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: At baseline, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version 2.3. At follow-ups, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (child and young adult versions) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version IV (substance use disorders and antisocial personality disorder). RESULTS: Five years after detention, when participants were 14 to 24 years old, almost 27%of males and 14%of females had comorbid psychiatric disorders. Although females had significantly higher rates of comorbidity when in detention (odds ratio, 1.3; 95%CI, 1.0-1.7), males had significantly higher rates than females at follow-up (odds ratio, 2.3; 95%CI, 1.6-3.3). Substance use plus behavioral disorders was the most common comorbid profile among males, affecting 1 in 6. Participants with more disorders at baseline were more likely to have a disorder approximately 5 years after detention, even after adjusting for demographic characteristics.We found substantial continuity of disorder. However, some baseline disorders predicted alcohol and drug use disorders at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although prevalence rates of comorbidity decreased in youth after detention, rates remained substantial and were higher than rates in the most comparable studies of the general population. Youth with multiple disorders at baseline are at highest risk for disorder 5 years later. Because many psychiatric disorders first appear in childhood and adolescence, primary and secondary prevention of psychiatric disorders offers the greatest opportunity to reduce costs to individuals, families, and society. Only a concerted effort to address the many needs of delinquent youth will help them thrive in adulthood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Recent advances in brain imaging techniques have allowed us to explore the neural basis of complex human behaviors with more precision than was previously possible. As we begin to uncover the neural systems of behaviors that are socially and culturally important, we need to be clear about how to integrate this new approach with our psychological understanding of these behaviors. This article reviews findings about the neural systems involved in processing race group information, in particular the recognition of same-race versus other-race faces and the explicit and implicit evaluation of race groups. Combining the psychological and neural approaches can advance our understanding of these complex human behaviors more rapidly and with more clarity than could be achieved with either approach alone. However, it is inappropriate to assume that the results of neuroimaging studies of a given behavior are more informative than the results of psychological studies of that behavior.

Abstract = {Exposure to faces is known to shape and change the face processing system; however, no study has yet documented infants' natural daily first‐hand exposure to faces. One‐ and three‐month‐old infants' visual experience was recorded through head‐mounted cameras. The video recordings were coded for faces to determine: (1) How often are infants exposed to faces? (2) To what type of faces are they exposed? and (3) Do frequently encountered face types reflect infants' typical pattern of perceptual narrowing? As hypothesized, infants spent a large proportion of their time (25%) exposed to faces; these faces were primarily female (70%), own‐race (96%), and adult‐age (81%). Infants were exposed to more individual exemplars of female, own‐race, and adult‐age faces than to male, other‐race, and child‐ or older‐adult‐age faces. Each exposure to own‐race faces was longer than to other‐race faces. There were no differences in exposure duration related to the gender or age of the face. Previous research has found that the face types frequently experienced by our participants are preferred over and more successfully recognized than other face types. The patterns of face exposure revealed in the current study coincide with the known trajectory of perceptual narrowing seen later in infancy.

Abstract = {Objectives: Racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. underutilize mental health service for mood disorders. This study sought to identify depressive subtypes associated with low use of mental health services across racial and ethnic groups based on a large, nationally representative sample of adults in the U.S. Methods: Based on latent class analysis, we identified the latent profile of depressive symptoms among those who endorsed lifetime depressed mood or anhedonia in the 2001–2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Condition (302 Asian Americans; 8602 Whites; 2266 Blacks; 2254 Hispanics). Proportions and types of lifetime mental health service use across depressive symptom subtypes were assessed and compared across the racial and ethnic categories. Results: A four class model of depressive subtypes was examined across race and ethnicity (“mild,” “cognitive,” “psychosomatic,” and “severe”). Asian Americans, blacks, and Hispanics with “severe” subtype of depression had significantly lower odds of mental health service use compared to whites with “severe” subtype of depression. While Asian Americans did not have higher proportion of “psychosomatic” subtype than other race and ethnic groups, Asian Americans with “cognitive” subtype of depression significantly underused mental health services compared to Asian Americans with “psychosomatic” subtype of depression (Odds ratio:0.34, 95% Confidence interval:0.13,0.91). Limitation: We were unable to account for heterogeneity of the subethnic group compositions based on country of origin and other socio-demographic factors. Conclusions: A targeted outreach intervention to raise awareness among Asian Americans, blacks, and Hispanics with “severe” subtype and Asian Americans with “cognitive” subtype of depression may reduce disparity in mental health service utilization across racial and ethnic groups.

Further, some research has indicated that white women suffer more impairment than men and African Americans. The current study sought to expand the existing literature by investigating an extreme subsample of the obese population. It was expected that participants in the current study would report more impaired obesity-related QOL than in previous research conducted with less obese individuals. It was also hypothesized that race and gender groups would differ in obesity-related QOL and that the relationship between degree of overweight and QOL would not be consistent across race and gender groups. Research Methods and Procedures: Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lite Version data were collected from 512 individuals seeking gastric bypass surgery (mean BMI = 53.3) Results: Results confirmed the study hypotheses. In general, white women reported the most QOL impairment, despite having significantly lower BMI than other race/gender groups. Compared with previous studies, the observed relationships between BMI and QOL were somewhat attenuated. Discussion: Various domains of QOL may be differentially affected by degree of obesity; these relationships are not homogeneous throughout the obese population.

In Exp 1, 60 White and 60 Oriental undergraduates in Canada attempted to recognize White and Oriental faces in a standard facial recognition paradigm. Exp 2, with 92 White and 115 Oriental students from Canada and Singapore, provided a cross-cultural replication of the facial recognition and cross-race contact aspects of Exp 1. Contact with Whites and Orientals differed significantly for students in Singapore vs Canada but was not related to facial recognition even though the CRE was replicated. The CRE was strongly supported for Whites and Orientals viewing White and Oriental stimuli both within and across cultures; however, the contact hypothesis was not found to be a viable explanation of the results.

Descriptive and multivariate (logistic) analysis employed. More Blacks were diagnosed with paranoid subtype. Blacks exhibited a more negative PANSS composite score, lower quality of life scores, and higher AIMS scores than non-Blacks. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of outpatient visits or inpatient admissions between Blacks and non-Blacks. Blacks had lower medication adherence and received less second-generation agents and more antiparkinson/anticholinergic agents. Proportion of Black males receiving depot was greater than other race-gender pairings. Regression results indicate Blacks more likely to be prescribed only first-generations after controlling for depot (OR = 1.64; CI = 1.27-2.12; p = 0.0002).

Ss (aged 8–10 yrs) were asked to nominate bullies (B) and victims (V) from their class or any other class in the school and about specific types of B. Race of preferred partners for shared activities and racial stereotypes were assessed. Results show no significant differences in number of A and W Ss nominated as either B or V. Both A and W Ss were significantly more likely to be named as B of other race classmates. In case of boys, there were no significant correlations between general racial preferences/attitudes on the one hand, and the extent to which they were named by classmates as B of other race children on the other hand. More A Ss than W Ss reported that they had been teased about their color or race, and the opposite was the case for the non-racial types of teasing.

Abstract = {Abstract: This study identifies differences in the predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics of racial/ethnic minorities and non-Hispanic white men and women upon nursing home admission. The data come from the 1999 National Nursing Home Survey of Current Residents and contain 3,798 women of color, 3,787 men of color, 18,719 non- Hispanic white men, and 36,900 non-Hispanic white women. We estimated prevalence differences and 95% confidence intervals for the absolute differences in prevalence. Women of color in nursing homes are more likely than non-Hispanic white women in nursing homes to be bedfast and require assistance with dressing and money management. Men of color in nursing homes are more likely than non-Hispanic white men in nursing homes to require assistance with eating, care of possessions, managing money, securing personal items, and using the telephone. The overall finding suggests that people of color in nursing homes have greater impairments than non-Hispanic whites in nursing homes, and that men of color in nursing homes have greater impairment than any other race or gender categories.

Abstract = {Introduction: Physical inactivity is a risk factor for cancer morbidity and mortality, but its influence in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors is understudied. We investigated sociodemographic, physically limiting, and behavioral predictors influencing leisure time physical activity (LTPA) among CRC survivors. Methods: Pooled 1997–2010 National Health Interview Survey data (N = 2378) were used to evaluate LTPA compliance in CRC survivors according to Healthy People 2010 recommendations. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of LTPA compliance among CRC survivors. Independent variables included: age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, body mass index (BMI), ≥2 chronic conditions limiting physical activity, time since cancer diagnosis, and poverty, marital, smoking and alcohol status. Results: Multivariable regression models reveal that Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, those with ≥2 physically limiting chronic conditions, and current smokers were less likely to comply with LTPA recommendations. CRC survivors who were of “other” race, more than one race, those with some college degree or college degree, and current drinkers were more likely to comply. Discussion: Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, those with >2 physically limiting chronic conditions and current smokers warrant additional efforts to encourage physical activity and to determine the impact of regular physical activity on CRC survivorship.

A total of 227 multidisciplinary HCPs completed the 3-item Influence of Patient Race on Provision of Health Care Services Index (IPR-PHCSI; developed for this study) and the Sickle Cell Transfer Questionnaire. Results suggest that African American HCPs were more likely to perceive race as an influence along all scale items, whereas Caucasian and other race HCPs did not. Female HCPs and those who serve adults were more likely than male HCPs and those who serve children to perceive race as having an influence on the quality of health care. Findings suggest a need for the examination of the health care delivery systems in which persons with SCD receive care to determine if race does, in fact, affect the delivery of health care and to explain the discrepancies in the perceptions of the HCPs.

Abstract = {To examine the association between physician race/ ethnicity, workplace discrimination, and physician job turnover. Cross-sectional, national survey conducted in 2006- 2007 of practicing physicians (n = 529) randomly identified via the American Medical Association Masterfile and the National Medical Association membership roster. We assessed the relationships between career racial/ethnic discrimination at work and several career-related dependent variables, including 2 measures of physician turnover, career satisfaction, and contemplation of career change. We used standard frequency analyses, odds ratios and x² statistics, and multivariate logistic regression modeling to evaluate these associations. Physicians who self-identified as non majority were significantly more likely to have left at least 1 job because of workplace discrimination (black, 29%; Asian, 24%; other race, 21%; Hispanic/Latino, 20%; white, 9%). In multivariate models, having experienced racial/ethnic discrimination at work was associated with high job turnover (adjusted odds ratio, 2.7; 95% Cl, 1.4-4.9). Among physicians who experienced workplace discrimination, only 45% of physicians were satisfied with their careers (vs 88% among those who had not experienced workplace discrimination, p value < .01), and 40% were contemplating a career change (vs 10% among those who had not experienced workplace discrimination, p value < .001). Workplace discrimination is associated with physician job turnover, career dissatisfaction, and contemplation of career change. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring for workplace discrimination and responding when opportunities for intervention and retention still exist.

No significant effects on cross-race eyewitness identification were found for either race or either S or target, nor were there any full cross-over interactions. Europeans found transformed faces generally more difficult to identify than Africans. Both races performed well on nontransformed cross-racial faces, but Europeans were significantly poorer on transformed Black faces, indicating an "other-race" effect.

Abstract = {In the United States, race and ethnicity are considered key social determinants of health because of their enduring association with social and economic opportunities and resources. An important policy and research concern is whether the U.S. is making progress toward reducing racial/ethnic inequalities in health. While race/ethnic disparities in infant and adult outcomes are well documented, less is known about patterns and trends by race/ethnicity among children. Our objective was to determine the patterns of and progress toward reducing racial/ethnic disparities in child health. Using nationally representative data from 1998 to 2009, we assessed 17 indicators of child health, including overall health status, disability, measures of specific illnesses, and indicators of the social and economic consequences of illnesses. We examined disparities across five race/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic other). We found important racial/ethnic disparities across nearly all of the indicators of health we examined, adjusting for socioeconomic status, nativity, and access to health care. Importantly, we found little evidence that racial/ethnic disparities in child health have changed over time. In fact, for certain illnesses such as asthma, black—white disparities grew significantly larger over time. In general, black children had the highest reported prevalence across the health indicators and Asian children had the lowest reported prevalence. Hispanic children tended to be more similar to whites compared to the other race/ethnic groups, but there was considerable variability in their relative standing.

Abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that individuation of other-race faces is more crucial for enhancing recognition performance than exposure that involves categorization of these faces to an identity-irrelevant criterion. These findings were primarily based on laboratory training protocols that dissociated exposure and individuation by using categorization tasks. However, the absence of enhanced recognition following categorization may not simulate key aspects of real-life massive exposure without individuation to other-race faces. Real-life exposure spans years of seeing a multitude of faces, under variant conditions, including expression, view, lighting and gaze, albeit with no subcategory individuation. However, in most real-life settings, massive exposure operates in concert with individuation. An exception to that are neonatology nurses, a unique population that is exposed to—but do not individuate—massive numbers of newborn faces. Our findings show that recognition of newborn faces by nurses does not differ from adults who are rarely exposed to newborn faces. A control study showed that the absence of enhanced recognition cannot be attributed to the relatively short exposure to each newborn face in the neonatology unit or to newborns' apparent homogeneous appearance. It is therefore the quality—not the quantity—of exposure that determines recognition abilities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The authors studied the relationship between the perceptions of racial discrimination of 100 Black British employees (blue- and white-collar workers) and traditional organizational attitudes such as job satisfaction, as mediated by having a same- vs other-race supervisor. Overall, findings indicate that Black Britons who worked for Black supervisors in all or predominantly Black work groups, had a more positive experience than those with White supervisors. The race of the S's supervisor did not affect his or her job satisfaction, but it did influence perceptions of job opportunity and discrimination. Results also suggested that having White supervisors was especially problematic for Blacks in all-Black work groups. Job satisfaction was dependent on the racial composition of the S's immediate work group; those in mostly Black work groups were less satisfied than those in all-Black work groups. Implications of these findings for the developmental relationships of Black Britons are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

By observing this own-race bias in two countries with different demographics, using methods similar to those used in some criminal investigations of eyewitness memory, the authors demonstrated the robust nature of the own-race bias.

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine time-varying associations between predictors of recent multiple sexual partners from middle adolescence through young adulthood. Methods: We examined whether the odds of multiple partners in the past year were differentially predicted by substance use and depression over time, using data from a nationally representative longitudinal study (N = 11,963, 52.2% female, 18.3% African-American, 11.9% Hispanic, 3.5% Asian, 2.6% other race, M age at Wave I = 16.1 years, SD = 1.8). Data were analyzed using the time-varying effect model, which estimates associations between predictors and an outcome as a function of near-continuous time. Results: The proportion of participants having multiple partners increased over time, leveling off at around 30% after age 20. Significant positive associations between substance use and multiple partners were strongest early in adolescence and decreased sharply by around age 18. The significant positive association between depression and sexual behavior weakened with age, remaining significant in young adulthood for women but not men. Conclusions: These findings suggest that factors associated with having multiple recent sexual partners change from middle adolescence through young adulthood. The time-varying effect model can be used to identify risk factors that are especially salient at different ages, thus identifying which age periods may hold the greatest promise for intervention.

Abstract = {Parents’ decisions about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for sons may be influenced by potentially protecting sons’ future female partners from HPV. We sought to identify characteristics of parents likely to consider future partner protection in vaccine decisions, and to determine if parents likely to consider future partners in vaccine decisions had greater intention to vaccinate. We performed a cross-sectional survey of parents with sons in a pediatric clinic in 2010. We used Fisher’s exact tests to identify demographics associated with consideration of future female partners in vaccine decisions. We used adjusted logistic regression to determine if parents likely to consider future partner protection in vaccine decisions had greater intention to vaccinate sons. Most parents (76 %, 187/246) reported vaccine decisions for sons were likely to be influenced by preventing HPV transmission from sons to their female partners. Parents 40 years and older, White and Black parents (vs other race), non-Hispanic, and college-educated parents were significantly more likely to indicate female partner protection may influence vaccine decisions (p < 0.05). Parents likely to be influenced by female partner protection in vaccine decisions had greater intention to vaccinate sons than their counterparts (adjusted odds ratio 2.54, 95 % CI 1.22, 5.28). Overall, many parents were likely to consider sons' female partners in vaccine decisions. Because parents likely to consider female partners had increased intention to vaccinate sons, future efforts to improve vaccine uptake in boys should explore the benefits of highlighting potential female partner protection, as this concept may resonate with many parents.

Adolescents who were socioeconomically marginalized at school [i.e., having <15 % same-socioeconomic status (SES) peers] had lower cumulative grade point averages across high school and lower educational attainment. A similar disadvantage was observed among students who were both socioeconomically and racially/ethnically marginalized at school (i.e., having <15 % same-SES peers and <15 % same-racial/ethnic peers). Indirect effects were also observed, such that demographic marginalization was linked to poorer school attachment, and poorer school attachment, in turn, was related to poorer academic performance. These results highlight the educational barriers associated with demographic marginalization and suggest potential targets for future intervention efforts.

Abstract = {The influence of language familiarity upon speaker identification is well established, to such an extent that it has been argued that “Human voice recognition depends on language ability” [Perrachione TK, Del Tufo SN, Gabrieli JDE (2011) Science 333(6042):595]. However, 7-mo-old infants discriminate speakers of their mother tongue better than they do foreign speakers [Johnson EK, Westrek E, Nazzi T, Cutler A (2011) Dev Sci 14(5):1002–1011] despite their limited speech comprehension abilities, suggesting that speaker discrimination may rely on familiarity with the sound structure of one’s native language rather than the ability to comprehend speech. To test this hypothesis, we asked Chinese and English adult participants to rate speaker dissimilarity in pairs of sentences in English or Mandarin that were first time-reversed to render them unintelligible. Even in these conditions a language-familiarity effect was observed: Both Chinese and English listeners rated pairs of native-language speakers as more dissimilar than foreign-language speakers, despite their inability to understand the material. Our data indicate that the language familiarity effect is not based on comprehension but rather on familiarity with the phonology of one’s native language. This effect may stem from a mechanism analogous to the “other-race” effect in face recognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This study investigates the inter- and intraracial dating preferences of heterosexual Asian males and females as well as gay Asian males. Using data collected from 1270 Internet dating profiles, logistic regression is employed to examine the odds of one’s willingness to date someone who is Asian, White, Black, Hispanic, and some other race. The findings suggest that heterosexual females and gay males prefer to date Whites over nonwhites. Moreover, respondents from both sexual orientations were less likely to express a preference to date another Asian compared to their heterosexual male counterparts. Our results also reveal that educational attainment influences the willingness among Asians to date a fellow Asian. Finally, the analyses indicate significant differences in dating preferences based on the region of residence and age. The current results are discussed in relation to both the historical and present sociocultural racial climate, focusing on how media depictions and identity formation may play a part in shaping racial dating preferences for Asians.

Abstract = {Background: In the U.S., almost 4,000 persons die from drowning annually. Among those 0–29 years, drowning is in the top three causes of unintentional injury death. Methods: To describe racial/ethnic differences in drowning rates by age of decedent and drowning setting, CDC analyzed 12 years of mortality data from 1999 through 2010 for those ≤29 years. Results: Compared to whites, American Indians/Alaska Natives were twice, and blacks were 1.4 times, as likely to drown. Disparities were greatest in swimming pool settings, with drowning rates among blacks aged 5–19 years 5.5 times higher than those among whites. Conclusions: Drowning rates for black children and teens are higher than those of other race/ethnicities, especially in swimming pools. Practical application: The practicality and effectiveness of current drowning prevention strategies varies by setting; however, basic swimming skills can be beneficial across all settings and may help reduce racial disparities.

Abstract = {People have better memory for faces from their own racial group than for faces from other races. It has been suggested that this own-race recognition advantage depends on an initial categorisation of faces into own and other race based on racial markers, resulting in poorer encoding of individual variations in other-race faces. Here, we used a study—test recognition task with stimuli in which the skin colour of African and Caucasian faces was manipulated to produce four categories representing the cross-section between skin colour and facial features. We show that, despite the notion that skin colour plays a major role in categorising faces into own and other-race faces, its effect on face recognition is minor relative to differences across races in facial features.

Abstract = {Little is known about the relationship between health literacy and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in low-income racially diverse patients. The authors conducted a secondary analysis of baseline data from 581 participants enrolled in the Re-Engineered Discharge clinical trial. The authors assessed sociodemographic characteristics, CAM use, and health literacy. They used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to test the association of health literacy with four patterns of CAM use. Of the 581 participants, 50% reported using any CAM, 28% used provider-delivered CAM therapies, 27% used relaxation techniques, and 21% used herbal medicine. Of those with higher health literacy, 55% used CAM. Although there was no association between health literacy and CAM use for non-Hispanic Black participants, non- Hispanic White (OR = 3.68, 95% CI [1.27, 9.99]) and Hispanic/other race (OR = 3.40, 95% CI [1.46, 7.91]) participants were significantly more likely to use CAM if they had higher health literacy. For each racial/ethnic group, there were higher odds of using relaxation techniques among those with higher health literacy. Underserved hospitalized patients use CAM. Regardless of race, patients with high health literacy make greater use of relaxation techniques. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: To document the prevalence of harassment on the basis of weight, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, as well as sexual harassment, among a diverse population of adolescents. Specifically, this study examined rates of each type of harassment reported across groups within the corresponding sociodemographic category (e.g., racial/ethnic category differences in prevalence of racial harassment), and also explored patterns of “cross-harassment” (i.e., differences in prevalence of each harassment type across all other sociodemographic characteristics). Methods: We used data from Project Eating and Activity in Teens 2010 for the study. The sample was composed of 2,793 adolescents (53% female; 81% nonwhite). We conducted regression analyses to yield prevalence estimates of each type of harassment in each demographic and body mass index category. Results: Weight- and race-based harassment (35.3% and 35.2%, respectively) was most prevalent, followed by sexual harassment (25.0%) and socioeconomic status−based harassment (16.1%). Overweight and obese adolescents reported disproportionately higher rates of all forms of harassment than did normal-weight and under weight adolescents. In addition, Asian and mixed-/other race adolescents were more vulnerable to harassment overall compared with those from other racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions: Harassment experiences are prevalent among adolescent boys and girls. Differential rates of each type of harassment are reported across groups within the corresponding sociodemographic category, but a pattern of cross-harassment also is evident, such that differences in prevalence of each type of harassment emerge across a variety of sociodemographic characteristics. Adolescents from various intersecting sociodemographic and weight-status groups are particularly vulnerable to certain types of harassment.

Abstract = {Background: Racial and ethnic differences in patient health care experiences have not been well examined in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. Objectives: To examine racial/ethnic differences in outpatient health care experiences within and between VA medical facilities. Research Design: We assessed within-facility and between-facility racial/ethnic differences in responses to the 2010 VA Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients using mixed-effects multinomial regression. Subjects: A total of 211,459 respondents (53.2%) to a random survey of outpatients from 910 VA medical facilities (71.9% non-Hispanic white, 15.1% non-Hispanic black, 6.4% Hispanic, and 6.7% Other race/ethnicity). Measures: Negative and positive patient-reported experiences in 8 domains of health care. Results: Between-facility effects for black race were higher for 7 domains of negative experiences [risk differences (RDs): 0.37% to 1.64%] and lower for 6 domains of positive experiences (RDs: −0.69% to −2.54%). Between-facility effects for Hispanic ethnicity were higher for 5 domains of negative experiences (RDs: 0.60%–1.34%) and lower for 5 domains of positive experiences (RDs: −1.00% to −1.88%). Hispanic ethnicity was also associated with higher within-facility rates of positive experiences for 5 domains of care (RDs: 2.97%–4.08%). Other race/ethnicity was associated with significantly higher within-facility rates of negative experiences (RDs: 2.04%–3.95%) and lower rates of positive experiences for all 8 domains (RDs: −2.05% to −4.70%). Conclusions: In a national random sample of Veterans managed in the VA Healthcare System, we demonstrated significant within-facility and between-facility racial and ethnic differences in outpatient health care experiences, with differing patterns for each minority group.

We examined HIV testing behaviors along key demographics and in relation to substance use in a diverse sample of 18- to 29-year-old YMSM using cross-sectional survey data. The majority of YMSM had tested for HIV in their lifetime and had undertaken their most recent HIV tests as part of a scheduled health checkup or test, or a desire to know their status. In bivariate analyses, a greater proportion of Black men, Latino men, and YMSM of multiracial or other race/ethnicity had ever tested and were more likely to report a recent HIV test than White or Asian/Pacific Islander (API) men, while those living with their parents and those using stimulants were less likely to have tested. Taken together, multivariate analyses indicated that younger men, API men, and those using stimulants were less likely to have tested for HIV. Findings suggest that testing may be facilitated by reducing barriers to testing or embedding testing within routine health programs, and further, that services must be tailored to developmental and cultural nuances in order to reach all YMSM.

Abstract = {Background: Bipolar disorder is associated with substance use and misuse. However, to date few studies have examined the relationship between hypomania and substance misuse and dependence in the general population. Methods: Data come from the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES), a set of multi-stage area probability samples of US adults (N=10,404). Multivariable linear and logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between DSM-IV hypomania and nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, and prescription drug use. Models were adjusted for age, gender, education, and marital status. Stratified analyses and interaction terms were used to determine whether the relationship between hypomania and substance misuse varied by race/ethnicity. Results: The 12-month prevalence of hypomania was 0.5%. Hypomania was more common among African Americans (0.9%) relative to non-Hispanic Whites (0.5%) or other race/ethnicities (0.7%). Individuals with hypomania were 3.6 (95% CI: 1.5, 8.5) and 2.9 (95% CI: 1.3, 6.8) times more likely to also meet criteria for alcohol abuse/dependence and drug abuse/dependence relative to individuals without. The relationship between hypomania and substance use outcomes did not vary by race/ethnicity. Limitations: The primary limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design, which precludes any inference about the causal nature of comorbid hypomania-substance use. Conclusions: Hypomania is associated with increased likelihood of substance use and dependence/abuse across a broad range of substances. These associations were consistent across racial/ethnic groups. Findings indicate that even sub-syndromal conditions, such as hypomania, are significantly related to substance use and misuse in the community.

Abstract = {Purpose: Differences in health status and behavioral risk factors may explain racial/ethnic breast cancer disparities. We examined racial/ethnic differences in health status and behaviors among female breast cancer survivors compared to females without breast cancer. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a national state-based, random sample telephone survey, we explored differences in self-rated health, obesity and selected behaviors (physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, fruit, and vegetable consumption) among females aged 18 years and older, who reported a previous breast cancer diagnosis (survivors, n = 10,035) and those who reported no breast cancer history (n = 234,375) by race/ethnicity. Adjusted prevalences of health status and behaviors, accounting for sociodemographics, comorbidities and health care access, were estimated by race/ethnicity. Results: Compared to all other racial/ethnic groups, more white females reported heavy alcohol consumption and more black females reported obesity regardless of their breast cancer status. Among breast cancer survivors, more whites (33.7 %) were former smokers compared to blacks (24.5 %), “others” (20.5 %), and Hispanics (16.2 %) (p = 0.001). Racial/ethnic differences in obesity also varied by reported time since diagnosis (p value = 0.018). Among long-term survivors (diagnosed ≥5 years before interview), more black survivors (34.8 %) reported obesity compared to white survivors (23.0 %). Also, among “other” race survivors, long-term survivors (22.0 %) reported more obesity than survivors diagnosed less than 5 years before interview (7.8 %). Conclusions: These findings suggest opportunities to increase health behaviors and reduce racial disparities among breast cancer survivors. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Engaging in healthy behaviors can play a significant role in enhancing health outcomes and quality of life of breast cancer survivors. More research is needed to better understand racial differences in obesity, smoking and alcohol consumption in order to develop effective, culturally appropriate interventions to promote a healthy lifestyle after a breast cancer diagnosis.

The ratio of women's to men's housework hours is greatest for Hispanics and Asians and smallest for Whites and Blacks. White and Hispanic women's housework hours are associated with household composition and employment suggesting that the time availability perspective is a good predictor for these women, but may have less explanatory power for other race/ethnic groups of women. Relative resources also have explanatory power for White women's housework time but are weak predictors for women of Other race/ethnicities. Time availability and relative resource measures show some association with White men's housework time but are generally poor predictors among other race/ethnic groups of men, suggesting that traditional models of housework allocation do not "fit" all groups equally.

Abstract = {The current study aims to evaluate individual, relational, and community-level risk and promotive factors for transactional sex involvement among substance-using youth. Method: Youth (ages 14–24 years) presenting for care in an urban emergency department, who reported drug use within the past 6 months, were surveyed as part of a larger study assessing violence. Of the 600 youth enrolled in this study, 350 presented to the emergency department with violent injury. Based on youth presenting with violent injury, a proportionally selected (age and gender) comparison group of youth (n = 250) presenting without violent injury were enrolled. Participants were queried about both risk and promotive factors at the individual, relational, and community levels. Results: Of the sample, 7.3% reported involvement in transactional sex within the past month. Regression analyses indicated that being African American or other race (as compared with White), having more than one sexual partner, depressive symptoms, negative peer influence, and substance use treatment utilization were positively associated with transactional sex involvement. Increased school involvement was negatively related to involvement in transactional sex. Conclusions: Drug-using youth who reported recent transactional sex involvement are more likely to experience increased HIV risk, depressive symptoms, and negative peer influence and are less likely to experience the promotive factors of school involvement. Future research is needed to better understand the bidirectional relationship between transactional sex involvement and both risk and promotive factors at multiple ecological levels.

Abstract = {Patients often fail to attend appointments in chronic pain clinics for unknown reasons. We hypothesized that certain patient characteristics predict failure to attend scheduled appointments, pointing to systematic barriers to accessing chronic pain services for certain underserved populations. We collected retrospective data from a longitudinal observational cohort of patients at an academic pain clinic in Newark, New Jersey. To examine the effect of demographic factors on appointment status, we fit a marginal logistic regression using generalized estimating equations with exchangeable correlation. A total of 1,394 patients with 3,488 total encounters between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2009, were included. Spanish spoken as a primary language (alternatively Hispanic or other race) and living between 5 and 10 miles from the clinic were associated with reduced odds of arriving for an appointment; making an appointment for a particular complaint such as cancer pain or back pain, an interventional pain procedure scheduled in connection with the appointment, unemployed status, and continuity of care (as measured by office visit number) were associated with increased odds of arriving. Spanish spoken as a primary language and distance to the pain clinic predicted failure to attend a scheduled appointment in our cohort. If these constitute systematic barriers to access, they may be amenable to targeted interventions. Perspective: We identified certain patient characteristics, specifically Spanish spoken as a primary language and geographic distance from the clinic, that predict failure to attend an inner-city chronic pain clinic. These identified barriers to accessing chronic pain services may be modifiable by simple cost-effective interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: To assess racial/ethnic disparities in preventive care practices among U.S. nursing home residents. Method: To implement the Institute of Medicine definition of health care disparity, we used the rank-and-replace adjustment method to assess the disparity in receipt of eight preventive care services among residents and evaluate trends in disparities. The sampling design (stratification and clustering) was accounted for using Stata 11. Results: The 2004 National Nursing Home Surveys data show White residents were more likely to have pain management, scheduled toilet plan/bladder retraining, influenza vaccination, and pneumococcal vaccination than Black residents. White residents were also more likely to have scheduled toilet plan/bladder retraining than residents of Other race/ethnicity. Significant Black–White disparities in receipt of influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination were found. Time trend analysis showed that disparities were neither exacerbated nor reduced. Conclusion: Persistent racial/ethnic disparities in preventive care among nursing home residents exist. We urge the development and implementation of targeted interventions to improve the quality of preventive care in nursing homes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Introduction: Under its authority to regulate tobacco products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibited certain characterizing flavors in cigarettes in September 2009; however, flavored cigars are still permitted to be manufactured, distributed, and sold. This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of flavored cigar smoking among U.S. adults. Methods: Data were obtained from the 2009–2010 National Adult Tobacco Survey, a national landline and cell phone survey of adults aged ≥18 years old residing in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. National and state estimates of flavored cigar use were calculated overall and among current cigar smokers; national estimates were calculated by sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, annual household income, U.S. Census Region, and sexual orientation. Results: The national prevalence of flavored cigar smoking was 2.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6%–3.1%; state range: 0.6%–5.7%) and was greater among those who were male, younger in age, non-Hispanic Other race, less educated, less wealthy, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered (LGBT). Nationally, the prevalence of flavored cigar use among cigar smokers was 42.9% (95% CI = 40.1%–45.7%; state range: 11.1%–71.6%) and was greater among those who were female, younger in age, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Other race, less educated, less wealthy, and LGBT. Conclusions: More than two fifths of current cigar smokers report using flavored cigars. Disparities in flavored cigar use also exist across states and subpopulations. Efforts to curb flavored cigar smoking have the potential to reduce the prevalence of overall cigar smoking among U.S. adults, particularly among subpopulations with the greatest burden.

Abstract = {The year 2000 brought with it many advances and a renewed hope for the future. With this new decade came the first time that those with multiracial and multiethnic backgrounds could identify the full range of their racial and ethnic backgrounds.The creation of this new category is a departure from the 2000 census and a further recognition of this growing population. The change in the U.S. population is due in part to the growth in the some other race group. The two or more race group grew from 6,826,228 in 2000 to 9,009,073. This is a growth rate of 32% and suggests that counselors need to be prepared to work with the members of this growing population and be able to meet their unique cultural needs. Focusing on only meeting the cultural needs of the dominant racial and ethnic groups has left this group to largely fend for themselves resulting in an exacerbation of their struggles. The challenges of constructing a comprehensive developmental theory that could help counselors and other helping professionals provide effective services to this population has been challenging and has undergone many changes over the decades. This chapter focuses on an identity development theory that can help counselors who work with multiple heritage individuals and their families and couples and their families. The multiple heritage identity development model (MHID) provides a framework for understanding the complexity of the identity development process and a means for identifying and developing ways to help multiple heritage individuals with the identity development process.

Abstract = {People have an impressive ability to discriminate and recognize thousands of faces despite their similarity as visual patterns. In this chapter I ask how this is possible, focusing on how faces are mentally represented and whether specialized mechanisms contribute. I consider why unfamiliar faces can be surprisingly difficult to recognize, and why unfamiliar other-race faces can be even more difficult to recognize. I examine the mounting evidence for individual differences in face recognition ability and how these might help us understand face expertise. I ask why newborns have a visual bias for faces, how this bias interacts with early experience, whether there are sensitive periods for acquiring face expertise, and why face recognition performance does not reach adult levels until adolescence. I briefly consider the neural basis of face recognition, although readers are directed elsewhere for a comprehensive treatment of neural mechanisms. Finally, I offer some suggestions for future research directions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Presented photographs of white and black males to 4 groups of undergraduates: 14 black and 14 white Ss enrolled in a black studies course, and 16 black and 14 white Ss in a psychology course. When recall of the photographs was tested 3 days later, white Ss in the black studies course displayed better recognition accuracy for black faces than for white faces. All other groups displayed better accuracy for faces of their own respective races than for other-race faces. Results suggest that for some perceptual performances, "objective" race membership may be less important than allegiance and interest. "Functional race membership" is suggested as a descriptive concept. For black and "functionally black" perceivers, differential recognition accuracy as a function of race was minimized when black faces were in the majority. There was weak evidence that the dependence of differential recognition accuracy on proportional representation of the races is enhanced when race membership is salient.

Abstract = {There is substantial empirical evidence suggesting that criminal justice personnel differentially treat Black (or, more generally, persons of other races and members of visible outgroups) and White citizens. This paper presents a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon called the frustration and negative cue model of unfavorable police treatment of "other-race" persons. A key feature of this new perspective is a focus on the nonverbal aspects of the interaction process between the 2 parties, and a focus on the unconscious, automatic, albeit biased, cognitive processes accompanying the interaction. The model posits frustration to be a necessary (though not sufficient) first condition for the emergence of unfriendly police behavior. More specifically, the model suggests that White police officers experience their encounters with Black interaction-partners as an aversive and frustrating event. This frustration is hypothesized to be a direct consequence of "interpersonal distance-disturbances" accompanying cross-cultural interactions. The model is discussed in detail and supported with empirical evidence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Helicobacter pylori seropositivity is a potential risk for poor cognition among US adults. Methods: Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, Phase 1 (1988-1991), were used. Measures included age group-specific neuropsychological test batteries and two measures of H. pylori seropositivity (immunoglobulin G [IgG] and IgG CagA) (20-59 years old: n = 2090-2,248; 60-90 years old: n = 2123-2388). We explored sex- and race-specific associations. Results: Using multiple ordinary least square and zero-inflated Poisson regression models, we detected a poorer performance among those 60-90 years old with H. pylori IgG+ versus IgG− on a verbal memory test (story recall, correct items), overall (β = −0.04 [0.01], p = .010). Non-Hispanic (NH) blacks and women (20-59 years old) performed worse on the serial digits learning total errors (SDL-TE) when H. pylori IgG+ (versus IgG−), another verbal memory test (β = +0.94 [0.40; p = .029] and β = +1.19 [0.44; p = .012], respectively; p < .10 for interaction by sex and race). More trials to completion on this test (SDL-TTC) were also required among H. pylori IgG+ overall (20-59 years old; β = +0.30 [0.13], p = .033). Other race-specific associations without significant interaction by race were detected in the same direction of worse performance with seropositivity in all three major race groups and for both age categories, covering several domains of cognition. Conclusions: H. pylori seropositivity markers were associated with poor cognition among US adults. Longitudinal research is needed to extrapolote those findings to cognitive decline, incident dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

A telephone survey was conducted between 1996–98 with 1,816 Black and White adults (aged 18–65 yrs) who had recently attended 1 of 32 primary care practices associated with a large mixed-model managed care organization in an urban setting. The patients' rated their physicians' PDM style on a 100-point scale. Black patients rated their visits as significantly less participatory than Whites in models adjusting for age, gender, education, marital and health status, and length of patient–physician relationship. Ratings of minority and White physicians did not differ with respect to PDM style. Patients in race-concordant relationships with their physicians rated their visits as significantly more participatory. Patients of female physicians had more participatory visits, but gender concordance between physicians and patients was not significantly related to PDM score. Patient satisfaction was highly associated with PDM score within all race/ethnicity groups. Findings suggest that Black patients rate their visits with physicians as less participatory than Whites.

Abstract = {African American children—more than other race/ethnicities—rely on emergency psychiatric care. One hypothesized cause of this overrepresentation involves heightened sensitivity to economic downturns. We test whether the African American/white difference in psychiatric emergency visits increases in months when the regional economy contracts. We applied time-series methods to California Medicaid claims (1999–2008; N = 7.1 million visits). One month following mass layoffs, African American youths use more emergency mental health services than do non-Hispanic whites. Economic downturns may provoke or uncover mental disorder especially among African American youth who by and large do not participate in the labor force.

Abstract = {Previous research has shown differences in adult physical activity (PA) levels within urban population, in what types of activities they participated, and where they were active. A sample of 514 urban Philadelphia adult residents was surveyed about level and location of PA. A majority (55.6%) of survey participants reported being vigorously or moderately active or walking enough to meet PA guidelines. A significantly higher proportion of men (vs. women), younger (vs. older) adults and people who were employed (vs. unemployed) met the PA guidelines. Most participants (87.5%) reported walking at least once within the previous week, while 79.3% reported engaging in moderate or vigorous activity. Of the participants who reported being moderately or vigorously active, 64.0% were physically active in indoors only, 22.6% were active in outdoors only, and 13.4% were active in both indoors and outdoors. Significantly fewer black women were active outdoors, compared to all other race/sex combinations (odds ratio = 0.43, p-value < 0.01). In this diverse sample of urban residents, outdoor PA was significantly less frequently reported than indoor PA, particularly for Black women. These findings could help inform urban PA interventions.

Abstract = {We investigated the neural processing underlying own-age versus other-age faces among 5-year-old children and adults, as well as the effect of orientation on face processing. Upright and inverted faces of 5-year-old children, adults, and elderly adults (> 75 years of age) were presented to participants while ERPs and eye tracking patterns were recorded concurrently. We found evidence for an own-age bias in children, as well as for predicted delayed latencies and larger amplitudes for inverted faces, which replicates earlier findings. Finally, we extend recent reports about an expert-sensitive component (P2) to other-race faces to account for similar effects in regard to other-age faces. We conclude that differences in neural activity are strongly related to the amount and quality of experience that participants have with faces of various ages. Effects of orientation are discussed in relation to the holistic hypothesis and recent data that compromise this view. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Adults have been shown to perform better when recognizing adult faces in comparison to their performance when recognizing faces of different ages, resulting in an other-age effect (OAE) that resembles the well-known other-race effect (ORE). Both the OAE and ORE have been proposed to be experience dependent. In the current study, we used the composite-face paradigm with adult- and child-face stimuli to test holistic processing abilities of two groups of participants, a group of child novices and a group of preschool teachers. Our results demonstrate that novices do engage in holistic processing with both child and adult faces. However, the data also show that, for child faces, teachers used holistic processing to a greater extent than do novices. Moreover, teachers also engaged in holistic processing to a greater extent with child faces than with adult faces. These data suggest that experience likely plays a critical role in tuning holistic processing strategies towards specific types of faces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: To examine recent national trends in psychotropic use for very young children at US outpatient medical visits. Methods: Data for 2- to 5-year-old children (N = 43 598) from the 1994–2009 National Ambulatory and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys were used to estimate the weighted percentage of visits with psychotropic prescriptions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with psychotropic use. Time effects were examined in 4-year blocks (1994–1997, 1998–2001, 2002–2005, and 2006–2009). Results: Psychotropic prescription rates were 0.98% from 1994–1997, 0.83% from 1998–2001, 1.45% from 2002–2005, and 1.00% from 2006– 2009. The likelihood of preschool psychotropic use was highest in 2002–2005 (1994–1997 adjusted odds ratio [AOR] versus 2002–2005: 0.67; 1998–2001 AOR versus 2002–2005: 0.63; 2006–2009 AOR versus 2002–2005: 0.64), then diminished such that the 2006–2009 probability of use did not differ from 1994–1997 or from 1998–2001. Boys (AOR versus girls: 1.64), white children (AOR versus other race: 1.42), older children (AOR for 4 to 5 vs 2 to 3 year olds: 3.87), and those lacking private insurance (AOR versus privately insured: 2.38) were more likely than children from other groups to receive psychotropic prescriptions. Conclusion: Psychotropic prescription was notable for peak usage in 2002–2005 and sociodemographic disparities in use. Further study is needed to discern why psychotropic use in very young children stabilized in 2006–2009, as well as reasons for increased use in boys, white children, and those lacking private health insurance.

Abstract = {Social relationships affect empathy in humans such that empathic neural responses to perceived pain were stronger to racial in-group members than to racial out-group members. Why does the racial bias in empathy (RBE) occur and how can we reduce it? We hypothesized that perceiving an other-race person as a symbol of a racial group, rather than as an individual, decreases references to his/her personal situation and weakens empathy for that person. This hypothesis predicts that individuating other-race persons by increasing attention to each individual's feelings or enclosing other-race individuals within one's own social group can reduce the RBE by increasing empathic neural responses to other-race individuals. In Experiment 1, we recorded event related brain potentials from Chinese adults as they made race judgments on Asian and Caucasian faces with pain or neutral expressions. We identified the RBE by showing that, relative to neutral expressions, pain expressions increased neural responses at 128–188 ms after stimulus onset over the frontal/central brain regions, and this effect was evident for same-race faces but not for other-race faces. Experiments 2 and 3 found that paying attention to observed individual's feelings of pain and including other-race individuals in one's own team for competitions respectively eliminated the RBE by increasing neural responses to pain expressions in other-race faces. Our results indicate that the RBE is not inevitable and that manipulations of both cognitive strategies and intergroup relationships can decrease RBE-related brain activity.

Abstract = {During the first year of life, infants’ face recognition abilities are subject to ‘perceptual narrowing’, the end result of which is that observers lose the ability to distinguish previously discriminable faces (e.g. other-race faces) from one another. Perceptual narrowing has been reported for faces of different species and different races, in developing humans and primates. Though the phenomenon is highly robust and replicable, there have been few efforts to model the emergence of perceptual narrowing as a function of the accumulation of experience with faces during infancy. The goal of the current study is to examine how perceptual narrowing might manifest as statistical estimation in ‘face-space’, a geometric framework for describing face recognition that has been successfully applied to adult face perception. Here, I use a computer vision algorithm for Bayesian face recognition to study how the acquisition of experience in face-space and the presence of race categories affect performance for own and other-race faces. Perceptual narrowing follows from the establishment of distinct race categories, suggesting that the acquisition of category boundaries for race is a key computational mechanism in developing face expertise.

Abstract = {A key argument of Massey and Denton’s (1993) American Apartheid is that racial residential segregation and non-white group poverty rates combine interactively to produce spatially concentrated poverty. Despite a compelling theoretical rationale, empirical tests of this proposition have been negative or mixed. This article develops a formal decomposition model that expands Massey’s model of how segregation, group poverty rates, and other spatial conditions combine to form concentrated poverty. The revised decomposition model allows for income effects on cross-race neighborhood residence and interactive combinations of multiple spatial conditions in the formation of concentrated poverty. Applying the model to data reveals that racial segregation and income segregation within race contribute importantly to poverty concentration, as Massey argued. Almost equally important for poverty concentration, however, is the disproportionate poverty of blacks’ and Hispanics’ other-race neighbors. It is thus more accurate to describe concentrated poverty in minority communities as resulting from three segregations: racial segregation, poverty-status segregation within race, and segregation from high- and middle-income members of other racial groups. The missing interaction Massey expected in empirical tests can be found with proper accounting for the factors in the expanded model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Associations Between Relationship Status and Day-to-Day Health Behaviors and Weight Among Diverse Young Adults" by Jerica M. Berge, Katherine W. Bauer, Rich MacLehose, Marla E. Eisenberg and Dianne Neumark-Sztainer (Families, Systems, & Health, Advanced Online Publication, Jan 13, 2014, np). In the article, footnote (a) in Table 3 contained inaccurate information regarding the adjustment for regression models. The correct footnote is provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-00783-001[/rid].) Previous research has shown strong positive associations between physical and psychological health outcomes and being in a committed relationship, such as marriage; however, little research has investigated whether being in a committed relationship is protective for day-to-day health behaviors such as dietary patterns and physical activity. This research examined associations between relationship status and day-to-day health behaviors (e.g., dietary intake, physical activity) and weight status among a diverse cohort of young adults. This cross-sectional study used data from Project EAT-III, a 10-year longitudinal population-based study (N = 1,853) of Midwest young adults. Young adult participants had an average age of 25.3 years, and were 45% male and 55% female. Participants were socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse, including 48.4% White, 18.6% African American, 5.9% Hispanic, 19.6% Asian, 3.3% Native American, and 4.2% mixed or other race/ethnicity. Results indicated that married men were more likely to be overweight/obese (body mass index ≥ 25) compared with single/casually dating and committed dating/engaged men. Married women were more likely to eat breakfast ≥5 times per week compared with women in other relationship categories. No differences were observed in other health behaviors by relationship status. There were no significant interactions by race/ethnicity. Relationship status seems largely unrelated to young adults’ participation in physical activity and dietary behaviors. However, findings suggest that being married may be a risk factor for overweight/obesity in young adult men and may be a protective factor for health-related behaviors associated with overweight/obesity such as breakfast intake for young adult women.

Abstract = {Young African-American women are disproportionately affected by human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) sexually transmitted infections (STI), and engage in greater sexual concurrency than other race/ethnicities. It is important to evaluate behaviors and characteristics associated with the risk of sexual concurrency, so that interventions can target factors most likely to affect positive change. An emphasis on correlates of concurrency beyond individual-level factors has been suggested. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to identify individual- and partner-level characteristics associated with sexual concurrency among high-risk, young African-American women. Data were collected from 570 African-American adolescent women (aged 15–21) recruited from a STI clinic, a family planning clinic, and a teen clinic located in Atlanta, GA from March 2002 through August 2004. Logistic regression analysis was conducted in 2012 to evaluate correlates of sexual concurrency. Results show that almost one-quarter of participants reported sexually concurrent partnerships and 28.4% suspected male partner concurrency. Logistic regression results indicated the number of lifetime sexual partners and relationship factors were the primary contributors to engaging in concurrency in this sample. These findings suggest relationship factors may be important contributors to the prevalence of sexual concurrency among young African-American women. Interventions targeted toward sexual health among young African-American women may need to specifically address partner/relationship factors. Through these findings, we hope to better understand sexual risk taking and develop strategies that would overcome barriers to existing interventions aimed at improving the sexual health outcomes of young African-American women.

Abstract = {Adults’ face recognition abilities vary across face types, as evidenced by the other-race and other-species effects. Recent evidence shows that face age is another dimension affecting adults’ performance in face recognition tasks, giving rise to an other-age effect (OAE). By comparing recognition performance for adult and newborn faces in a group of maternity-ward nurses and a control group of novice participants, the current study provides evidence for an experience-based interpretation of the OAE. Novice participants were better at recognizing adult than newborn faces and showed an inversion effect for adult faces. Nurses manifested an inversion cost of equal magnitude for both adult and newborn faces and a smaller OAE in comparison to the novices. The results indicate that experience acquired exclusively in adulthood is capable of modulating the OAE and suggest that the visual processes involved in face recognition are still plastic in adulthood, granted that extensive experience with multiple faces is acquired.

Results: National prevalence of current use was 25.2% for any tobacco; 19.5% for cigarettes; 6.6% for cigars, cigarillos, or small cigars; 3.4% for chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip; 1.5% for water pipes; 1.4% for snus; and 1.1% for pipes. Tobacco use was greatest among respondents who were male, younger, of non-Hispanic “other” race/ethnicity, less educated, less wealthy, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Prevalence ranged from 14.1% (Utah) to 37.4% (Kentucky). Conclusions: Tobacco use varies by geography and sociodemographic factors, but remains prevalent among US adults. Evidence-based prevention strategies are needed to decrease tobacco use and the health and economic burden of tobacco-related diseases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: To determine whether there were racial/ethnic disparities regarding inpatient total charges associated with US inpatient mental health treatment, for discharges aged between 18 and 64, from hospitals in US counties using different measurement approaches. Methods: Descriptive analyses and single-level and three-level regression analyses (discharges within hospitals within counties) using secondary data of 92,027 discharges within 328 hospitals within 228 US counties from the 2003 Nationwide Inpatient Sample and Area Resource File. Results: Descriptive analyses showed minorities generally had higher charges than whites. Both single- and three-level regression analyses revealed that at the discharge-level, Asians/Pacific Islanders had higher charges than whites and Hispanics had lower charges than whites. The single-level model indicated that charges were higher in hospitals with a higher percentage of Hispanic discharges, and were lower in hospitals with a higher percentage of black and Native American discharges. The single-level model indicated that an increase in the number of Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and other race/ethnicity in a US county resulted in increased charges; an increase in the number of Native Americans in a US county resulted in decreased charges. In the three-level regression model, race/ethnicity was not significant at the hospital-level and was only significant for other race/ethnicity with increased charges at the county-level. Conclusion: The single-level regression model findings would suggest allocating financial resources to mitigate physician stereotyping, physician bias, or statistical discrimination; this would not be suggested using the three-level regression model. The single-level regression model findings would suggest increasing each minority’s availability of and access to mental health services; this would not be suggested using the three-level regression model. Although we believe from a statistical perspective that the three-level regression model is the preferred model as it can provide more precise estimates of all regression coefficients, future research is necessary to consider replicating our findings and to mitigate omitted variables bias.

Abstract = {Perceptual mechanisms have been proposed for the categorization of racial faces. Social cognitive mechanisms involved in the categorization of racial faces, however, remain unclear. The present study investigated whether and how attitudes influence racial face categorization by measuring reaction times to judge orientations of own-race or other-race faces. Study 1 showed that, in a task of judging orientations of Caucasian and Asian faces, European Americans responded faster to own-race (Caucasian) faces than to other-race (Asian) faces. Study 2 showed that Han Chinese responded faster to own-race (Han Chinese) faces than to other-race (Uigur Chinese) faces. In addition, we found that, in both experiments, own-race advantage in reaction times was eliminated by inducing negative attitudes toward own-race faces using a negative association priming procedure. Moreover, the mediation analysis in Study 2 showed that the priming effect was mediated by attitude bias toward own-race faces. Our findings provide evidence for categorization of racial faces in a perceptual, race-irrelevant task, which, however, is strongly modulated by attitudes toward target faces.

Abstract = {As I wondered about what might be important for students and young professionals to hear from a "pioneer," I thought it might be worthwhile to note that my life as a child was pretty much like any other little Black kid of that era. And the things that laid the foundation for my life are the things with which I still struggle today. I am constantly finding myself looking for balance yet getting out of balance one way or the other. Race is a big issue in my life and might be until I die. Race is always a double- edged sword whether I am talking about what happens to the psyche as a result of intragroup interactions or whether I am talking about what happens to the psyche in intergroup relationships. African Americans have helped me to feel inferior and powerful, loved and betrayed, nurtured and loved. I have felt many of the same things about Caucasians in the United States, but I don't know that I have ever felt diminished by Black people, and I have with White people. So I have wondered how in the world I gave White people that power, and how do I take it back? Well, I suspect that I had lots of help handing it over, and I get lots of help taking it back. My help comes from family, friends, and faith. If we let friends stand as a moniker for community, then we can begin to look at what I think might be important to consider if one is going to study multicultural psychology.

Abstract = {Objective: Information is limited concerning the role of religious and spiritual advisors in providing help to people with mental illnesses in Singapore. This study examined that role, as well as the satisfaction with and the perceived effectiveness of the services provided, among people with mental health problems. Methods: Data were collected as part of a nationally representative household survey of residents 18 years and older in Singapore. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3.0, was used to diagnose mental illness as well as to collect information about the mental health services respondents had sought. Results: A total of 6,616 respondents completed the survey; in the overall sample, 1.5% reported seeking help from religious or spiritual advisors. This rate increased to 6.6% among those with at least one mental illness, with the prevalence being higher among respondents with lifetime dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, or bipolar disorder. Sociodemographic correlates associated with a lower likelihood of consultation with a religious or spiritual advisor included reporting “other” race-ethnicity as well as faith in Buddhism, Hinduism, or Islam. Most respondents who sought help from a religious or spiritual advisor in the last 12 months were satisfied with the help they received, and about half reported it to be very useful. Conclusions: Religious and spiritual advisors are an important source of help for people with mental illness, and a majority of respondents with a mental illness were satisfied with the support they received from these sources.

Abstract = {Background: The perinatal period provides unique opportunities to identify and intervene with the co-occurrence of perinatal depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), and substance use problems. Psychosocial screening recommended for women seen in maternal child health settings tends to target single rather than multiple risk factors; there is limited research examining the co-occurrence of these issues especially in racially and ethnically diverse women across the perinatal period. These analyses explore the relationships of sociodemographic, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics in a large, diverse sample of women. Method: Women receiving perinatal services at routinely scheduled visits, including the 6-week postpartum visit, were recruited from 10 community obstetric/gynecologic clinics. Data were collected on perinatal depression, IPV, maternal substance use, and sociodemographic characteristics by bilingual, bicultural research assistants. Results: A total of 1868 women were screened, 1526 (82%) Latina, 1099 (58.8%) interviewed in Spanish; 20.4% (n = 382) screened positive for depressive symptoms based on an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of 10 or above, 20.9% reported harmful drinking, 4.3% reported drug use, 23% reported substance use problems, and 3.5% reported current or recent IPV. Women who were Black, Asian, Pacific Islander, or other race/ethnicity had greater odds for depressive symptoms relative to women who were Hispanic or Latino (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81, p = 0.005). Women reporting substance use problems (OR = 2.37, p < 0.0001) and IPV (OR = 3.98, p < 0.0001) had higher odds for depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a predominately Latina sample, 1 in 5 mothers (20.4%) screened positive for depressive symptoms and over one third (36.7%) reported one or more psychosocial issues during the perinatal period. Screening for multiple risk factors rather than just one can help clinicians tailor interventions for the successful management of psychosocial issues.

Abstract = {Epidemiological research has demonstrated that youth are exposed to potentially traumatic events at high rates. Caregivers play an important role in youths’ successful recovery following exposures to potentially traumatic events. However, past research has documented poor caregiver–youth agreement regarding youths’ exposures to potentially traumatic events, indicating a potential lack of support for many youth exposed to such events. This study examined caregiver–youth discrepancies in the reports of youths’ lifetime exposures to potentially traumatic events, and the relationship between these reporting discrepancies and youths’ post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, mood symptoms, and functional impairment following disclosures of sexual abuse. Participants included 114 caregiver–youth dyads participating in a family-based intervention at four Child Advocacy Centers in New York City. Standardized measures of trauma history, youth PTSD symptoms, youth mood symptoms, youth functional impairment, and caregiver PTSD symptoms were given in interview format to caregivers and youth at the time of intake into the intervention. The demographic composition of the youth sample was 86.8 % female, 13.2 % male, 32.5 % African American, 54.4 % Latino/a, 2.6 % Caucasian, 0.9 % Asian American, 8.8 % other race/ethnicity. Youth ranged in age from 7 to 16. Results demonstrated poor agreement between youth and caregivers regarding youths’ exposure to a range of potentially traumatic events and regarding youths’ PTSD symptoms, mood symptoms and functional impairment. Both caregiver–youth discrepancies regarding youths’ histories of exposures to potentially traumatic events and caregiver PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with youths’ self-reported symptoms and functional impairment. Only caregiver PTSD symptoms were related to caregivers’ reports of youths’ symptoms and functional impairment. Findings underscore the importance of family support and communication regarding exposures to potentially traumatic events and the detrimental associations of caregiver–youth disagreement about youths’ exposures to potentially traumatic events. Recommendations are provided for the assessment and treatment of families presenting in the aftermath of traumatic exposures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The study examined the relationship between the number of concurrent child care arrangements and children’s incidence of communicable illnesses throughout the first 4½ years of life, and whether this association is mediated by the total number of children across care settings. Within-child fixed effects regression models were used to relate changes in the numbers of concurrent non-parental arrangements to changes in children’s illnesses using longitudinal data from the NICHD’s Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,265). 52 % of children attended multiple child care arrangements at least once from 3 to 54 months. Increases in the number of arrangements were associated with a 15 % increase in respiratory problems among children 3–54 months of age, and a 25 % increase in otitis media among children 36–54 months. Associations were smaller among African American children compared to European American and other-race children. Findings suggest that the number of peers with which a child comes into contact at child care mediates the association between increases in number of arrangements and increases in reported respiratory problems. Children attending multiple child care arrangements prior to kindergarten entry experience slightly more contemporaneous communicable diseases, relative to attending single nonparental arrangements, through exposure to more peers.

The changing school district policy and its effects are interpreted in terms of previous desegregation theory and research. During the early years of school desegregation, when students were allowed to attend schools of the other race, but before more coercive policies were implemented, White students actually left nonpublic schools to enroll in Lafayette's public schools. White flight from the district's public schools began with more coercive desegregation efforts in the 1970s. Recent coercive court-ordered desegregation appears to have drastically accelerated White flight from the system, which will likely create an even more racially segregated district.

Abstract = {Introduction: Alcohol is the drug of choice for youth in the United States. By 8th grade, more than 40% of youth have used alcohol; by 12th grade, almost 80% have done so (MTF, 2003). And many of these young people begin drinking at relatively early ages. On average, boys start drinking earlier than girls, and whites and Native Americans start drinking earlier than youth of other race/ethnicities. As alcohol consumption is such a high prevalence behavior among young people, it is crucial to understand the initiation of drinking as well as possible, so as to facilitate and inform interventions to delay this behavior. One facet of this involves investigating trends in the initiation of drinking. Methods: Multiple years of data from 3 national surveys, Monitoring the Future (MTF)-1975 to 2003 for 12th graders, 1993 to 2003 for 8th and 10th graders; the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) [now called the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)]-1991 to 1998; and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)-1991 to 2003, were analyzed using joinpoint analysis to further understanding of trends in the initiation of drinking by youth. The present analysis examines whether the age of drinking initiation has changed over time and evaluates trends in the percentages of youth who start drinking by various grades. Results: Simultaneous examination of data from the 3 surveys indicates that 7th and 8th grades (when most youth are 13-14) are peak years for the initiation of drinking. Further, the present analysis shows that although the percentage of youth who start drinking early (before age 13) has declined (YRBSS, MTF), the average age of initiation of drinking for these "very early starters" did not change over the period 1991 to 1998 (NHSDA/NSDUH). At the same time, an upward shift in the "normative" age of initiation has occurred (NHSDA/NSDUH, MTF). Results of analyses by gender and race/ethnicity indicate similar trends over time. Conclusion: A more nuanced understanding of the initiation of drinking can have important implications for prevention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Nationally representative data from the Add Health survey were used. The relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, known risk factors, and physical developmental timing and cognitive developmental style to suicide attempt was assessed. Depression was a risk factor for suicide attempts in both 9th and 11th grade. Other risk factors differed. Use of illegal drugs, homosexual orientation, using public assistance, and physical development were the important risk factors for ninth graders. For 11th graders, sexual abuse, being in counseling, and being of "other" race or ethnicity (mainly Asian or Native American) were risk factors. The cognitive development variable of using a systematic problem-solving method was protective for 11th graders. Recognizing that risk factors for adolescent suicide attempts change over time and with developmental timing of puberty is an important factor for suicide prevention strategies.

We searched MEDLINE,PubMed, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, and PsycINFO for published literature from January 1990 to July 2010. Across 58 studies (4 615 747 participants), Hispanic populations had a 17.5% lower risk of mortality compared with other racial groups (odds ratio = 0.825; P < .001; 95% confidence interval = 0.75, 0.91). The difference in mortality risk was greater among older populations and varied by preexisting health conditions, with effects apparent for initially healthy samples and those with cardiovascular diseases. The results also differed by racial group: Hispanics had lower overall risk of mortality than did non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks, but overall higher risk of mortality than did Asian Americans. These findings provided strong evidence of a Hispanic mortality advantage, with implications for conceptualizing and addressing racial/ethnic health disparities.

Abstract = {Objective Carotid arterial wall thickness, measured as intima-media thickness (IMT), is an early subclinical indicator of cardiovascular disease. Few studies have investigated the association of psychological factors with IMT across multiple ethnic groups and by sex. Methods: We included 6561 men and women (2541 whites, 1790 African Americans, 1436 Hispanics, and 794 Chinese) aged 45 to 84 years who took part in the first examination of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Associations of trait anger, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms with mean values of common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) IMTs were investigated using multivariable regression and logistic models. Results: In age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted analyses, the trait anger score was positively associated with CCA and ICA IMTs (mean differences per 1-standard deviation increment of trait anger score were 0.014 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 0.003–0.025, p = .01] and 0.054 [95% CI = 0.017–0.090, p = .004] for CCA and ICA IMTs, respectively). Anger was also associated with the presence of carotid plaque (age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted odds ratio per 1-standard deviation increase in trait anger = 1.27 [95% CI = 1.06–1.52]). The associations of the anger score with thicker IMT were attenuated after adjustment for covariates but remained statistically significant. Associations were stronger in men than in women and in whites than in other race/ethnic groups, but heterogeneity was only marginally statistically significant by race/ethnicity. There was no association of depressive symptoms or trait anxiety with IMT. Conclusions: Only one of the three measures examined was associated with IMT, and the patterns seemed to be heterogeneous across race/ethnic groups.

Alcohol use behaviors included past month and past two week consumption, as well as heavy drinking and quantity of alcohol consumed. Consumption of energy drinks mixed with alcohol was also measured. Linear and logistic regression analyses between energy drink consumption and alcohol use were run controlling for gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Results: For each one unit increase in past month (i.e., additional day used) energy drink use, the likelihood of past month alcohol use increased by 80%, heavy drinking by 80% and past month energy drinks mixed with alcohol use by 90%. Similar results were found for past week energy drink use. A positive relationship between energy drink use and quantity of alcohol consumed during a single episode of drinking was also found (p < 0.001). Significant gender interactions between energy drink consumption and alcohol use as well as quantity of alcohol consumed were found, with relationships stronger among males than females. There were no significant interactions by race/ethnicity. Conclusions: Energy drinks are readily available to students and pose potential health risks. Students who report greater energy drink consumption also consume more alcohol, are more likely to mix energy drinks and alcohol, and experience heavy episodes of drinking, which is problematic given the potential negative consequences of these drinks.

Abstract = {Administered 100 trials of the Prisoner's Dilemma game to 20 white and 20 black females in dyads where the "other" (a computer) was represented as being of their own race or the other race. Significant differences in competitive behavior were found which are contrary to previous findings; black Ss playing a white other showed more competition than black Ss playing a black other or white Ss playing a white or black other. In addition, black Ss playing a black other competed more than white Ss playing a black other. Findings are interpreted as indicating a new willingness on the part of the black American to compete on an equal footing with his white counterpart.

Abstract = {Examined the way the sex and race of the rater and of the ratee influence performance ratings, the confidence with which such ratings are made, and the correlation between rated and actual performance. 64 undergraduates rated each of 4 combinations of male–female and White–Black job performers. Ratings were made from videotape recordings of student workers shelving books in a university library. Results indicate that Ss rated members of their own group with more confidence than they did members of other race groups; this confidence was reflected in the variance of performance ratings and the degree to which ratings correlated with actual performance. Black Ss rated other Blacks more highly than did Whites, and White females received lower ratings from all groups. Though statistically significant, omega-square values ranged from .02 to .12, and estimates of validity differences that would result from the observed performance variance differences were no greater than .04.

K. Yin (see record [rid]1969-12269-001[/rid]). Exp I explored the possibility that this result is explicable in terms of the familiarity of the recognition tasks rather than a face-specific factor. Ss were shown slides of 32 Black or White faces, with 16 target and 16 distractor items. Results show that a less familiar task (recognizing other race faces) was more disrupted by inversion than recognizing own race faces. In Exp II, Yin's finding was replicated using a different view of items at test. In Exp III, Ss who were encouraged to make personality judgments on initial viewing of the faces were no more impaired by inversion at test than Ss encouraged to name distinctive physical features. Results imply that the disproportionate effect of inversion upon face recognition cannot be explained in terms of the extra familiarity of the task or the use of identical photographs at test.

Abstract = {Investigated the hypothesis that "own-race bias," the tendency of individuals to perceive more similarity in the appearance of other-race members than in their own, may affect lineup development in criminal investigation. 90 Black and 78 White undergraduates were asked to construct lineups using both Black and White "suspects." On 3 of 4 measures, their behavior was similar while making White lineups but different on Black lineups. Relative to their performance on White lineups, White Ss became less selective on Black lineups but Black Ss became even more selective on Black lineups. Both groups displayed own-race bias by being more selective about own-race photos than other-race photos. This lessening of selectivity may make lineups constructed by cross-race lineup constructors less fair than lineups constructed by own-race lineup constructors.

Abstract = {Studies of the recognition of faces of an ethnic group different from one's own reveal a robust recognition deficit for faces of the respective out-group (cross-race effect or own-race bias) and a tendency to respond less cautiously with respect to out-group faces. Cross-national comparisons reveal that the cross-race effect appears to be larger among low-contact groups. Although exemplar-based models postulating a multidimensional face space are currently in vogue, some of the more traditional accounts (e.g., the contact hypothesis) should not be dismissed prematurely. An extended exemplar-based model that relates the out-group recognition deficit to the out-group homogeneity effect in social perception and judgment appears promising. An in-group/out-group model (IOM) of face processing is proposed that includes aspects of previous theories and derives new predictions (e.g., a cross-sex or cross-age effect). The IOM attempts to account for the out-group recognition deficit and the more lax response criterion with respect to out-group faces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Excessive alcohol use remains an important lifestyle-related contributor to morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. It is well documented that drinking patterns differ across racial/ethnic groups, but not how those different consumption patterns would respond to tax changes. Therefore, policy makers are not informed on whether the effects of tax increases on alcohol abuse are shared equally by the whole population, or policies in addition to taxation should be pursued to reach certain sociodemographic groups. Aims of the Study: To estimate differential demand responses to alcohol excise taxes across racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. Methods: Individual data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 1984-2009 waves (N = 3,921,943, 39.3% male; 81.3% White, 7.8% African American, 5.8% Hispanic, 1.9% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.4% Native American, and 1.8% other race/multi-race) are merged with tax data by residential state and interview month. Dependent variables include consumption of any alcohol and number of drinks consumed per month. Demand responses to alcohol taxes are estimated for each race/ethnicity in separate regressions conditional on individual characteristics, state and time fixed effects, and state-specific secular trends. Results: The null hypothesis on the identical tax effects among all races/ethnicities is strongly rejected (P < 0.0001), although pairwise comparisons using t-test are often not statistically significant due to a lack of precision. Our point estimates suggest that the tax effect on any alcohol consumption is largest among White and smallest among Hispanic. Among existing drinkers, Native American and other race/multi-race are most responsive to tax effects while Hispanic least. For all races/ethnicities, the estimated tax effects on consumption are large and significant among light drinkers (1-40 drinks per month), but shrink substantially for moderate (41-99) and heavy drinkers (= 100). Discussion: Extensive research has been conducted on overall demand responses to alcohol excise taxes, but not on heterogeneity across various racial/ethnic groups. Only one similar prior study exists, but used a much smaller dataset. The authors did not identify differential effects. With this much larger dataset, we found some evidence for different responses across races/ethnicities to alcohol taxes, although we lack precision for individual group estimates. Limitations of our study include the absence of intrastate tax variations, no information on what type of alcohol is consumed, lack of controls for subgroup baseline alcohol consumption rates, and measurement error in self-reported alcohol use data. Implications for Health Policies: Tax policies aimed to reduce alcohol-related health and social problems should consider whether they target the most harmful drinking behaviors, affect subgroups in unintended ways, or influence some groups disproportionately. This requires information on heterogeneity across subpopulations. Our results are a first step in this direction and suggest that there exists a differential impact across races/ethnicities, which may further increase health disparities. Tax increases also appear to be less effective among the heaviest consumers who are associated with highest risk. Implications for Further Research: More research, including replications in different settings, is required to obtain better estimates on differential responses to alcohol tax across races/ ethnicities. Population heterogeneity is also more complex than our first cut by race/ethnicity and needs more fine-grained analyses and model structures.

Abstract = {Background: Access to health care is often contingent upon an individual’s ability to travel for services. Certain groups, such as those with physical limitations and rural residents, have more travel barriers than other groups, reducing their access to services. The use of the Internet may be a way for these groups to seek care or information to support their health care needs. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine Internet use among those whose are, for medical reasons, limited in their ability to travel. We also examined disparities in Internet use by race/ethnicity and rural residence, particularly among persons with medical conditions. Methods: We used data from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), a nationally representative sample of US households, to examine Internet use among individuals with medical conditions, rural residents, and minority populations. Internet use was defined as any use within the past 6 months; among users, frequency of use and location of use were explored. Control variables included sociodemographics, family life cycle, employment status, region, and job density in the community. All analyses were weighted to reflect the complex NHTS sampling frame. Results: Individuals with medical conditions were far less likely to report Internet use than those without medical conditions (32.6% vs 70.3%, P < .001). Similarly, rural residents were less likely to report Internet access and use than urban residents (59.7% vs 69.4%, P < .001). Nationally, 72.8% of white respondents, versus 65.7% of persons of “other” race, 51.5% of African Americans, and 38.0% of Hispanics reported accessing the Internet (P < .001). In adjusted analyses, persons with medical conditions and minority populations were less likely to report Internet use. Rural-urban differences were no longer significant with demographic and ecological characteristics held constant. Conclusions: This analysis confirmed previous findings of a digital divide between urban and rural residents. Internet use and frequency was also lower among those reporting a medical condition than among those without a condition. After we controlled for many factors, however, African Americans and Hispanics were still less likely to use the Internet, and to use it less often, than whites. Policy makers should look for ways to improve the access to, and use of, the Internet among these populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {American Indians occupy a singular position in U.S. society, unlike that of any other racial or ethnic minority group, by virtue of having been the first people to occupy the land that is now the United States. Their unique relationship with the federal government has grown out of a long history of conflict and struggle. This unique relationship stems from the fact that in the early history of the United States, American Indians were not considered a part of the nation. From 1790 to 1871, the federal government dealt with American Indians much as it would with foreign nations, using a mixture of diplomacy, treaties, and warfare. By the late nineteenth century, the federal government had successfully overwhelmed American Indians' military resistance and had turned to the task of assimilating them into modern society. The campaign to assimilate American Indians lasted throughout much of the twentieth century. However, the failure of these efforts, combined with increasing American Indian opposition, led the federal government to abandon them in the 1960s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the federal government gradually replaced the old assimilationist policies with new ones that allowed self-determination. Despite their special status, American Indian/Alaska Natives are among the poorest of the poor in the United States. And like other disadvantaged groups in the nation, a disproportionate number of American Indian/Alaska Native children live in homes at the very bottom of this hierarchy. The subject of this essay is twofold. One is to outline the social and economic position of American Indian/Alaska Native children relative to other, better-known groups, namely Whites and African Americans. These two groups represent polarities of privilege in American society, and juxtaposing American Indian/Alaska Native children against them is a means for gauging more clearly their position in American society. However, to fully understand the place of American Indian/Alaska Native children, it is especially important to understand who is being depicted as an American Indian or Alaska Native in statistical data from sources such as the Decennial Census. As the data presented below will show, there are at least two ways that data for American Indians can be presented and, indeed, they depict two rather distinct communities: one is a mixed race, mostly urban, and less disadvantaged group, and the other group is poorer, more rural, and less inclined to identify with any other race than American Indian or Alaska Native. If there is a single lesson that can be taken away from this essay, it is the remarkable diversity that exists within the population of people who represent themselves as American Indian/Alaska Natives. The complexity of the American Indian/Alaska Native population makes broad generalizations difficult. Yet this complexity underscores the vibrancy and diversity of Native communities.

Abstract = {In this issue of the Journal, Pinkham et al. (see record [rid]2008-06006-020[/rid]) report findings on own-race and other-race effects in their research on facial recognition in schizophrenia. The authors found that the capacity to recognize and remember emotions in faces is no different between Caucasians and African Americans, whether they have schizophrenia or not. But memory for the faces and discrimination of emotions in them are higher when the study subject is of the same race as the person expressing the facial emotion. As did the mental health report on culture, race, and ethnicity from former Surgeon General David Satcher, this study underscores the unfortunate reality that "monocultural ethnocentrism" continues to pervade "good science" in psychiatric research. Aside from the important scientific information Pinkham et al. have elicited, for me this study's greatest contribution to the literature is in showing why, despite legitimate reasons for being suspicious of research, African Americans need to volunteer to participate in research studies and why scientists need to diversify the culture, race, and ethnicity of their research subjects. Until researchers learn to correct the problems emphasized in Guthrie's book Even the Rat Was White, our science will be lacking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied the influence of race on the friendship preferences of 11–16 yr old students in a multiracial secondary school using a cross-year group, longitudinal design, and a sociometric roster-and-rating scale. Ss were 398 pupils of English, 250 of West Indian, and 149 of Asian origin. Results indicate that while Ss were most friendly to classmates of their own-race group and sex, they were also more friendly to classmates of the same sex, regardless of race, than to classmates of the same race but other sex. Sex was a more important determining influence on the ratings than race. Results also indicate that the relationship between age and own-race group friendship tendencies may be curvilinear, with the maximum of the curve being reached at about the ages of 13 or 14. With regard to friendship tendencies toward some other-race group, the evidence suggests that there may well be a similar curve with the maximum being reached slightly earlier or later depending on the particular race group and sex.

Abstract = {Our understanding of the mechanisms and neural substrates underlying visual recognition has made considerable progress over the past 30 years. During this period, accumulating evidence has led many scientists to conclude that objects and faces are recognised in fundamentally distinct ways, and in fundamentally distinct cortical areas. In the psychological literature, in particular, this dissociation has led to a palpable disconnect between theories of how we process and represent the two classes of object. This paper follows a trend in part of the recognition literature to try to reconcile what we know about these two forms of recognition by considering the effects of learning. Taking a widely accepted, self-organizing model of object recognition, this paper explains how such a system is affected by repeated exposure to specific stimulus classes. In so doing, it explains how many aspects of recognition generally regarded as unusual to faces (holistic processing, configural processing, sensitivity to inversion, the other-race effect, the prototype effect, etc.) are emergent properties of category-specific learning within such a system. Overall, the paper describes how a single model of recognition learning can and does produce the seemingly very different types of representation associated with faces and objects.

Abstract = {Background: Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery operated devices that deliver nicotine via inhaled vapor. There is considerable controversy about the disease risk and toxicity of e-cigarettes and empirical evidence on short- and long-term health effects is minimal. Limited data on e-cigarette use and correlates exist, and to our knowledge, no prevalence rates among U.S. college students have been reported. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of e-cigarette use and identify correlates of use among a large, multi-institution, random sample of college students. Methods: 4444 students from 8 colleges in North Carolina completed a Web-based survey in fall 2009. Results: Ever use of e-cigarettes was reported by 4.9% of students, with 1.5% reporting past month use. Correlates of ever use included male gender, Hispanic or “Other race” (compared to non-Hispanic Whites), Greek affiliation, conventional cigarette smoking and e-cigarette harm perceptions. Although e-cigarette use was more common among conventional cigarette smokers, 12% of ever e-cigarette users had never smoked a conventional cigarette. Among current cigarette smokers, e-cigarette use was negatively associated with lack of knowledge about e-cigarette harm, but was not associated with intentions to quit. Conclusions: Although e-cigarette use was more common among conventional cigarette smokers, it was not exclusive to them. E-cigarette use was not associated with intentions to quit smoking among a subsample of conventional cigarette smokers. Unlike older, more established cigarette smokers, e-cigarette use by college students does not appear to be motivated by the desire to quit cigarette smoking.

Abstract = {Purpose: To prospectively determine whether individual, family, and community assets help youth to delay initiation of sexual intercourse (ISI); and for youth who do initiate intercourse, to use birth control and avoid pregnancy. The potential influence of neighborhood conditions was also investigated. Methods: The Youth Asset Study was a 4-year longitudinal study involving 1,089 youth (mean age = 14.2 years, standard deviation = 1.6; 53% female; 40% white, 28% Hispanic, 23% African American, 9% other race) and their parents. Participants were living in randomly selected census tracts. We accomplished recruitment via door-to-door canvassing. We interviewed one youth and one parent from each household annually. We assessed 17 youth assets (e.g., responsible choices, family communication) believed to influence behavior at multiple levels via in-person interviews methodology. Trained raters who conducted annual windshield tours assessed neighborhood conditions. Results: Cox proportional hazard or marginal logistic regression modeling indicated that 11 assets (e.g., family communication, school connectedness) were significantly associated with reduced risk for ISI; seven assets (e.g., educational aspirations for the future, responsible choices) were significantly associated with increased use of birth control at last sex; and 10 assets (e.g., family communication, school connectedness) were significantly associated with reduced risk for pregnancy. Total asset score was significantly associated with all three outcomes. Positive neighborhood conditions were significantly associated with increased birth control use, but not with ISI or pregnancy. Conclusions: Programming to strengthen youth assets may be a promising strategy for reducing youth sexual risk behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {A majority of U.S. children attend some type of child care before entering kindergarten. The quality of child care environment and of teacher–child interactions appear to influence children’s development, but little attention has been paid to the influence of childcare peers. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort, the authors identify patterns of peer group racial–ethnic composition in center-based child care. Bivariate statistics show the relationships among child care quality and racial–ethnic peer-group composition, and a series of regression models assesses the unique contribution of peer-group composition to children’s literacy, receptive and expressive language, math skills, and eagerness to learn. The authors find that center-based child care is highly segregated, with children attending care with predominantly same-race–ethnicity peers. This segregation is associated with differences in quality. Hispanic- and white-dominated peer groups have similarly high quality across domains, whereas black-dominated groups have somewhat lower structural quality and caregiver warmth. Other race–ethnicity-dominated groups have the lowest levels of caregiver warmth. Peer segregation is also associated with differences in child development. Children attending Hispanic-dominated care are found to demonstrate significantly worse outcomes on four out of five outcomes. Possible reasons are explored, and implications for social work research, practice, and policy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Research on mental health among victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) has often ignored racial minorities. As the US population has become more racially diverse, the dearth of research on racial minorities’ experience with current mental health systems makes it challenging for service providers and practitioners to serve them adequately. This study hypothesized that satisfaction with mental health services would be different across race in both the general population and among IPV victims. This study used the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys. Logistic regression analyses were conducted. The study results revealed racial differences in satisfaction only in the IPV group. Race had effects on perceived helpfulness among IPV victims. Asian victims of IPV were more likely to perceive mental health services as helpful than any other race groups. Financial security had a positive effect both on subjective satisfaction and perceived helpfulness among IPV victims. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The current study provides evidence for the existence of an other-age effect (OAE), analogous to the well-documented other-race effect. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that adults are better at recognizing adult faces compared with faces of newborns and children. Results from Experiment 3 indicate that the OAE obtained with child faces can be modulated by experience. Moreover, in each of the 3 experiments, differences in the magnitude of the observed face inversion effect for each age class of faces were taken to reflect a difference in the processing strategies used to recognize the faces of each age. Evidence from Experiment 3 indicates that these strategies can be tuned by experience. The data are discussed with reference to an experience-based framework for face recognition.

Abstract = {Objectives: The two-fold purpose of this analysis is first to contrast the maternal risk factors and birth outcomes of American Indians (AIs) with other race/ethnic groups and to compare the maternal risk factors and birth outcomes of AIs by region to assess whether there are geographic variations in the adverse outcomes that might suggest intervention strategies. Study Design: This study used the National Center for Health Statistics live birth infant death cohort files from 1995-2001. Singleton live births to U.S. resident mothers were selected. The analyses were limited to non-Hispanic American Indians, including Aleuts and Eskimos (n = 239,494), Non-Hispanic White (n = 15,488,133), and Hstispanic births (n = 5,284,978). Results: This comparison of birth characteristics and outcomes by ethnic group revealed that AIs have more adverse maternal risk factors (e.g., unmarried and <18 years of age) than Whites and Hispanics. After adjustment for these factors, AIs have higher risks of low birth weight and preterm birth and elevated risks of postneonatal and infant mortality. Their cause-specific rates for perinatal, SIDS, injury and infection are also higher. The regional analysis indicated the South/Northeast have more low birth weight and preterm problems, but the Mid-West has the highest risks of infant mortality among LBW infants gestational age-specific mortality rates, and mortality from SIDS. Conclusions: These data show that AIs are not a homogenous group as evinced by distinct regional differences. SIDS is mainly a problem in the Mid-West, suggesting the involvement of environmental factors in that region. Further investigation is needed to examine the current AI perinatal health concerns.

Abstract = {This article provides a brief preface to special issue on perceptual narrowing. This is a special issue on perceptual narrowing, the phenomenon that infants toward the end of the first year are worse than they were earlier during infancy in discriminating among items from non-native categories (e.g., other-race faces, animal faces, phonemic contrasts not used in the native language, foreign musical rhythms). Over the same time, infants maintain or improve their ability to discriminate items from native categories (e.g., own race upright human faces; phonemic contrasts used in the native language). Around 9-12 months, exposure to individual items from the unfamiliar category is sufficient to reverse the perceptual narrowing. Together, the articles featured in this special issue document the reality of the phenomenon of perceptual narrowing but make clear that the term does not describe a mechanism or the only developmental trajectory.

In multivariate models, parent-family connectedness was protective against violence; school connectedness was marginally protective. Hopefulness was related to lower levels of violence. The relationship between school connectedness and violence was mediated by hopefulness; some evidence for mediation also existed in the family-parent connectedness and violence relationship. Findings warrant continued exploration of hopefulness as an important protective factor against violence involvement, and as a mediator in relationships between social connections and violence involvement.

Abstract = {We investigate the effect of high school racial composition, measured as percent of non-Hispanic white students, on trajectories of depressive symptoms from adolescence to early adulthood. We also explore whether the effect of school racial composition varies by respondent race/ethnicity and whether adult socioeconomic status mediates this relationship. We analyzed four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health using 3-level linear growth models. We restricted our sample to respondents enrolled in grades 9–12 in 1994/5 who were interviewed at a minimum in Waves I and IV. This resulted in 10,350 respondents enrolled in 80 high schools in 1994/5 (5,561 whites, 2,030 blacks, 1,834 Hispanics, 738 Asians, and 187 of other race). As the percentage of white students increased at the high school respondents attended in 1994/5, blacks reported more depressive symptoms. This effect did not vary by age. In comparison, Asian and Hispanic respondents who attended predominantly white high schools had lower levels of depressive symptoms than their counterparts who attended predominantly minority schools, but they also experienced a slower decline in depressive symptoms through early adulthood. Adult SES mediated the relationship between high school racial composition and depressive symptoms for black, but not for Asian or Hispanic respondents. Our results suggest that high school racial composition is associated with trajectories of depressive symptoms through early adulthood, but the effect differs by respondents’ race/ethnicity. Racial/ethnic disparities in depressive symptoms during early adulthood may have their origins in adolescence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

About 60% of those who requested the OAANP service between July and early November, 2008 (n=4,952) were on wait lists. Wait listed people, especially those on the Home-Delivered Meals (HDM) wait list, were more likely to report poorer socio demographic characteristics, poorer self-reported health status, food insecurity, and nutritional risk. Requesting HDM was the foremost significant factor associated with unmet needs. Other race/not disclosing race information and living alone also increased the odds of being on the wait lists. There is a critical unmet need for the OAANP in Georgia, especially among those targeted by the Older Americans Act and requesting HDM.

In the present study, 86 Black and 76 White college students attempted to identify which of a series of facial photos they had seen earlier. As predicted, a strong Race of S by Race of Picture interaction was found; both Black and White Ss were significantly more accurate in identifying pictures of their own race than pictures of the other race. However, contrary to assumptions made by many legal and criminal justice personnel, neither racial attitude nor reported amount of quality of interracial experience were related to ability to recognize pictures.

Abstract = {Exponential increases in multiracial identities, expected over the next century, create a conundrum for perceivers accustomed to classifying people as their own- or other-race. The current research examines how perceivers resolve this dilemma with regard to the own-race bias. The authors hypothesized that perceivers are not motivated to include ambiguous-race individuals in the in-group and therefore have some difficulty remembering these individuals. Both racially ambiguous and other-race faces were misremembered more often than own-race faces (Study 1), though memory for ambiguous faces was improved among perceivers motivated to include biracial individuals in the in-group (Study 2). Racial labels assigned to racially ambiguous faces determined memory for these faces, suggesting that uncertainty provides the motivational context for discounting ambiguous faces in memory (Study 3). Finally, an inclusion motivation fostered cognitive associations between racially ambiguous faces and the in-group. Moreover, the extent to which perceivers associated racially ambiguous faces with the in-group predicted memory for ambiguous faces and accounted for the impact of motivation on memory (Study 4). Thus, memory for biracial individuals seems to involve a flexible person construal process shaped by motivational factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Pain screening may improve the quality of care by identifying patients in need of further assessment and management. Many health care systems use the numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain screening, and record the score in the patients’ electronic medical record (EMR). Objective: Determine the level of agreement between EMR and patient survey NRS, and whether discrepancies vary by demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods: We linked survey data from a sample of veterans receiving care in 8 Veterans Affairs medical facilities, to EMR data including an NRS collected on the day of the survey to compare responses to the NRS question from these 2 sources. We assessed correlation, agreement on clinical cut-points (eg, severe), and, using the survey as the gold standard, whether patient characteristics were associated with a discrepancy on moderate-severe pain. Results: A total of 1643 participants had a survey and EMR NRS score on the same day. The correlation was 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.52–0.59), but the mean EMR score was significantly lower than the survey score (1.72 vs. 2.79; P < 0.0001). Agreement was moderate (κ = 0.35). Characteristics associated with an increased odds of a discrepancy included: diabetes [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.48], posttraumatic stress disorder (AOR = 1.59), major depressive disorder (AOR = 1.81), other race versus white (AOR = 2.29), and facility in which care was received. Conclusions: The underestimation of pain using EMR data, especially clinically actionable levels of pain, has important clinical and research implications.

Abstract = {Aims: To determine the spirituality of parents whose children have life-limiting illnesses and to determine the factors associated with parents’ spirituality. Methods: Telephone survey of 129 parents whose children were enrolled in a pediatric palliative care program in Florida. The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-being (FACIT-Sp) scale was used to measure parents’ spirituality. The Health Utilities Index (HUI) was used to measure health status. Results: Parents’ average score on the FACIT-Sp meaning/peace subscale was 24.1 out of 32, and 12.5 out of 16 for the faith subscale. Parents’ average total FACIT-Sp score was 36.6 of 48. Multivariate analyses show that parental black non-Hispanic race, "other" race, being married, as well as children’s higher vision and hearing health status were associated with higher spirituality, as measured by the total FACIT-Sp. Two parent household and children’s higher speech health status were associated with lower FACIT-Sp scores. Conclusions: Our results suggest that non-white parents have greater faith-based and overall spirituality than white parents.

Abstract = {HIV disproportionately affects blacks more than other groups in New York City (NYC) as well as nationally. Partner Services (PS) are a proven way to interrupt HIV transmission. In NYC, PS outcomes are worse among blacks compared to other race/ethnic groups. We compared PS outcomes by country of birth to identify opportunities for improved PS effectiveness. We assessed number of sex and needle-sharing partners elicited, notified, and HIV tested, as well as number of newly identified HIV cases and number of interviews needed to identify a new HIV case. Between July 2006 and December 2008, 1049 African Americans, 285 Caribbean-born blacks, and 168 African-born blacks were interviewed for HIV Partner Services. African Americans, Caribbean-born blacks, and African-born blacks had average age of 38, 37, and 43 years and 10.0%, 0.4%, and 0.6% reported intravenous drug use, respectively. All groups had a high proportion of cases with an AIDS-defining CD4 count at HIV diagnosis (30.8%, 34.5%, and 47.9% for African Americans, Africans, and Caribbeans, respectively). The number needed to interview to find one newly diagnosed HIV case was high for all groups (66, 57, and 56 among African Americans, Africans, and Caribbeans, respectively), indicating all had similarly low rates of new HIV case identification. NYC blacks and their partners are benefiting from current Partner Services outreach as PS did identify new HIV cases among partners from all 3 groups. However, further work is needed to improve HIV case finding from Partner Services in these groups, and additional measures to promote early diagnosis are needed.

Abstract = {Examined the link between heart disease (HD) worry with self-initiated changes in diet and exercise health protective behaviors (HPBs) among 139 Blacks and 1,028 Whites (aged 18+ yrs). Utilizing the concept "vulnerability," from I. Rosenstock's (1966) Health Belief Model, it is hypothesized that worry about HD will more readily translate into diet and exercise health behaviors for Blacks than for Whites. The data come from a national probability survey of families in the US. Findings indicate substantial support for the hypothesis when both race and socioeconomic status (SES) are considered. Among Whites, HD worry had no effect on HPB. For Blacks, worry about HD had a pronounced effect on HPB but only among lower SES Blacks. A test for interaction indicates that the low-SES Black slope is significantly different than the slopes in the other race–SES categories.

The authors find that the U.S. labor market favors White male immigrants, followed by Black male and White female immigrants, and finally Black women. The authors also find that male immigrants earned more per hour than female immigrants regardless of race. Considering change over time, this study finds that the earnings gap between Black and White male immigrants is growing larger over time, the positive association between foreign work experience and earnings is attenuated over time, and for women, the positive effect of earning a college degree on earnings is growing stronger over time. These findings confirm many of the conclusions reached by other race and gender scholars; however, the authors extend this work by focusing on male and female African immigrants, who are largely under-represented in the literature, and by examining change over time.

Abstract = {This study examined substance abuse treatment utilization across three dimensions of sexual orientation (identity, attraction, and behavior) in a large national sample of adults in the United States. Prevalence estimates were based on data collected from the 2004–2005 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. The sample consisted of 34,653 adults 20 years and older, and represented a population that was 52% women, 71% White, 12% Hispanic, 11% African American, 4% Asian, and 2% other race/ethnicities. An estimated 2% of the target population self-identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual; 4% reported same-sex sexual behavior, and 6% reported same-sex sexual attraction. Sexual minorities, especially women, had a greater likelihood of lifetime substance use disorders and earlier age of drinking onset. The majority of respondents with substance use disorders were untreated and lifetime substance abuse treatment utilization differed based on sexual orientation. Sexual minorities were found to have more extensive family histories of substance abuse problems. The findings indicate the underutilization of substance abuse treatment among all adults, and highlight some important factors to consider when working with sexual minorities.

Abstract = {This chapter discusses the neurobiology of stereotyping and prejudice with advanced research techniques such as neuroimaging. Since the advent of modern social neuroscience research on prejudice and stereotyping nearly two decades ago, considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the neural substrates that seem to be linked to certain processes and brain structures involved in the timecourse of perceiving and later thinking about outgroup members. We know that the perception and categorization of other race faces is a rather automatic process that occurs very early (often within 130 ms), and involves the amygdala. Though initially believed to reflect a fear response to the outgroup face, researchers now think the amygdala response is an indicator of strength of response, and not valence. Another fascinating finding is the reciprocal influence of explicit cognition on the control of both conscious processes designed to not engage in stereotyping and also significantly attenuates amygdala responses early in social perception. While neuroimaging can implicate particular neural structures that appear to be specifically activated while engaging in a particular cognitive activity, it is important to remember that most neuroimaging studies point to multiple structures being involved in social perception, at various points in time, when perceiving outgroups. Moreover, certain structures are not only activated, for example, at the earliest phases of social perception, but often are activated at multiple points in the social perception process, depending on the perceiver, the target, and the perceiver's cognitive goals.

Abstract = {Income assistance programs (e.g., Temporary Assistance to Needy Families; TANF) and child welfare service (CWS) programs have implicit intentions to prepare children for an adulthood that is free from serious criminal activity. This cross-sectional study compares the felonious arrests as adults of youth who were involved with TANF (n = 6,596) with those who were involved with CWS (n = 1316). In the CWS population, we compare youth who emancipated from foster care (n = 841), those who reunified (n =278), and those with other exits (n = 197). Outcomes of interest include the severity of the felony an individual was charged with as an adult as well as the hazard of being arrested after age 16 years. Findings show that as adults, TANF-involved youth are less likely than former foster youth to be charged with a felony; moreover, when former TANF youth are charged with felonies as adults, the felonies are less severe than felony charges incurred by former foster youth. Overall, as young adults, males and African American youth are not only more likely to be charged with felonies than other race youth or females but also are more likely to be charged with felonies of higher severity ratings than other race youth or females. Entering foster care as an adolescent and having multiple placements in care are associated with poorer outcomes in adulthood. However, youth who remain in foster care longer are less likely to be charged with a felony. The study confirms earlier work on adverse criminal justice-related outcomes for former foster youth and clarifies the need for specific interventions to reduce subsequent criminal involvement.

Abstract = {Objective: We examined racial disparities (White, African American, and other race) in health status (self-rated health, lower-body functional limitations, psychological distress, and body mass index [BMI]) and behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity) of long-term cancer survivors (C5 years) when compared to non-cancer controls. Methods: Using 2005–2007 National Health Interview Survey data, we computed adjusted prevalence estimates of health status and behaviors for all six groups, controlling for sociodemographic factors, medical-care access, or presence of other chronic conditions. Results: The sample included 2,762 (3.6%) survivors and 73,059 controls. Adjusted prevalence estimates for each race were higher for long-term survivors than controls in terms of having fair-poor self-rated health, C1 limitation, psychological distress, and higher BMI but were similar between survivors and controls in terms of physical activity, smoking, and alcohol use. Adjusted prevalence estimates for having fair-poor self-rated health were higher for African American survivors than white survivors, lower for psychological distress, physical activity and alcohol use, and similar for smoking and BMI. Conclusion: With the exception of smoking and limitations, racial differences existed among survivors for all health-status and behavioral measures.

Abstract = {Background: In prior studies, the use of standard breast cancer treatments has varied by race, but previous analyses were not nationally representative. Therefore, in a comprehensive, national cohort of Medicare patients, racial disparities in the use of radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for invasive breast cancer were quantified. Methods: A national Medicare database was used to identify all beneficiaries (age >65 years) treated with BCS for incident invasive breast cancer in 2003. Claims codes identified RT use, and Medicare demographic data indicated race. Logistic regression modeled RT use in white, black, and other-race patients, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic covariates. Results: Of 34,080 women, 91% were white, 6% were black, and 3% were another race. The mean age of the patients was 76 ± 7 years. Approximately 74% of whites, 65% of blacks, and 66% of other-race patients received RT (P < .001). After covariate adjustment, whites were found to be significantly more likely to receive RT than blacks (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-1.63 [P < .001]). Disparities between white and black patients varied by geographic region, with blacks in areas of the northeastern and southern United States demonstrating the lowest rates of RT use (57% in these regions). In patients age <70 years, racial disparities persisted. Specifically, 83% of whites, 73% of blacks, and 78% of other races in this younger group received RT (P < .001). Conclusions: In this comprehensive national sample of older breast cancer patients, substantial racial disparities were identified in RT use after BCS across much of the United States. Efforts to improve breast cancer care require overcoming these disparities, which exist on a national scale. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To monitor trends in HIV seroprevalence in the United States, HIV testing was included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted from 1999 to 2006. Methods: From 1999 to 2006, 11,928 participants aged 18-49 years were tested for HIV antibody. Prevalence estimates were weighted to account for oversampling and nonresponse. Results: There were 67 HIV antibody-reactive individuals for a seroprevalence of 0.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.6]. In the only age subgroup directly comparable between surveys (18-39 years), HIV seroprevalence remained constant from NHANES III (1988-1994) to NHANES 1999-2002 and 2003-2006. In NHANES 1999-2006, non-Hispanic blacks had significantly higher HIV seroprevalence (2.0%, 95% CI 1.5-2.7) compared with individuals in all other race/ethnic groups combined. Seroprevalence was also higher in each race/ethnic group among men who have sex with men (9.4% 95% CI 5.0-17.1), among persons who had detectable antibody to herpes simplex type-two (1.9% 95% CI 1.4-2.8), among those who had 50 or more lifetime sex partners (3.4%, 95% CI 1.7-6.7), and among those who never married (0.8%, 95% CI 0.5-1.3). Conclusions: In this household-based population, seroprevalence did not significantly change from NHANES III to NHANES 1999-2006. Non-Hispanic blacks had significantly higher prevalence of infection compared with other race/ethnic groups. Male-to-male sex and the presence of HSV-2 antibody were the strongest predictors of HIV infection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Three experiments examined the cultural relativity of emotion recognition using the visual search task. Caucasian-English and Japanese participants were required to search for an angry or happy discrepant face target against an array of competing distractor faces. Both cultural groups performed the task with displays that consisted of Caucasian and Japanese faces in order to investigate the effects of racial congruence on emotion detection performance. Under high perceptual load conditions, both cultural groups detected the happy face more efficiently than the angry face. When perceptual load was reduced such that target detection could be achieved by feature-matching, the English group continued to show a happiness advantage in search performance that was more strongly pronounced for other race faces. Japanese participants showed search time equivalence for happy and angry targets. Experiment 3 encouraged participants to adopt a perceptual based strategy for target detection by removing the term 'emotion' from the instructions. Whilst this manipulation did not alter the happiness advantage displayed by our English group, it reinstated it for our Japanese group, who showed a detection advantage for happiness only for other race faces. The results demonstrate cultural and linguistic modifiers on the perceptual saliency of the emotional signal and provide new converging evidence from cognitive psychology for the interactionist perspective on emotional expression recognition.

Abstract = {Attention to same-sex marriage has increased in the past decade. This study examines the perceptions of same-sex marriage among social work faculty. Faculty play a critical role in preparing future social workers for competent, ethical practice—including advocacy for social policies inclusive of sexual minorities. The present study investigates endorsement of same-sex marriage among teaching faculty in U.S. and English-speaking Canadian MSW programs. Twelve factors were found to be significant in the bivariate analyses; however, only four retained significance in the multivariate analysis. Specifically, the multivariate analysis found “other race” and religiosity to be negatively associated with support for same-sex marriage, whereas acceptance of same-sex relationships and understanding gender-based oppression as the root cause of domestic and sexual violence were positively associated with same-sex marriage support. The results highlight the importance of social attitudes concerning same-sex relationships and gender-based oppression for endorsement of same-sex marriage. Implications for social work education and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Researchers studying people’s perceptions of variability among members of social groups, or perceived group variability, have tended to focus on the ways in which perceivers’ group affiliations lead to in-group and out-group homogeneity effects, including the other-race effect. However, recent advances have highlighted the role of additional influences. In this review, we consider the influence of (a) the perceiver’s group affiliation, (b) the group’s objective variability, (c) the group’s social position, and (d) the group’s central tendency on trait dimensions. We focus on recent research in these areas that has highlighted the strategic, context-dependent, and symbolic nature of perceived group variability. We conclude that future research needs to adopt a multicausal approach in order to provide a more complete and comprehensive account of perceived group variability.

Abstract = {The culture of lower-class and underclass African Americans is distinctly different from that of the professionals who treat them in analysis, whether they are Black, White, or of some other race. Children are often raised by mothers who are very young, without the involvement of the father, and are often exposed to violence and trauma. Ego development may therefore be poor, leading to depression and intellectual limitations. Therapists must carefully examine their own preconceptions about people from other races and be prepared for racialized transference and countertransference. They must also be sensitive to the possibility that a child may have had important parental figures other than his or her biological mother, and probe for these in composing the patient’s history.

Abstract = {This editorial discusses the some new evidence on multi-modal contributions, scanning, and recognition within the context of face processing. Faces are essential for everyday social interactions and are crucial for recognition of family and friends or judgments of sex, age, and intention of individuals. Over the last two decades, a great deal has been learned about human adults’ ability to process faces and its developmental origin. New technologies such as eye tracking have provided powerful tools to investigate the issue of face processing and recognition. Faces are also multimodal, and studying the face–voice relation is an important step toward understanding the development of social cognition. This special issue of International Journal of Behavioral Development will present the most recent studies in these areas. The first series of papers focused on face voice integration. Additional articles examine visual scanning patterns for other-race and other-species faces, speaking faces, and the role of experience in the development of these behaviors. This special issue illustrates some of the diversity and complexity of research and theorizing into face processing and its development in infancy and early childhood.

Abstract = {Background: Sponsorship of Formula One (F1) motor racing, which has been used as an indirect medium of tobacco advertising for several decades, was prohibited by the 2005 European Union Tobacco Advertising Directive. Most F1 tobacco sponsorship of motor racing in the EU has since ceased, with the exception of the Scuderia Ferrari team, which continues to be funded by Philip Morris. In 2007, the Marlboro logo on Ferrari cars and other race regalia was replaced by an evolving ‘barcode’ design, which Ferrari later claimed was part of the livery of the car, and not a Marlboro advertisement. Objective: To determine whether the ‘barcode’ graphics used by Ferrari represent ‘alibi’ Marlboro advertising. Methods: Academic and grey literature, and online tobacco industry document archives, were searched using terms relevant to tobacco marketing and motorsport. Results: Tobacco sponsorship of F1 motor racing began in 1968, and Philip Morris has sponsored F1 teams since 1972. Phillip Morris first used a ‘barcode’ design, comprising red vertical parallel lines below the word Marlboro on the British Racing Motors F1 car in 1972. Vertical or horizontal ‘barcode’ designs have been used in this way, latterly without the word Marlboro, ever since. The modern ‘barcode’ logos occupied the same position on cars and drivers’ clothing as conventional Marlboro logos in the past. The shared use of red colour by Marlboro and Ferrari is also recognised by Philip Morris as a means of promoting brand association between Marlboro and Ferrari. Conclusion: The Ferrari ‘barcode’ designs are alibi Marlboro logos and hence constitute advertising prohibited by the 2005 EU Tobacco Advertising Directive.

Abstract = {Although fathers are increasingly a focus of attention in research, there is a dearth of research on depressive symptoms among fathers, especially young fathers with toddlers. This study used longitudinal data to examine what risk factors, including the age status of fathers (e.g., late adolescence, emerging adulthood, and adulthood), may be associated with depressive symptoms of fathers when their children were 3 and 5 years of age. A subsample of families for which complete data were available on all variables was used in the analyses (n = 1,403). About 46% of study sample was African American, 27% White, 23% Hispanic, and 4% other race/ethnicity. Paternal depressive symptoms were measured using Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form (CIDI-SF). Late adolescent fatherhood was significantly associated with third-year paternal depressive symptoms but not with fifth-year depressive symptoms. Those who reported low social support were more likely to be depressed at both times. Fathers who did not work for regular pay were more likely to be depressed at the third-year follow-up, but not at the fifth-year follow-up. Parenting stress and being booked/charged with a crime were not associated with third-year paternal depressive symptoms, but were with fifth-year paternal depressive symptoms. This study emphasizes the importance of screening for depressive symptoms of fathers even before the birth of their child and monitoring and treating postpartum depressive symptoms, as first-year depressive symptoms was a significant predictor for third- and fifth-year depressive symptoms. Service providers should focus on the mental health of fathers as well as mothers to promote healthy environments for their children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Purpose: Depressive disorders are a growing public health concern, however, a substantial number of depressed individuals do not receive treatment. This study examined the longitudinal predictors of receiving depression treatment among adults with persistent depressive disorders and no lifetime history of treatment. Methods: The sample included respondents to the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol Related Conditions (NESARC), a large population-based survey, who met criteria for a 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymia (DYS) and had no prior depression treatment. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted examining which socio-demographic and clinical predictors among individuals with depressive disorders and no prior treatment at Wave 1 were associated with receiving depression treatment at Wave 2 (N = 337). Results: Only 47.2% of those with MDD or DYS and no prior treatment at Wave 1 had received depression treatment at Wave 2. Females were more likely to have received treatment at Wave 2: those of Hispanic ethnicity, other race, unmarried, 12 years of education, self-rated health of good/very good/excellent and anxiety disorders were less likely to have received treatment at Wave 2. Those with substance use disorders were more likely to have received treatment at Wave 2. Conclusions: This study highlights individuals who would likely benefit from increased efforts to enhance depression treatment utilization.

Abstract = {Purpose: Our goal was to describe the types of physical activities and sedentary pursuits reported by children living in residential children’s homes and make comparisons by age, gender, and race/ethnic groups. Methods: Participants were 263 children (52% male, 40% 11 to 14 years old, 53% White, 23% African American, and 24% other race/ethnic groups) in 23 residential children’s homes in North and South Carolina. The median length of stay in the homes was 6 months. Physical activities and sedentary pursuits were reported over a 3-day period using the 3-Day Physical Activity Recall (3DPAR). Results: Boys reported participating in more basketball (P ≤ .001), football (P ≤ .001), and videogames or surfing the net (P ≤ .001) than did girls. Girls reported more cheerleading, social dance, and homework than did boys (P values ≤ .01). There were few race differences. Fewer older children reported participation in physical education classes, and more reported working part-time than younger children (P values ≤ .001). Conclusions: Children in residential homes appear to participate in activities that are similar to children living with their parents, with boys reporting more team activities and girls reporting more individual activities. However, children in residential children’s homes may participate in some physical activities for shorter periods of time than children living with their parents.

Abstract = {The utility of online methods of data collection has led to the rapid adoption of Internet-based surveys for social sciences research. Given the potential problems of noncoverage and nonresponse when making use of this data collection method, the present study aimed to investigate differences between an online and a paper-based sample drawn from the same population and under the same conditions. The sample was composed of 597 undergraduate and postgraduate students from the University of the Witwatersrand in the 2010 academic year, the majority of whom (75.2%) chose to complete the paper-based version of the questionnaire. Results indicate that Internet access differs for both racial and socioeconomic groups in the sample but that demographic factors continue to affect the choice to complete online even after Internet access has been accounted for. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Black African respondents were less likely to complete online than other race groups while older respondents, those who spend more time online per day, those with higher levels of maternal education, those with lower levels of paternal education as well as female respondents were more likely to make use of the online completion option. Implications and alternatives to online data collection are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Perceptual narrowing in the visual, auditory, and multisensory domains has its developmental origins during infancy. The current study shows that experimentally induced experience can reverse the effects of perceptual narrowing on infants’ visual recognition memory of other-race faces. Caucasian 8- to 10-month-olds who could not discriminate between novel and familiarized Asian faces at the beginning of testing were given brief daily experience with Asian female faces in the experimental condition and Caucasian female faces in the control condition. At the end of 3 weeks, only infants who received daily experience with Asian females showed above-chance recognition of novel Asian female and male faces. Furthermore, infants in the experimental condition showed greater efficiency in learning novel Asian females compared with infants in the control condition. Thus, visual experience with a novel stimulus category can reverse the effects of perceptual narrowing during infancy via improved stimulus recognition and encoding.

Abstract = {Purpose: To describe uncorrected distance visual impairment (VI). Methods: We conducted an analysis of the 3,555 adolescents aged 12 through 21 years who participated in the 2005–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Distance VI was defined as 20/40 or worse in the better-seeing eye. Data were weighted to represent the civilian noninstitutionalized population. Results: Overall, 12.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.7%–14.1%) had distance VI, which was correctable to 20/30 or better in both eyes in 86.1% (95% CI: 83.6%–89.5%). The prevalence was higher among those who reported not having corrective lenses available (44.3%) compared with those who reported that they did not need them (8.5%) or who had them available (5.2%; p < .001). After adjusting for potential confounders, those who were 12 or 13 years of age had 2.27 (95% CI: 1.32–3.90) greater odds of distance VI than older adolescents, and the odds of distance VI were greater among non-Hispanic blacks (1.66 [95% CI: 1.11–2.48]), Hispanics (1.96 [95% CI: 1.35–2.84]), or other race/ethnicities (2.06 [95% CI: 1.19–3.57]) than among non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions: More than 1 in 10 adolescents had uncorrected distance VI. To address this, interventions should address case detection, access to eye care, and adherence with corrective lenses.

Abstract = {Reviews the article, Extreme Binge Drinking Among 12th-Grade Students in the United States by M. E. Patrick, J. E. Schulenberg, and M. E. Martz (2013). The risks associated with alcohol use among youth in the United States has been previously reported. The authors of the current study examined binge drinking and extreme binge drinking among a national sample of US high school seniors between 2005 and 2011. More than 16,000 (52.3% female) students participated. Two thirds of participants were white, 11% black, 13.1% Hispanic, and 11.5% of other race/ethnicity. The authors discuss that while youth binge drinking has decreased since record-high levels in the late 1970s, extreme binge drinking does not seem to be declining. One significant limitation of this study is that students who dropped out of high school before their senior year are not included. Therefore, it is possible that the true frequency of binge and extreme binge drinking among youth of this age group may be even higher than indicated by these results. The data presented in this study could be used in development of prevention and intervention programs aimed at youth in the United States.

Problems of cross-racial identification evidence are not solved by requiring trial judges to tell juries that all cross-racial identifications are suspect, when that is not necessarily the case, nor by enlisting identification experts to testify at trial that, in general, cross-racial witnesses are less credible than others. Jury instructions and expert testimony on cross-racial identification are flawed insofar as they address generalities; neither can tell a jury anything about the particular identification at issue. Problems inherent in cross-racial identifications are instead best addressed by taking measures to prevent mistaken identifications in the first place, such as improving line-up procedures. Unlike special jury instructions or experts, improved line-up procedures could enhance the reliability of the identification itself and consequently the integrity of the verdict in a criminal trial.

Abstract = {Context: Studies increasingly consider the role of pregnancy motivations on contraceptive use. Few studies include measures of men's pregnancy motivations. Methods: We used baseline data (from a couples-intervention study) to examine the contribution of women's and men's pregnancy motivations and participation in decision making to contraceptive use by women in relatively stable relationships who were not trying to get pregnant. In addition to conducting multivariate analyses, we assessed agreement between a woman's perceptions of and her partner's reports of his pregnancy motivations. Results: We observed moderate agreement between men's pregnancy motivations and their partners' perceptions of those motivations. Levels of agreement about participation in decision making were somewhat lower. In bivariate analyses, effective contraceptive use was significantly associated with two measures of pregnancy motivation for men and women. In multivariate analyses, only women not wanting a child in 2 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.73), women's (aOR, 1.80) and men's (aOR, 0.78) participation in decision making, women believing their partners favored contraceptive use (aOR, 2.01), relationships lasting 2 or more years (aOR, 1.98), and ethnicity/race (Latina aOR, 0.27; other race aOR , 0.45) were associated with effective contraceptive use. Conclusion: Providers and those developing interventions must recognize that some women who are “not trying to get pregnant” have weak motivations to avoid pregnancy, and so should help women to clarify their motivations and seek support from their partners for contraceptive use. To understand the role of pregnancy motivations, future research may include both qualitative and longitudinal quantitative studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Socioculturally relevant measures of medical mistrust are needed to better address health disparities, especially among Black men, a group with lower life expectancy and higher death rates compared to other race/gender groups. Objectives: The study aim was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale (GBMMS) in a Black male sample. Design: Data were collected as part of a randomized controlled trial testing educational strategies to support Black men’s decisions about prostate cancer screening. Participants: Participants included 201 Black men ages 40–75 years recruited in New York City during 2006–2007. Main measures: The primary measures included: race-based medical mistrust, health care participation, avoidance of health care, perceived access to health care, health care satisfaction, racial identity, residential racial segregation, attitudes towards prostate cancer screening, and past prostate cancer screening behavior. Key results: An exploratory factor analysis suggested a three-factor structure. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor model. Internal consistency was high for the total GBMMS and the three sub-scales: Suspicion, Discrimination, and Lack of Support. Construct validity was supported by: significant positive correlations between GBMMS and avoidance of health care and racial identity as well as significant negative correlations with health care access, health care satisfaction, and attitudes about prostate cancer screening. ANOVA showed that the GBMMS was associated with greater residential racial segregation. Higher total GBMMS scores were associated with not visiting a physician in the last year and not having a regular physician. Conclusions: The present findings provide strong additional evidence that the GBMMS is a valid and reliable measure that may be used among urban Black men.

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine the added risk of opioid problem use (OPU) in youth with marijuana/alcohol problem use (MAPU). Methods: A total of 475 youth (ages 14-21 years) with OPU + MAPU were compared to a weighted sample of 475 youth with MAPU only (i.e. no OPU) before and after propensity score matching on gender, age, race, level of care and weekly use of marijuana/alcohol. Youth were recruited from 88 drug treatment sites participating in eight Center for Substance Abuse Treatment-funded grants. At treatment intake, participants were administered the Global Appraisal of Individual Need to elicit information on demographic, social, substance, mental health, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), physical and legal characteristics. Odds ratios with confidence intervals were calculated. Results: The added risk of OPU among MAPU youth was associated with greater comorbidity; higher rates of psychiatric symptoms and trauma/victimization; greater needle use and sex-related HIV risk behaviors; and greater physical distress. The OPU + MAPU group was less likely to be African American or other race and more likely to be aged 15-17 years, Caucasian; report weekly drug use at home and among peers; engage in illegal behaviors and be confined longer; have greater substance abuse severity and polydrug use; and use mental health and substance abuse treatment services. Conclusions: These findings expand upon the existing literature and highlight the substantial incremental risk of OPU on multiple comorbid areas among treatment-seeking youth. Further evaluation is needed to assess their outcomes following standard drug treatment and to evaluate specialized interventions for this subgroup of severely impaired youth.

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a community-based healthy weight intervention on child weight and fitness. Cambridge Public Schools (CPS) have monitored BMI and fitness annually since 2000. Annual increases of overweight and obesity from 2000 (37.0%) to 2004 (39.1%), triggered a multidisciplinary team of researchers, educators, health care, and public health professionals to mobilize environmental and policy interventions. Guided by the social-ecological model and community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles, the team developed and implemented Healthy Living Cambridge Kids (HLCK), a multicomponent intervention targeting community, school, family, and individuals. The intervention included city policies and community awareness campaigns; physical education (PE) enhancements, food service reforms, farm-to-school-to-home programs; and family outreach and “BMI and fitness reports”. Baseline (2004) to follow-up (2007) evaluation design assessed change in children’s weight and fitness status. A cohort of 1,858 K-5th grade children participated: 37.3% black, 14.0% Hispanic, 37.1% white, 10.2% Asian, 1.7% other race; 43.3% were lower income. BMI z-score (0.67–0.63 P < 0.001) and proportion obese (20.2–18.0% P < 0.05) decreased, and mean number of fitness tests (0–5) passed increased (3.7–3.9 P < 0.001). Whereas black and Hispanic children were more likely to be obese at baseline (27.0 and 28.5%, respectively) compared with white (12.6%) and Asian (14.3%) children, obesity among all race/ethnicity groups declined. Concurrent with a 3-year community intervention, modest improvements in obesity and fitness were observed among CPS children from baseline to follow-up. The CBPR approach facilitated sustaining policies and program elements postintervention in this diverse community. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Marijuana use in adolescents is associated with many adverse outcomes, including neurobiological and health consequences. Despite this, little is known about gender differences in the correlates of adolescent marijuana use. This study attempted to fill this gap by examining gender differences in the correlates of lifetime and past 30-day marijuana use. Data from a cross-sectional statewide survey of adolescent risk behavior participation in Connecticut were analyzed using χ² and hierarchical logistic regression methodologies to examine the demographic, psychosocial, and risk behavior correlates of adolescent marijuana use. Gender-by-trait interactions were tested with hierarchical logistic regression. Of the 4523 participants (51.8% females, 75.8% white), 40.4% endorsed lifetime marijuana use and 24.5% endorsed past 30-day marijuana use. Risk behavior participation, particularly other substance use, had the most robust associations with lifetime and past 30-day adolescent marijuana use; participation in extracurricular activities seemed protective. Gender interactions were observed for African American, Asian, or other race and participation in extracurricular activities; in these 3 cases, males had a greater likelihood of use. They were also observed for having a job (lifetime use only), with females having elevated odds, and past 30-day cigarette smoking (past 30-day use only), with males having elevated odds. Finally, there was preliminary evidence of a faster transition from initiation of marijuana use to regular use in females, when compared with males. These results indicate important gender differences in the correlates of marijuana use in adolescents, and these findings may facilitate the development of gender-informed prevention and early intervention programs for adolescent marijuana use.

Abstract = {Reliability, content, and homogeneity of own- and other-race impressions were assessed: US White, US Black, and Korean students rated faces of White, Black, or Korean men. High intraracial reliabilities revealed that people of one race showed equally high agreement regarding the traits of own- and other-race faces. Racially universal appearance stereotypes (the attractiveness halo effect and the babyface overgeneralization effect) contributed substantially to interracial agreement, which was only marginally lower than intraracial agreement. Moreover, similar attention to variations in appearance yielded similar degrees of own- and other-race trait differentiation. When own- and other-race differences in the differentiation of faces on babyfaceness were statistically controlled, differences in trait differentiation were eliminated. Despite the individual impressions of other-race faces, certain racial stereotypes persisted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objectives: We sought to examine racial and ethnic disparities in the recognition of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Methods: Within a multisite network, 2568 children aged 8 years were identified as meeting surveillance criteria for ASD through abstraction of evaluation records from multiple sources. Through logistic regression with random effects for site, we estimated the association between race/ethnicity and documented ASD, adjusting for gender, IQ, birthweight, and maternal education. Results: Fifty-eight percent of children had a documented autism spectrum disorder. In adjusted analyses, children who were Black (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64, 0.96), Hispanic (OR = 0.76; CI = 0.56, 0.99), or of other race/ethnicity (OR = 0.65; CI = 0.43, 0.97) were less likely than were White children to have a documented ASD. This disparity persisted for Black children, regardless of IQ, and was concentrated for children of other ethnicities when IQ was lower than 70. Conclusions: Significant racial/ethnic dispatrities exist in the recognition of ASD. For some children in some racial/ethnic groups, the presence of intellectual disability may affect professionals’ further assessment of developmental delay. Our findings suggest the need for continued professional education related to the heterogeneity of the presentation of ASD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Two experiments are reported that examine the effect on later recognition of presenting simultaneously several targets of different ethnicity. In experiment 1, a novel target presentation method was used where participants (children, n = 65 and young adults, n = 62) were shown a stimulus face sheet of four different race faces followed by a sequential larger (target present/absent) multi-ethnic recognition set. In experiment 2 three different sequential presentation methods were compared in young adults (n = 225) that consisted of either (i) make decision ('seen before' vs 'not seen before') for each of the faces in the whole sequential recognition set; or (ii) make only 'seen before' decisions for the whole sequential recognition set; or (iii) a separate sequential lineup for each ethnicity where for each lineup the participants saw all the faces in that lineup and then had to make a decision (target present or absent). Own-race faces were more often correctly rejected (and less falsely identified in experiment 2) than other-race faces. For other-race faces, correct recognition decreased when similar foils were presented before targets in the recognition set but this did not occur for own-race faces. The effect of sequential lineup presentation method emerged for other-race faces favouring separate ethnicity lineups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In Caucasian individuals, holistic processing and face recognition is lateralized to the right hemisphere, whereas part-based processing and word recognition is lateralized to the left hemisphere. Whether this hemispheric complementarity holds more generally is unclear. We compare the hemispheric basis of holistic processing of faces in Caucasian and Chinese observers (who, as readers of logographic script, may have different hemispheric organization). Participants made same/different judgements about the left/right halves of two sequentially presented composite faces (comprised of the left half of one face and the right half of another face) when the halves were aligned or were misaligned. There was a larger congruency effect for aligned than misaligned faces, reflecting significant holistic processing, and this was equivalent for face halves judged in the right and left visual fields and for Caucasian and Chinese observers. This same result was replicated in a second study with Caucasian observers, in which we presented the cue simultaneous with the study face, rather than simultaneous with the test face. These findings reflect equal participation of both hemispheres in holistic face perception and suggest that orthographic experience does not necessarily affect the hemispheric basis of holistic processing.

Abstract = {Personal characteristics that interact with both HIV diagnosis and its medical management can influence symptom experience. Little is known about how symptoms in populations with chronic illness vary by age, sex, or socioeconomic factors. As part of an ongoing prospective longitudinal study, this report describes symptoms experienced by 317 men and women living with HIV/ AIDS. Participants were recruited at HIV clinics and community sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. Measures included the most recent CD4 cell count and viral load from the medical record, demographic and treatment variables, and the 32-item Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale to estimate prevalence, severity, and distress of each symptom and global symptom burden. The median number of symptoms was nine, and symptoms experienced by more than half the sample population included lack of energy (65%), drowsiness (57%), difficulty sleeping (56%), and pain (55%). Global symptom burden was unrelated to age or CD4 cell count. Those with an AIDS diagnosis had significantly higher symptom burden scores, as did those currently receiving antiretroviral therapy. African Americans reported fewer symptoms than Caucasians or Mixed/ Other race, and women reported more symptom burden after controlling for AIDS diagnosis and race. Because high symptom burden is more likely to precipitate self-care strategies that may potentially be ineffective, strategies for symptom management would be better guided by tailored interventions from health care providers.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of race, geographic distance and quality on the choice of community mental health programs. The study population was comprised of adult Medicaid recipients who received outpatient treatment for serious mental illness in FY 2001. A discrete choice model was employed to examine the likelihood of choosing one program over another. Quality was measured based on follow-up after hospital discharge and continuity of care in outpatient services. Maps showing the relationship between race and the quality of care were prepared to visually confirm the results of the statistical analysis. African American and Hispanic clients were less likely to travel further for treatment, while no significant difference was found between the Caucasian and other race groups. Caucasian subjects were more likely to choose programs with a higher quality of care compared to Hispanic or African American clients. Higher income clients were, on average, traveling longer and receiving better quality of care after controlling for race. The results suggested that clients living in higher income White neighborhoods are more likely to travel longer distances for mental health treatment. Special attention must be paid to improve the quality of care in lower income minority neighborhoods to insure equity of treatment in publicly funded programs.

Abstract = {Background: The purpose of this research study was to identify factors that affect mental health care for children with special health care needs (CSHCN) and to identify how these factors vary among different socioeconomic levels. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, 2000–2002. The analysis examined the relationships of demographic characteristics, geographical location of household, severity of condition, and social factors on unmet need for mental health care. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed for four socioeconomic status (SES) levels defined by the federal poverty level (FPL): <133%; 133–199%; 200–299%; ≥300%. Standardized regression coefficients were calculated to compare among SES strata. Results: There were 38,866 CSHCNs represented in the survey with 9,639 needing mental health care in the past 12 months. The household income distribution was 22% below the 133% FPL, 15% between 133–199% FPL, 18% between 200–299% FPL, and 45% at or above 300% FPL. Black race, ethnicity, insurance type/status, geographical location of household, and number of kids in the household were significant in the <133% of FPL stratum for predicting having received all needed mental health care in the last 12 months. Age and geographical location of household were significant in the 133–199% of FPL stratum. Maternal education was significant in the 200–299% of FPL stratum. Severity of condition, other race, and insurance type/status were significant in the ≥300% of FPL stratum. Conclusions: Factors affecting unmet needs for mental health care differed by socioeconomic status. Future research should explore a more in-depth picture of the CSHCN population that includes stratification by income groups to better understand and serve this population.

Abstract = {This article examines factors that influence employment and earnings growth for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries who have participated in the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program. Using hierarchical linear and nonlinear modeling (HLM), the authors examined the employment status of these individuals 2 years after exiting the VR program by using state-level economic and VR agency factors, as well as such individual-level factors as demographics, disabilities, and service types. HLM also was used to examine earnings growth among SSI beneficiaries who sustained employment for 5 years after exiting VR. Findings showed that SSI participants with mental retardation exhibited the highest odds of employment among other disability groups 2 years after exiting the VR program. College or university training and job placement services decreased the odds of employment, whereas supported employment demonstrated increased odds. For SSI participants with sustained employment, African American VR consumers showed higher earnings when compared to other race groups. Among selected VR services, only college or university training was positively associated with earnings growth over time. The authors discuss these and other state-level findings in the context of prior and future research, practice, and policies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Unfamiliar faces from the viewer's own ethnic group are more accurately recognized than other-race faces. The present study examined whether similar effects occur for own-age versus other-age faces, analyzing both behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) measures. Young and elderly participants were to recognize previously studied young and old faces. Whereas young participants demonstrated enhanced recognition memory for own-age faces, no corresponding effect was observed in elderly participants. During recognition tests, enhanced N170 and decreased P2 amplitudes were observed for old faces. Of particular importance, increased N250 amplitudes at right occipito-temporal electrodes as well as enhanced centro-parietal old/new recognition memory effects (more positive ERPs to hits than correct rejections) were observed to own-age compared to other-age faces in the young but not in the elderly participants' ERPs. In young participants, the right occipito-temporal N250 suggests easier access to temporary structural representations for young as compared to old faces, whereas the centro-parietal old/new recognition effect (400-600 ms) suggests an advantage in retrieving episodic information for young faces. The early (<300 ms) neuro-cognitive correlates of the own-age bias in young participants were similar to those of an own-race bias studied previously, suggesting that similar mechanisms underlie these face memory biases. The results are discussed with respect to a perceptual learning account, in which asymmetrical perceptual experience of young and elderly people with faces from different age groups may underlie the differential pattern of own-age effects.

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine perceived quality of life in a diverse population of elderly adults with late‐life disability. Design: Qualitative cross‐sectional study. Setting: Community‐dwelling participants were recruited from San Francisco's On Lok Life ways program, the first Program of All‐inclusive Care for the Elderly. On Lok enrollees meet Medicaid criteria for nursing home placement. Participants: Sixty‐two elderly adults with a mean age of 78 and a mean 2.4 activity of daily living dependencies and 6.6 instrumental activity of daily living dependencies were interviewed. Respondents were 63% female, 24% white, 19% black, 18% Latino, 32% Chinese American, and 6% other race. Measurements: Elderly adults who scored higher than 17 points on the Mini‐Mental State Examination were interviewed. Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish, and Cantonese. Respondents were asked to rate their overall quality of life on a 5‐point scale. Open‐ended questions explored positive and negative aspects of participants’ daily experiences. Interviews were analyzed using modified grounded theory and digital coding software. Results: Eighty‐seven percent of respondents rated their quality of life in the middle range of the quality‐of‐life spectrum (fair to very good). Themes were similar across ethnic groups. Most themes could be grouped into four domains that dependent elderly adults considered important to their quality of life: physical (e.g., pain), psychological (e.g., depression), spiritual or religious (e.g., religious coping), and social (e.g., life‐space). Dignity and a sense of control were identified as themes that are the most closely tied to overall quality of life. Conclusion: Factors that influence quality of life in late‐life disability were similar across ethnic groups. As the number of elderly adults from diverse backgrounds with late life disability increases in the United States, interventions should be targeted to maximize daily sense of control and dignity.

A sample of White college students was exposed to 1 of 3 music genres during an ostensible waiting period, and was then asked to allocate funding to projects for different ethnic groups. Three music conditions—radical White power rock, mainstream rock, and Top 40 pop music—were examined to determine whether differential allocations to ethnic groups would emerge following music exposure. As expected, Top 40 pop music exposure led to equal allocations to the various ethnic groups. After listening to mainstream rock, participants allocated significantly higher budgets to White Americans compared to all other race groups. After listening to radical White power rock music, participants also allocated significantly higher budgets to White Americans, but changes in allocations to ethnic minority groups also emerged. Namely, African Americans and Arab Americans received particularly low funding from participants exposed to radical White power rock music.

The own-race advantage in facial recognition also is shown consistently but not clearly explained. This study tested the hypothesis that the levels of processing findings in facial recognition are a result of interest and attention, not differences in processing. This hypothesis was tested for both own and other faces with 105 Caucasian students. Students were asked to answer 1 of 4 types of study questions (deep or shallow processing questions) while viewing the study faces. Students' recognition of a subset of previously presented Caucasian and African-American faces was tested. They indicated their interest in and attention to the task. The typical levels of processing effect was observed (better recognition performance in the deep conditions) for both own- and other-race faces. The typical own-race advantage also was observed regardless of level of processing condition. For both own- and other-race faces, level of processing explained a significant portion of the recognition variance above and beyond what was explained by interest in and attention to the task.

Abstract = {The effect of inversion on recognition of "own race" (high expertise) and "other race" (low expertise) faces was compared in 2 experiments involving 100 Chinese and European high school and university students. In Exp 1, there was a larger inversion effect in reaction time (RT) for recognition of own-race faces than other-race faces, for both European and Chinese Ss. In Exp 2, a larger own-race inversion effect was found for recognition accuracy, when test face pairs were randomly selected, but not when they were matched on isolated features. Results are largely consistent with the hypothesis of R. Diamond and S. Carey (see record [rid]1986-21075-001[/rid]) that expertise is associated with greater use of configural information in faces.

Abstract = {Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NLSF), we examine both between- and within-group differences in the odds of feeling intraracially harassed. Specifically, we investigate the effects of colleges’ and universities’ racial composition as well as the nature of students’ associations with non-group members, including involvement in racially homogeneous campus organizations, ethnoracial diversity of friendship networks, and interracial dating. Our findings suggest that although college racial composition appears to have little effect on experiencing intraracial harassment, the nature of students’ involvement with other-race students matters a great deal. For all groups, interracial dating increased odds of harassment. Among black and white students, more diverse friendship networks did as well. And among Asian and Latino students, involvement in any racially homogeneous campus organization was associated with increases in reports of intraracial harassment. Thus, we propose a baseline theoretical model of intraracial harassment that highlights the nature of students’ associations with outgroups.

Abstract = {Previous research on adolescent girls in relationships with older partners suggests a range of negative outcomes for the adolescent. Using three waves of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health and a life course perspective, we explore the connection between involvement in age discordant relationships (girls dating males three or more years older) and the course of depressive symptoms among adolescent girls. Our analyses are conducted on the 1,307 girls with data at all three waves who had been in a relationship in the last 18 months. The sample is 55% White, 22% Black, 7% other race and 16% Latina. When comparing early adolescent girls (13–15) and late adolescent girls (16–18), the younger girls are no more likely to have depressive symptoms before entry into the age discordant relationship, yet have greater depressive symptoms shortly after the relationship onset and 5 years later. Older adolescent girls in age discordant relationships, however, have similar levels of depressive symptoms at any time point relative to their peers. These data suggest that a girl’s developmental stage influences whether or not she experiences emotional distress as a result of being in an age discordant relationship.

Abstract = {Adjusting to chronic illness is very complicated for families with children, as they are already faced with the challenge of development and childrearing. In this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with HIV positive mothers on a number of issues related to being an HIV positive mother raising young children. One topic of the interview was whether or not they felt that HIV had caused them to miss activities with their children while the children were growing up, what types of activities they had missed, the age of the child for each example, and how HIV had led to missing these activities. Interviews were conducted in 2008 with a random sample of 57 mothers being followed in a longitudinal assessment study. All study participants were English or Spanish speaking. Mean age was 44.1 (SD = 5.6) years; 47% were Latina; 35% African American; 11% White; and 7% other race. About 60% of the mothers disclosed that their HIV status had caused them to miss out on activities with their children while their children were growing up, ranging from daily care activities to major school and extra-curricular activities. Some mothers missed significant amounts of time with their children due to hospitalizations. In some cases mothers felt forced into a choice between mothering ability and their own health, including adherence to medications. Implications for the mothers and the children are discussed.

Abstract = {Background: On November 16, 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released new breast cancer screening recommendations, resulting in considerable controversy. Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the volume and framing of the public discourse around the mammography recommendations and determine if women were knowledgeable about the new recommendations. Methods: Two different types of data collection methods were used for this study: (1) a content analysis of news stories and social media posts around the time of the USPSTF announcement and (2) a web-based survey of women aged 40–74 years conducted through Knowledge Networks from December 17, 2009, to January 6, 2010. Data were analyzed in 2010. Results: The survey sample included 1221 women aged 40–74 years who had never had breast cancer. The majority of the articles and posts (51.9%) did not support the screening recommendations, and 17.6% were supportive. Less than one quarter of the sample could identify the new recommendations for women aged 40–49 years and 50–74 years. Results from logistic regression analyses identified characteristics associated with correct knowledge of the recommendations for each age group. Level of attention paid to the recommendations was significantly associated with accurate knowledge of the recommendations for each age group. Having a mammogram within the past 2 years, “other” race (i.e., not black or white), and having higher levels of education, confidence that recommendations were based on the latest research, and attention paid to the new guidelines were all significantly and positively associated with correct knowledge of the new recommendation for women aged 40–49 years. Conclusions: The new recommendations confused women (30.0%) more than they helped them understand when to get a mammogram (6.2%). Confusion was greatest among women aged 40–49 years and women who had never had a mammogram or who had one more than 2 years ago. Communication about future recommendations should be pretested to identify strategies and language that may reduce confusion among providers, consumers, and advocacy groups.

Abstract = {We examined racial/ethnic differences in reported seroadaptive and serodisclosure behaviors among the partnerships of MSM recruited for a cross-sectional survey using time-location sampling (TLS) in San Francisco during 2007–2008. The sample (N = 1,199) consisted of 12.2% Asian/Pacific Islander (API), 52.4% White, 6.8% Black, 20.2% Latino, and 8.5% of “other” race/ethnicity. Pure serosorting was most common (about 20%) among HIV-negative men while seropositioning was most used (about 15%) by HIV-positive men. Reported seroadaptive behaviors did not differ significantly across races/ethnicities among both HIV-negative and HIV-positive men. However, HIV-positive Black and Latino men were significantly more likely to report no preventive, seroadaptive behavioral strategy (i.e., unprotected insertive anal intercourse with unknown status or serodiscordant partners). Among men who reported engaging in seroadaptive behaviors, they reported not discussing HIV status with a third of their partners—a major concern in that lack of disclosure undermines the effectiveness and means to practice serosorting. Partnerships of API and Black men were least likely to involve serodisclosure behaviors. Our study confirms that seroadaptive behaviors are common preventive strategies reported by MSM of all races/ethnicities, and does not find strong evidence that racial/ethnic differences in seroadaptive behaviors are enhancing disparities in HIV prevalence. The implications are that condom promotion and safe sex messages are not the only prevention measures adopted by MSM and that public health professionals should be well aware of current trends within the MSM community in order to better assist HIV prevention efforts.

Abstract = {Objective: To describe the implementation of a Fetal and Infant Mortality Review (FIMR) in a small urban community to improve perinatal birth outcomes. Design: Descriptive study. Setting: Urban community within a Wisconsin city, population 85,000. Participants: Between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, all women (N = 82) in a targeted five zip‐code area within an urban city were identified who experienced a fetal loss >14 weeks, neonatal or infant death (< 1 year of age). Methods: The National Fetal and Infant Mortality Review Manual: A Guide for Communities developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (2008) provided the framework for the systematic review of available records for all fetal and infant deaths during a 2‐year period. Based on these findings, targeted evidence‐based interventions were implemented. Results: The infant mortality rate was higher in two of the five targeted zip‐code areas. The mean ages of women who experienced fetal and infant mortality were in their 20s as opposed to teenage mothers. A higher proportion of Black women experienced fetal/perinatal losses than other race/ethnicities, many of which were related to prematurity. Conclusions: Many social, environmental, and maternal health issues such as poverty, racism, and perception of stress negatively contributed to the general health of women's subsequent birth outcomes. Nurses have the opportunity to promote and improve health to eliminate racial disparities in birth outcomes within their communities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Evidence from recent laboratory experiments suggests that ethnic identification can lead to negative evaluations of ethnic minorities (Kaiser & Pratt-Hyatt, 2009). The current research considers the generalizability of these findings to face-to-face interactions in contexts wherein impression management concerns are salient: the workplace hiring process. In a field experiment, Black, Hispanic, and Irish individuals applied for retail jobs with or without visible display of their ethnic identification. Analysis of indicators of formal (e.g., application offering, interview scheduling) and interpersonal discrimination (e.g., interaction length, nonverbal negativity) suggest store personnel interacting with other-race applicants exhibited greater positivity and longer interactions when applicants displayed ethnic identification than when they did not. The findings suggest that psychologists need to understand not only attitudes or intentions expressed in the lab, but also the behavioral consequences of manifest group identity as they unfold in natural environments.

Abstract = {Background: Studies using local samples suggest that racial minorities anticipate a greater preference for life sustaining treatment when faced with a terminal illness. These studies are limited by size, representation, and insufficient exploration of sociocultural covariables. Objective: To explore racial and ethnic differences in concerns and preferences for medical treatment at the end of life in a national sample, adjusting for sociocultural covariables. Design: Dual-language (English/Spanish), mixed mode (telephone/mail) survey. Participants: A total of 2,847 of 4,610 eligible community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older on July 1, 2003 (62% response). Measurements: Demographics, education, financial strain, health status, social networks, perceptions of health-care access, quality, and the effectiveness of mechanical ventilation (MV), and concerns and preferences for medical care in the event the respondent had a serious illness and less than 1 year to live. Results: Respondents included 85% non-Hispanic whites, 4.6% Hispanics, 6.3% blacks, and 4.2% “other” race/ethnicity. More blacks (18%) and Hispanics (15%) than whites (8%) want to die in the hospital; more blacks (28%) and Hispanics (21.2%) than whites (15%) want life prolonging drugs that make them feel worse all the time; fewer blacks (49%) and Hispanics (57%) than whites (74%) want potentially life-shortening palliative drugs, and more blacks (24%, 36%) and Hispanics (22%, 29%) than whites (13%, 21%) want MV for life extension of 1 week or 1 month, respectively. In multivariable analyses, sociodemographic variables, preference for specialists, and an overly optimistic belief in the effectiveness of MV explained some of the greater preferences for life-sustaining drugs and mechanical ventilation among non-whites. Black race remained an independent predictor of concern about receiving too much treatment [adjusted OR = 2.0 (1.5–2.7)], preference for dying in a hospital [AOR = 2.3 (1.6–3.2)], receiving life-prolonging drugs [1.9 (1.4–2.6)], MV for 1 week [2.3 (1.6–3.3)] or 1 month’s [2.1 (1.6–2.9)] life extension, and a preference not to take potentially life shortening palliative drugs [0.4 (0.3–0.5)]. Hispanic ethnicity remained an independent predictor of preference for dying in the hospital [2.2 (1.3–4.0)] and against potentially life-shortening palliative drugs [0.5 (0.3–0.7)]. Conclusions: Greater preference for intensive treatment near the end of life among minority elders is not explained fully by confounding sociocultural variables. Still, most Medicare beneficiaries in all race/ethnic groups prefer not to die in the hospital, to receive life prolonging drugs that make them feel worse all the time, or to receive MV.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the self-reported experiences of an adult population living in the community, as they relate to alcohol use and potential negative outcomes (emotional/physical problems, role function problems, drinking and driving, risk behaviors, and alcohol abuse/dependence). Analyses focused on 37,026 individuals that are weighted to the population of 212,686,651 drawn from a large representative cross-sectional survey of the US. population—the 2003 National Survey on Drug Use and health (NSDUH). Alcohol use of 1–9 drinks in the past month showed a significant increase in the odds ratios for most of the study outcomes compared to those who did not drink alcohol. As alcohol use increased, the odds ratios for all of the study outcomes linearly increased. Mental health symptoms and illicit drug use in the past year also significantly increased the odds ratios for all of the study outcomes. Hispanic and other race reflected an increased odds ratio for alcohol caused role function problems, when compared to Caucasians. Higher income and education levels increased the odds ratios for drinking and driving. Negative consequences occur at low levels of self-reported monthly alcohol use, when binge and heavy drinking are not present. An increase in alcohol consumption reflects a linear increase in the odds ratios for alcohol related problems. Nursing professionals need to be aware of the importance in educating clients about the risks associated with alcohol consumption. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This report summarizes National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system (NHBS) data from 2008, which indicated that, of 8,153 MSM interviewed and tested in the 21 MSAs participating in NHBS that year, HIV prevalence was 19%, with non-Hispanic blacks having the highest prevalence (28%), followed by Hispanics (18%), non-Hispanic whites (16%), and persons who were multiracial or of other race (17%). Of those who were infected, 44% were unaware of their infection. Men who know their current HIV infection status can be linked to appropriate medical care and prevention services. In2008,a total of28,468 men were approached, and 12,325 were screened for participation in NHBS at 626 venues in 21 MSAs. Among the 8,153 MSM tested, 1,562 (19%) tested positive for HIV (range by MSA: 6%-38%). HIV prevalence was 28% among blacks, 18% among Hispanics, and 16% among whites. HIV prevalence increased with increasing age and decreased with increasing education and income. Results indicated that the overall HIV prevalence was 27%, and 48% of HIV positive participants were unaware of their infection. HIV prevalence among blacks was 40%; 63% were unaware of their infection. These prevalence rates were similar to those from 2004-2005 NHBS data; the proportion of MSM unaware of their infection did not increase.

Abstract = {Extant research suggests that targets' emotion expressions automatically evoke similar affect in perceivers. The authors hypothesized that the automatic impact of emotion expressions depends on group membership. In Experiments 1 and 2, an affective priming paradigm was used to measure immediate and preconscious affective responses to same-race or other-race emotion expressions. In Experiment 3, spontaneous vocal affect was measured as participants described the emotions of an ingroup or outgroup sports team fan. In these experiments, immediate and spontaneous affective responses depended on whether the emotional target was ingroup or outgroup. Positive responses to fear expressions and negative responses to joy expressions were observed in outgroup perceivers, relative to ingroup perceivers. In Experiments 4 and 5, discrete emotional responses were examined. In a lexical decision task (Experiment 4), facial expressions of joy elicited fear in outgroup perceivers, relative to ingroup perceivers. In contrast, facial expressions of fear elicited less fear in outgroup than in ingroup perceivers. In Experiment 5, felt dominance mediated emotional responses to ingroup and outgroup vocal emotion. These data support a signal-value model in which emotion expressions signal environmental conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {National surveys indicate that American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) women have higher rates of rape and sexual assault victimisation compared to women from other race/ethnic groups. These statistics were brought to the forefront of media attention when an Amnesty International (2007) report illuminated the obstacles many AIAN women have when seeking justice for rape victimisations. Despite this attention, empirical research that examines rape and sexual assault against AIAN women is still in its infancy. The purpose of this article is twofold. We first provide a methodological review of the epidemiological research that has attempted to measure the magnitude of rape against AIAN women at both national and local levels. We then examine National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data to determine how the contextual characteristics of rape and sexual assault victimisations against AIAN women differ from those of African American and White women. Results indicate that AIAN victims are more likely to face armed offenders, and more likely require medical care for injuries sustained as a result of the attack. Sexual assaults against AIAN women are also more likely to be interracial and the offender is more likely to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, compared to attacks against other victims. Although victimisations against AIAN women are more likely to come to the attention of police, they are much less likely to result in an arrest compared to attacks against either White or African American victims. Directions for future research are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {HIV prevalence among women in South Africa continues to be high despite the availability of a comprehensive plan for the control of HIV/AIDS and a plethora of prevention programmes. Any explanation for the ongoing high HIV prevalence continues to be elusive. The objective of this study was to understand the relationship between HIV, gender, race and socioeconomic status among South African public sector educators in order to inform prevention programmes. A cross-sectional survey involving a probability sample of 1,766 schools out of 26,713 in the Department of Education Register of School Needs was selected. A sample of 24,200 respondents out of 356,749 public sector educators participated in the study. Nurses registered with the South African Nursing Council were recruited, trained to conduct interviews and to collect specimens for HIV testing. The study found an association between HIV, gender, race and socioeconomic status among educators. African educators showed a higher HIV prevalence than other race groups. Among females, the highest HIV prevalence was among educators aged 25-35 years and in males aged 36-49 years. Further, educators with a high income and educational qualifications had a lower HIV prevalence compared to educators with low income and low educational qualifications, regardless of sex. Migration and marital factors were also found to play a role in HIV infection. The results suggest that HIV prevention needs to take into account critical issues around empowerment of vulnerable groups such as women and certain race groups to be able to implement safe sexual practices and therefore reduce HIV infections.

Abstract = {Objective: Recent US data indicate that women of Vietnamese descent have higher cervical cancer incidence rates than women of any other race/ethnicity, and lower levels of Pap testing than white, black, and Latina women. Our objective was to provide information about Pap testing barriers and facilitators that could be used to develop cervical cancer control intervention programs for Vietnamese American women. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional, community-based survey of Vietnamese immigrants. Our study was conducted in metropolitan Seattle, Washington, DC. A total of 1532 Vietnamese American women participated in the study. Demographic, health care, and knowledge/belief items associated with previous cervical cancer screening participation (ever screened and screened according to interval screening guidelines) were examined. Results: Eighty-one percentage of the respondents had been screened for cervical cancer in the previous three years. Recent Pap testing was strongly associated (p < 0.001) with having a regular doctor, having a physical in the last year, previous physician recommendation for testing, and having asked a physician for testing. Women whose regular doctor was a Vietnamese man were no more likely to have received a recent Pap smear than those with no regular doctor. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that cervical cancer screening disparities between Vietnamese and other racial/ethnic groups are decreasing. Efforts to further increase Pap smear receipt in Vietnamese American communities should enable women without a source of health care to find a regular provider. Additionally, intervention programs should improve patient-provider communication by encouraging health care providers (especially male Vietnamese physicians serving women living in ethnic enclaves) to recommend Pap testing, as well as by empowering Vietnamese women to specifically ask their physicians for Pap testing.

In the article the original article on page 394, three values of Table 3 underneath the column of "OLS Hour of Bedtime" were incorrect.The correct OLS Hour of Bedtime for Mother is Hispanic (vs. white), Mother is black (vs. white), and Mother is of other race (vs. white) should read: .247***, .135**, and .411***, respectively, whereas *p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001. This error has been noted in the online version of the article, which is available at www.jdbp.org.] Objective: To examine the associations of child and family sociodemographic characteristics with preschooler bedtime routines. Method: We use parent-report data of 3217 3-year-old children (48% black, 26% Hispanic, and 22% white) from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine whether child and family characteristics are associated with the presence, time, and consistency of bedtime routines. Results: More than 80% of sample children have a bedtime yet only two thirds follow it. After extensive controls for maternal education, family structure, and other household characteristics, black and Hispanic children have later bedtimes than white children and reduced odds of using regular bedtimes (by 22% and 29%, respectively) and using bedtime routines (by 47% and 33%, respectively). Low maternal education, increased household size, and poverty are associated with decreased use of parent-child interactive and hygiene-related bedtime routines. Conclusion: Children from disadvantaged households are less likely to have consistent bedtime routines than their more advantaged counterparts. This may contribute to later disparities in sleep quality, duration and timing, factors known to be associated with adverse behavioral, cognitive, and health outcomes.

Abstract = {This study was made on New York City negro and white public grammar school children. Race preference is weaker and more variable in the first four grades, but is significantly present in both races in the second grade. Even when race withdrawal does not occur, color preference may be present. Younger classes accord more prestige to the other race than do older ones. Even when exhibiting preference for their own group, they are likely to confer special popularity on a member of the other group. The role played by intimacy in the relationship between the races leads to a differentiation between primary self-preference, derived from indoctrination, and secondary self-preference, based on rejection by the other race in the school situation. It is concluded that attitudes leading to race cleavage are initiated by the community and assimilated much more fully by whites than by colored children in the schools. In its development cleavage is a special form of the general age-increase of mutual relationships which occurs in school classes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

A total of 1 119 black African, coloured, Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking white learners were surveyed, using three measures of intergroup prejudice, a self-report intergroup contact measure and a racial identification scale. In general, quality of contact with individuals of other race groups and an increase in contact both in and outside of the school improved learners' race attitudes. Higher levels of demographic integration within schools were also positively related to race attitudes, but a high degree of identification with one's own race led in several instances to less positive attitudes towards other race groups. Intergroup contact seemed to be the single most important predictor of attitudes for all four groups in this study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {People are better able to recognize faces of their own race than those of other races. One explanation is that this 'other-race effect' is caused by lifelong experience in which faces from some races are more common than other races. A recent article by N. Furl et al (see record [rid]2002-11188-006[/rid]) tests experience-based accounts of the other-race effect by giving computer algorithms of face recognition training on preponderantly Caucasian faces. The only algorithms that reliably produced other-race effects were those that created face representations distorted to emphasize features that individuated faces. The current author comments that Furl et al's work shows that the memory advantage that people have for faces of their own race need not be due to negative attitudes about other races. It might simply be a side-effect of perceptual systems that have been customized to pick up on diagnostic information in a familiar environment. A goal for future research is to connect other-race advantages and disadvantages with neural and mechanical models of perceptual learning on the one hand and social psychology on the other hand, to provide an example of a bridge between low-level perception and high-level phenomena of stereotyping and prejudice that affect society as a whole.

Abstract = {The goal of this investigation was to determine whether cocaine and ethanol use was a differentiating factor between African American and white teenage suicide victims. This is a retrospective analysis of medical examiner's records of all completed suicides in Fulton County, GA from 01/1989 to 12/2003, and included 1296 cases. There were 79 suicide victims aged 19 and younger during the study interval, and of this group, 49 (62%) were African American, 26 (33%) were white, and 4 (5%) other race, compared to adults (20 ≤ 6 years) where 28.5% were African American, 68.6% white and 2.9% other race (χ² = 42.678, d.f. = 2, p < 0.0001). Of the black teenaged victims, 82.2% had no cocaine or alcohol detected at autopsy, while 41.7% of the white victims were positive for one or both substance (χ² = 4.633, d.f. = 1, p = 0.04). Only 8.9% of the black teenage suicide victims had used cocaine prior to death compared to 28% of the whites (χ² = 4.432; d.f. = 1; p < 0.04). The suicide rate (suicide/100,000/year) for black teens was 5.48 compared to 4.16 for whites, but the rate of cocaine positive teen suicides was 1.12 for whites and 0.45 for blacks. The pattern of cocaine use changes dramatically in the adult group, with 27% of African American suicide victims compared to 7.7% of whites being positive (χ² = 73.272; d.f. = 1; p < 0.001). Use of intoxicating substances does differentiate teenage suicide victims, as only a small proportion of black teenagers had used cocaine or alcohol prior to death compared to almost half of all whites.

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the prevalence and distribution of HIV in South African workplaces. Design: Cross-sectional HIV prevalence and knowledge, attitudes and practices surveys, conducted in 22 public and private sector organizations in all nine provinces of South Africa on full-time, formally employed personnel who provided consent to participate. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was HIV prevalence. Results: The crude HIV prevalence among the 32 015 participants was 10.9%. HIV prevalence was higher among men (11.3%) than among women (9.8%) and among black Africans (16.6%) than among other race groups (2.7%). Although managers and employees with post-school education had a lower HIV prevalence than lower skilled employees, this only partly accounted for the race differences. Conclusion: The HIV prevalence within an organization is not entirely explained by the race, age and sex structure of the workforce. This indicates that there is some other factor that is associated with the organization and has an impact on HIV prevalence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The familiar face overgeneralization hypothesis holds that an own-race positivity bias is, in part, a perceptual by-product of reactions to familiar people versus unfamiliar-looking strangers. Because prototypical facial structure varies across racial groups and communities are often racially segregated, strangers from one's own racial group should appear more familiar than strangers from a different racial group, contributing to ingroup favoritism and negative outgroup stereotypes. As predicted, the lower familiarity of own- than other-race faces mediated Koreans' and White Americans' ingroup favoritism in Study 1 and Black and White Americans' ingroup favoritism in Study 2. Lower familiarity of other-race faces also mediated negative stereotypes of other-race faces and partially suppressed positive ones, with familiarity effects confined to affectively valenced stereotypes. The results suggest that the unfamiliarity of other-race faces contributes not only to ingroup favoritism but also to a dual-process stereotyping in which both cultural beliefs and negative affective reactions to unfamiliarity make a contribution.

Abstract = {Background: Aim of this study was to verify the relationship between attachment and nomination of prosocial and aggressive classmates in Italian children attending ethnically mixed school classes. The hypothesis was that secure children nominate aggressive and prosocial peers independently by their ethnia, while insecure children nominate more own-race than other-race classmates for prosocial behaviour and nominate other-race classmates for aggressive behaviour. Method: Choices of prosocial and aggressive classmates were assessed by Peer Nomination Techniques (Coie, Dodge and Coppotelli, 1982). Attachment Internal Working Models were assessed by Attili modified version of the Separation Anxiety Test (2001). The sample was made up by 354 primary school youngsters: 252 Italian children (mean age 9.2 yrs) and 102 immigrant children (mean age 9.7 yrs). Results: Findings show Italian children with secure, ambivalent and avoidant attachment do not make any distinction among own-race and other-race classmates for prosocial and aggressive behaviour. Confused and disorganized italian children nominate more own-race classmates for prosocial behaviour, while nominate more other-race classmates for aggressive behaviour.

Study 1, which concerned the technique's validity, obtained different attitude estimates for Black and White participants and also revealed that the variability among White participants was predictive of other race-related judgments and behavior. Study 2 concerned the lack of correspondence between the unobtrusive estimates and Modern Racism Scale (MRS) scores. The reactivity of the MRS was demonstrated in Study 3. Study 4 observed an interaction between the unobtrusive estimates and an individual difference in motivation to control prejudiced reactions when predicting MRS scores.

Okada (2007, this issue; see record [rid]2007-18058-001[/rid]) reported that chimpanzees raised with extensive social contact with humans show face discrimination abilities for human faces that exceed those for conspecific faces. Martin-Malivel and Okada have placed this finding in the theoretical context of the relative role of experience and innate face representations. The present article discusses the logic of the various styles of studies relevant to this question-considering primates without prior visual experience, sensitive periods, perceptual narrowing, childhood development, other-species effects, other-race effects, social quality of experience with nonconspecifics, and perceived social group membership-and also reviews the key current data. A case is made that there is still a long way to go in understanding whether there is an innate representation of conspecific faces, how tightly tuned any such representation is to conspecific morphology, and how experience obtained during different age brackets (e.g., infancy versus adulthood) affects discrimination and interacts with any innate representation.

Abstract = {Racial/ethnic residential segregation has been shown to contribute to violence and have harmful consequences for minority groups. However, research examining the segregation–crime relationship has focused almost exclusively on blacks and whites while largely ignoring Latinos and other race/ethnic groups and has rarely considered potential mediators (e.g., concentrated disadvantage) in segregation–violence relationships. This study uses year 2000 arrest data for California and New York census places to extend segregation–crime research by comparing the effects of racial/ethnic residential segregation from whites on black and Latino homicide. Results indicate that (1) racial/ethnic segregation contributes to both Latino and black homicide, and (2) the effects for both groups are mediated by concentrated disadvantage. Implications for segregation–violence relationships, the racial-invariance position, and the Latino paradox are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study details ethnic disparities that exist between American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth and White, African American, and Hispanic/Latino youth based on secondary data analysis of Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey from surveys conducted in 2003, 2005, and 2007. Items were selected for secondary analysis based on their relevance to one of five categories including (a) Violence or delinquent behaviors, (b) substance use, (c) sexual behaviors, (d) experience of victimization, and (f) suicide-related behaviors. The analyses suggest that pervasive levels of disproportionality exist between AI/AN youth and youth of other race/ethnicities on an array of risk items. These differences are most profound between the AI/AN and White youth populations, but also exist in numerous areas between the AI/AN and both African American and Hispanic/Latino youth. The findings highlight elevated levels of victimization, drug use, and suicidal behaviors among AI/AN youth. These data must be filtered through the realities of growing up in Indian Country, and must include positive factors not identified in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey. Future research should focus not only on disparities, but on culturally appropriate interventions that have been successfully used to address the unique trauma experienced by youth living in AI/AN communities.

Abstract = {Objective: The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence, trends, and correlates of physical activity among a national sample of pregnant women. Method: Using data collected from the 1999–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, physical activity and sedentary behaviors were collected during interviews with 1280 pregnant women ≥16 years. Estimates were weighted to reflect the United States population. Results: Overall 22.8% reported any transportation activity (i.e., to/from work/school), 54.3% reported any moderate to vigorous household activity, and 56.6% reported any moderate to vigorous leisure activity, all in the past month. Participation in any transportation and moderate to vigorous leisure activity was stable over time, while participation in any moderate to vigorous household activities and moderate leisure activities increased from 1999–2002 to 2003–06. Moderate to vigorous leisure activity was significantly higher among those in first trimester compared to third trimester, among non-Hispanic white participants compared to women from other race/ethnic groups, and among those with health insurance compared to those without. From 2003 to 2006, 15.3% of pregnant women reported watching 5 h or more of television or videos per day. Conclusion: These data could be used to monitor trends and set national goals for physical activity among pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Body dissatisfaction in women in the United States is common. We explored how women from various racial and ethnic groups used figural stimuli by exploring differences in current and preferred silhouette, and their discrepancy. We surveyed 4023 women aged 25–45 in an online investigation. Participants were identified using a national quota-sampling procedure. Asian women chose a smaller silhouette to represent their current body size, which did not remain significant after adjusting for self-reported BMI. After controlling for BMI, African American women selected a smaller silhouette than White women to represent their current size. Both African American and women reporting “Other” race preferred larger silhouettes than White women even after controlling for BMI. The discrepancy score revealed lower body dissatisfaction among African American than White women. Understanding factors that promote body satisfaction differentially across racial and ethnic groups could become a tool in appropriately tailored interventions designed to prevent eating disorders.

Data from the Speak to Your Health! Community Survey, a community-based survey designed and implemented by university and community partners using Community Based Public Health (CBPH) principles to investigate health and social issues in Genesee County, Michigan, was used in the analysis presented. The survey gathered information on self-reported mental and physical health status, disease diagnoses, health access and utilization, health-promoting and health-adverse behaviors, neighborhood conditions, and other topics. We sampled households in all residential census tracts in Genesee County, Michigan. One resident over 18 years of age was randomly selected within each household and participated in a telephone interview. The total sample size for the telephone survey in 2007 was 1,748. The mean age of the participants was 54.7 (SD = 15.69); 66% of participants were white, 26% African American, and 7% other race/ethnicity; and 15% of the population reported being diagnosed with asthma. Adults with asthma had significantly higher body mass index, higher levels of social support, and higher levels of stress than adults without asthma. Clinicians and researchers should be aware of psychosocial factors affecting their adult patient populations and tailor patient care, communication, and community-based educational interventions to specifically address these.

Abstract = {The importance of conducting substance abuse research among ethnic minorities is underscored by findings that members of many ethnic minorities in the United States report higher rates of heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems than do Whites and have increased rates of illicit drug use, abuse, and dependence. It is important to better understand ethnic-specific substance use from a public health perspective. Recent data suggest that the prevalence of past month alcohol use and heavy alcohol use among Hispanics is lower than and the prevalence of binge drinking and alcohol abuse or dependence is comparable to that of non-Hispanic Whites. These estimates vary among Hispanic subgroups and across gender and age groups. The prevalence of past month illicit drug use is also lower among Hispanics than that of several other groups, including non-Hispanic Whites. These trends are consistent among both men and women, although the prevalence for men is nearly twice that of women in nearly all subgroups. Conversely, the prevalence of illicit drug abuse or dependence among Hispanics is slightly higher than that of non-Hispanic Whites. This article describes national level epidemiological data on the prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug use, abuse, and dependence among Latinos/Hispanics in the United States in comparison to other race and ethnic groups. Previous findings in the literature will be reviewed and new analyses using the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health will be presented. Given the heterogeneity of Hispanics in the United States, data for Hispanics will be broken down by national groups whenever possible. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Some studies in adults indicate a positive correlation between eating later in the day and overall energy intake as well as body weight status. Thus, the time of food intake may be a risk factor in childhood obesity. This study was designed to describe the proportion of energy consumed in the time from 4 pm to midnight measured in two-hour increments and to determine a potential association between the time of proportion of energy consumed and body weight status. Methods: Dietary, anthropometric, and socio-demographic data of 2–18 year olds (N = 11,072) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2004 was examined to describe the proportion of total energy consumed within two-hour time periods between 4 pm and midnight. To examine the potential association between eating later in the day and body weight status, generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were used to quantify the effect of time trends (proportion of total energy consumed in each 2-hour time period from 4 pm to 11.59 pm) on body weight status. Analysis was conducted in the total sample and in subgroups stratified by sex, ethnic group (Non-Hispanic white, Non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, Other Hispanic, and Other Race including multi-racial) and age group (2–5, 6–11, and 12–18 year olds). Complex sample survey analysis were used to assess differences at a significance level of p-value < 0.05. Results: Proportion of energy consumed varied by sex, ethnic group, and age groups between 4 pm and 11.59 pm. Compared to healthy weight children, overweight school-age children consumed significantly higher while overweight adolescents consumed significantly lower proportions of total daily energy with each advancing two-hour time increment. Conclusion: The association between the circadian rhythm of eating and body weight status needs to be investigated further to examine the effect of time of consumption on the risk of childhood obesity. Especially longitudinal studies in diverse child populations would help elucidate the importance of time of eating on obesity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The present work considers the mental imaging of faces, with a focus in own-face imaging. Experiments 1 and 3 demonstrated an own-face disadvantage, with slower generation of mental images of one's own face than of other familiar faces. In contrast, Experiment 2 demonstrated that mental images of facial parts are generated more quickly for one's own face. Finally, Experiment 4 established that a bias toward local processing is advantageous for one's own face, whereas a global-processing bias produces an enhanced own-face disadvantage. The results suggest that own-face imaging is more synchronized with retrieval of face features and less attuned to a face's holistic pattern than is imaging of other people's faces. The authors propose that the salient information for own and other face identification reflects, in part, differences in the purpose and experiences (expertise) generally associated with processing of own and other faces. Consistent with work examining the range of face processing, including other-race faces, our results suggest that not all faces receive the same holistic emphasis.

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined the association of household language use and access to care among children with special health care needs (CSHCN). From this study we describe the demographics of children and the prevalence of selected access characteristics according to their primary household language and examine the independent effects of household language on health care access, unmet needs, and family impact while controlling for confounding variables. Methods: Data from the 2005–2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs, a nationally representative telephone survey of 40723 CSHCN, were analyzed. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to examine disparities and estimate adjusted odds ratios of health care access, satisfaction, and family-impact measures for CSHCN from non–English-primary-language (NEPL) versus English-primary-language (EPL) households. Results: Nearly 14% of all US children live in NEPL households. NEPL CSHCN were significantly more likely to be Hispanic or other race, be poor, have less educated parents, and reside in metropolitan areas and larger households and yet were less likely to be on cash assistance from welfare. Logistic regression showed that NEPL CSHCN were twice as likely to lack access to a medical home, a usual source of care, and family-centered care. They were 4 times as likely to lack health insurance, and their family members were also more likely to lack adequate insurance. Family members of NEPL children were almost twice as likely to have to stop employment as a result of their child's condition. Conclusions: Although limited by program eligibility contingent on immigrant status and state policies, increased referrals to programs such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid can improve access while utilization can be improved by the availability of interpreters, community health workers, linguistically concordant providers, and outreach education efforts of NEPL parents.

Abstract = {Verbal overshadowing is the impairment of a person's recognition ability as a result of generating a verbal description. Two experiments involving 169 participants examined the effects of verbal overshadowing, race of voice (own/other) and cognitive style (holistic/analytic) on voice recognition. In Experiment 1, participants heard a recorded voice (own- or other-race) saying a short phrase. After completing a cognitive style analysis and 15-minute filler task, the verbalisation group gave a written description of the voice while the control group did a filler task. Participants then attempted to identify the voice from a 6-voice lineup tape. Experiment 2 manipulated the similarity of the own-race voices by using telephone recordings of the voices, and the encoding-test similarities of the stimuli by using different phrases at encoding and test. Results showed a strong own-race bias with superior own-race voice recognition and no verbal overshadowing in Experiment 1, and a strong verbal overshadowing effect in Experiment 2. Cognitive style was predictive of voice identification in both experiments. Results are discussed with reference to the own-race bias, cognitive style and encoding-test similarity of the stimulus in verbal overshadowing.

Abstract = {Analyzed the value of simultaneously taking helper and caregiver characteristics into account when examining social support received by spouse caregivers of persons with dementia. This study questions whether sources and types of received support vary by the gender and relationship of the helper and/or by the caregiver's race and gender. Drawing on a sample of 210 spouse caregivers of persons aged 60 yrs and older with dementia, the Generalized Estimating Equation method was used to estimate a population-average logistic regression model to address cross-level helper and caregiver interactions. Results indicate that helper and caregiver characteristics interact in complex ways. White male caregivers were more likely to receive emotional support from adult children and to receive practical assistance from formal sources compared with other types of support and to other race–gender caregiver groups. It is suggested that a description of social status characteristics of caregivers as determinants of their social network may be less fruitful in understanding the benefits of social support than a focus on which helpers assist with what kinds of task for which groups of caregivers.

A booth was set up inviting persons to participate in social psychological research. Ss were 68 Blacks (mean age 27 yrs) and 20 Whites (mean age 33 yrs). The stereotype measure consisted of a checklist of terms which respondents were asked to place a check by to indicate whether they felt the term is true of Blacks, Mexican-Americans, Asian-Americans, or Whites. Results indicate that Blacks have a relatively complex, multidimensional representation of themselves and of Whites. In contrast, and consistent with previous literature, Whites seem to have a more simplistic, and largely negative stereotype of Blacks, while having a more complex view of their own group. Blacks tend to distinguish between male and female stereotypes of their race and the White race, while Whites see Blacks in terms of male stereotypes. Cluster analysis scores are appended.

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine what roles patient–provider and patient–staff racial concordance play on patients’ perceptions within the health care setting. Design, Setting, Participants: Data from the Commonwealth Fund 2001 Quality of Care telephone survey. Analysis focused on the subsample of 6,066 adults who live in the continental United States and who reported having a regular provider or a usual source of care (n = 4,762). Measurements and Results: We analyzed patients’ responses about perceptions of disrespect, unfair treatment because of race and language, and the belief that he/she would have received better treatment if he/she belonged to a different race. We compared these perceptions of mistreatment with provider and staff racial concordance, controlling for sociodemographic variables. Contrary to our hypothesis, Hispanics were more likely to report being treated with disrespect if in a concordant relationship with their provider than if in a nonconcordant one (odds ratio [OR] 2.42, P < .01). Asians were less likely to report being treated unfairly because of race if in racially concordant relationships with providers than if in nonconcordant ones (P < .05). Hispanics were also less likely to perceive unfair treatment because of language when in concordant relationships with staff as compared to nonconcordant relationships with staff (P < .05). Conclusions: Patients’ perceptions of health care relationships may partially depend on racial concordance with providers and staff. The nature of the association between racial concordance and perceived disrespect varies by racial group, indicating that other race-specific factors may also need to be examined.

Methods: The study sample consisted of 12 non-academic primary care physicians and 100 patients from a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital in Houston, Texas. Patient literacy level was measured on a 1-4 scale using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). Physicians rated each patient's literacy level on a corresponding scale. Chi-square was used to test for association of patient race/ethnicity and gender with: (1) patient REALM level and (2) discrepancy between patient REALM level and physician rating of patient literacy level. Results: Patient REALM level was not statistically significantly associated with patient race/ethnicity or gender. Physicians overestimated the REALM level for 54% of African American, 11% of white non-Hispanic, and 36% of other race/ethnicity patients (p<.01). Conclusion: Physicians commonly overestimate patients' literacy levels, and this apparently occurs more often with minority patients, and particularly with African Americans, than with white non-Hispanic patients. This discordance in estimation of patient's literacy level may be a source of disparities in health care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {According to the American Cancer Society, African American men have a higher incidence of and mortality rate from prostate cancer than any other race. Early detection through screening improves prostate cancer survival rates. Yet compared to that of Caucasians, the prostate cancer screening rate is low among African Americans. To address these disparities, the Florida Department of Health (FLDOH) held statewide prostate screenings in selected cities, targeting African American men. The half-day program, held on a Saturday, included (1) a panel discussion by a urologist, a faculty member from a local university who specializes in prostate research, and a prostate cancer survivor; (2) prostate- specific antigen screenings; and (3) the NEC, which is the focus of this GEM. Participants were 21 African American men ranging in age from 37 to 78, most of whom (71%) had professional occupations. A prostate screening program in a faith based setting offers good potential for providing dietary guidance for prostate health to African American men.

Abstract = {A unique race relations course taught at the University of North Florida during the 1970s provided life-changing experiences for Black and White students. Taught by a licensed clinical psychologist, course requirements included small group discussions of racial issues, individual interactions of students and the instructor, readings about racial issues, personal journals about associated experiences, a visit to a historically Black college, and a week-long live-in stay in the home of the other race. The interactive nature of the course compelled students to explore and define personal racial convictions in significant depth. In addition to helping class members learn about the other race, the experience facilitated personal development and self-discovery. In retrospective studies, conducted 20 yrs later, former students described the course as having life-long, life-changing impacts and recommended that similar courses be taught today.

Abstract = {Objectives: To compare the incidence of nonfatal traumatic brain injury (TBI) hospitalization among American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) with that of other race groups and to assess alcohol and protective equipment (PE) use among those who sustained TBI related to a motor vehicle (MV) incident. Methods: Data were obtained from 13 states funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct TBI surveillance from 1997 to 1999. Rates by race and by cause were calculated for the 13 states combined. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels and PE use were compared between AI/AN and "other" races in a subgroup of these states. Results: Although not significantly different, AI/AN had the highest overall age-adjusted TBI hospitalization rate (71.5 per 100,000). Rates were significantly higher among AI/AN than among whites for ages 20 to 44 years (78.5 per 100,000 vs 54.7 per 100,000, P < .0001). MV incidents were the leading cause of TBI (40.1% of cases) among AI/AN, and AI/AN injured in MV incidents had higher BAC levels (65.7% ≥ 0.08 g/dL vs 31.6% ≥ 0.08 g/dL, P < .0001) and lower PE use (22.0% vs 40.4%, P < .0001) than the "other" race group. Conclusion: AI/AN have high rates of TBI hospitalization compared with other races. High BAC levels and low use of PE in MV incidents appear to be associated with the higher rates in this population.

Abstract = {There has been growing interest in the protective health benefits of multivitamin use (MVU). Relatively little research has investigated the factors associated with MVU among adults across a broad age range, particularly among lower-income, racially/ethnically diverse adults. In light of standing MVU recommendations and documented health benefits for certain groups, as well as ongoing studies evaluating the potential health benefits of multivitamins, vitamin D, and calcium, research among this understudied population is warranted. The aims of this paper were to assess the association between MVU and (1) sociodemographic, (2) preventive/health, and (3) patient/provider factors among a racially and ethnically diverse adult sample of over 1,500 low-income housing residents living in Boston, Massachusetts (USA). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were the primary analytic strategy for investigating these associations. In multivariable analyses, sociodemographic factors (female gender, older age, and White or Other race/ethnicity) were significantly associated with regular MVU (p ≤ .05). Preventive/health variables (health status, physical activity, and body mass index) and characteristics of patient/provider relationships (having a regular provider, last provider visit, decision-autonomy, and quality of relationship) were not significantly associated with MVU. While more evidence is needed to understand the benefits of MVU, future studies should address low use of MVU among lower-income, multi-ethnic populations, particularly in light of health disparities.

Abstract = {Background: Steps/day guidelines for children aged 12 years and under are 12,000 to 16,000. There are limited reports in the literature on how many steps/day adolescents need to meet the 60-minutes/day moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recommendation. This study aimed to determine the steps/day that correctly classifies adolescents as meeting the 60-minute recommendation using objective measures. Methods: This analysis used data from 40 overweight (BMI M = 31.5, SD = 5.3) adolescents enrolled between 2005 and 2006 in a study to lose weight. Participants were aged 11 to 16 years (M = 13.2, SD = 1.2), 70.0% girls, and 52.6% non-Hispanic white, 23.7% Hispanic, and 23.7% other race/ethnicity. Participants wore an Actigraph accelerometer for up to 7 days that measured accelerations and step counts simultaneously. The age-adjusted Freedson equation was used to estimate physical activity–intensity minutes. Two criteria were used to define MVPA (3/6 and 4/7 METs). Analyses were conducted between 2008 and 2009. Results: Based on accelerometer data, approximately 48% and 10% of adolescents met the MVPA recommendation depending on the MVPA criteria. Adolescents who met phyiscial activity recommendation had higher MVPA min/day (p < 0.001) and higher step counts (p < 0.001), after adjusting for gender, age, and ethnicity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses found that 9930 steps produced 0.84 sensitivity and 0.81 specificity (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.89) and 11,714 steps produced 0.75 and 0.81 specificity (AUC = 0.94) for meeting the recommendation using the 3/6 and 4/7 criteria, respectively. Conclusions: Depending on the MVPA criteria used, these data suggest that overweight adolescents are likely to meet national MVPA recommendations if they accumulate between 10,000 and 11,700 steps per day.

Abstract = {This study examines the association between using and sharing high dead-space syringes (HDSSs)—which retain over 1000 times more blood after rinsing than low dead-space syringes (LDSSs)—and prevalent HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among injecting drug users (IDUs). A sample of 851 out-of treatment IDUs was recruited in Raleigh–Durham, North Carolina, between 2003 and 2005. Participants were tested for HIV and HCV antibodies. Demographic, drug use, and injection practice data were collected via interviews. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Participants had a mean age of 40 years and 74% are male, 63% are African American, 29% are non-Hispanic white, and 8% are of other race/ethnicity. Overall, 42% of participants had ever used an HDSS and 12% had shared one. HIV prevalence was 5% among IDUs who had never used an HDSS compared with 16% among IDUs who had shared one. The HIV model used a propensity score approach to adjust for differences between IDUs who had used an HDSS and those who had never used one. The HCV models included all potential confounders as covariates. A history of sharing HDSSs was associated with prevalent HIV (odds ratio = 2.50; 95% confidence interval = 1.01, 6.15). Use and sharing of HDSSs were also associated with increased odds of HCV infection. Prospective studies are needed to determine if sharing HDSSs is associated with increased HIV and HCV incidence among IDUs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: The goals were to examine disagreement in primary care provider and parent reports of mental health counseling and to determine whether disagreement was associated with provider, parent, youth, and visit characteristics. Methods: Directly after 749 visits to 54 pediatric primary care providers in 16 practices, the parents of youths 5 to 16 years of age and the providers independently reported whether mental health counseling was provided. The parent also reported child mental health symptoms, the reason for the visit, and his or her attitudes about receiving treatment for child mental health problems in primary care. The provider reported confidence in his or her mental health treatment skills, burden and beliefs associated with treating mental health problems, and the accessibility of mental health specialists. Results: Providers reported delivering counseling during 31.9% of visits (n = 239), whereas parents reported receiving counseling during only 11.4% of visits (n = 86). Parents did not report receiving counseling during 74.8% of the visits in which the provider reported delivering counseling; this was more common when the parent was seeking help for a mental health problem, when the provider reported greater burden associated with treating mental health problems, and when the youth had more mental health symptoms or was of other race/Hispanic. Provider report of counseling in the absence of parent report of counseling was less common when the provider had greater access to mental health specialists. Conclusions: Parents often did not report that the counseling delivered in primary care was mental health treatment. Counseling that is not perceived as mental health treatment may fail to meet parent expectations for care or fail to help parents identify mental health problems.

Abstract = {This exploratory investigation assessed the utility of generalizability analyses for investigating race of coder and race of family member ('target') as contributors to bias in observer ratings of family interaction processes. Thirty behavioral scales were rated on three occasions during an initial 5-week (100-hour) training period. African-American and European-American coders observed videotaped interactions occurring in one African-American and one European-American parent-child dyad. For each scale, levels of rater bias and rater agreement were examined over time. Although most scales showed decreasing levels of bias with training (as expected), some did not. For scales showing a main effect for coder race, European-American coders rated targets more favorably than did African-American coders. For scales susceptible to coder race by target race interactions, coders tended to favor other race rather than same-race targets. Suggestions for applying the generalizability approach in future family interaction research are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Efforts to increase HIV case identification through routine, voluntary HIV testing are hindered by high refusal rates. Our objective was to identify patients most likely to refuse routine HIV testing. We developed a new HIV testing program at four Massachusetts urgent care centers. Patients were asked if they were interested in routine HIV testing. We performed analyses to assess differences in characteristics between those who refused testing and those who accepted it. Data were available for 9129/10,354 (88%) patients offered routine HIV testing from January to December 2002. Of these 9129 patients, 67% refused testing. In the crude analysis, HIV test refusal was associated with female gender, white race, older age, and higher educational level. In multivariate analysis, non-English-speaking patients who were Hispanic, Haitian, and other race were more likely to refuse testing than their English-speaking counterparts. Among all patients, "not at risk" and "already tested" were the most common reasons for test refusal. Two thirds of patients refused routine HIV testing when it was offered in a statewide urgent care-based program. If routine HIV testing programs are to be successful, strategies must be developed to increase HIV test acceptance among patients most likely to refrain from testing.

Observations were made in the morning and afternoon. Utilizing social deprivation theory, the authors hypothesized that women and minorities would be more likely than others to wash their hands. The data provide empirical support for this proposition. Further, having an observer present made it more likely that a person would wash his or her hands.

Abstract = {This study examines the attitudes of female officers towards their colleagues and work utilizing data from a survey of women in policing in Texas. It focuses on minority and majority officers' perceptions of other officers, sexual and racial discrimination, and stress. The findings suggest the presence of several interesting similarities and differences between minority and majority female officers. There is little evidence that female officers do not feel accepted or feel they are treated unfairly on the job. None of the respondents perceived gender discrimination within the workplace. Black and white officers perceived sexual teasing and job stress as fairly common; this was not the case with respect to Latina officers. That is, Latina officers were more likely to prefer male partners than other race/ethnic groups while black officers were more likely to perceive racial discrimination. It is held that the findings with respect to Latina officers may be associated with cultural realities which affect gender-based perceptions. The implications of these findings for future research are also presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Without quantitative data to confirm or refute assertions made from qualitative data, it is hard to judge the potential impact of intervention approaches to reduce individuals and sub-populations’ risk of HIV infection. In contrast to what may be common perception and some researchers assertions about the role of racial stereotypes and their effect on sexual risk taking, the quantitative evidence presented here suggests that Asian Pacific Islander (API) men who have sex with men (MSM) are at no particularly higher risk for unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) with White partners. Furthermore, API MSM appear to be able to use condoms with White and other race partners at rates similar to other groups of MSM. We concur that in-depth research is needed. Qualitative and quantitative investigations must work together to enhance our ability to clearly define the factors that contribute to HIV risk taking. More robust inquiries, including both methodological approaches, are needed to develop innovative HIV prevention interventions that address the complex underlying factors contributing to HIV risk taking among API MSM.

Abstract = {Context: Since deinstitutionalization, most persons with severe mental illness (SMI) now live in the community, where they are at great risk for crime victimization. Objectives: To determine the prevalence and incidence of crime victimization among persons with SMI by sex, race/ethnicity, and age, and to compare rates with general population data (the National Crime Victimization Survey), controlling for income and demographic differences between the samples. Design: Epidemiologic study of persons in treatment. Independent master's-level clinical research interviewers administered the National Crime Victimization Survey to randomly selected patients sampled from 16 randomly selected mental health agencies. Setting: Sixteen agencies providing outpatient, day, and residential treatment to persons with SMI in Chicago, Ill. Participants: Randomly selected, stratified sample of 936 patients aged 18 or older (483 men, 453 women) who were African American (n = 329), non-Hispanic white (n = 321), Hispanic (n = 270), or other race/ethnicity (n = 22). The comparison group comprised 32449 participants in the National Crime Victimization Survey. Main Outcome Measure: National Crime Victimization Survey, developed by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Results: More than one quarter of persons with SMI had been victims of a violent crime in the past year, a rate more than 11 times higher than the general population rates even after controlling for demographic differences between the 2 samples (P<.001). The annual incidence of violent crime in the SMI sample (168.2 incidents per 1000 persons) is more than 4 times higher than the general population rates (39.9 incidents per 1000 persons) (P<.001). Depending on the type of violent crime (rape/sexual assault, robbery, assault, and their subcategories), prevalence was 6 to 23 times greater among persons with SMI than among the general population. Conclusions: Crime victimization is a major public health problem among persons with SMI who are treated in the community. We recommend directions for future research, propose modifications in public policy, and suggest how the mental health system can respond to reduce victimization and its consequences.

Abstract = {Assessed the prevalence of and factors associated with 'barebacking' as a sociocultural phenomenon in a sample of HIV-positive and -negative men who have sex with men (MSM), and assessed the reasons for barebacking and venues for meeting partners. Barebacking, defined as 'intentional anal sex without a condom with someone other than a primary partner', was assessed among men who had heard of the term. Participants were recruited outside multiple venues and interviewed later at community locations. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression were used for analysis. The sample (n=554; aged 18-67 yrs) MSM were African-American (28%), Latino (27%), White (31%) and other race/ethnicity (14%); 35% reported being HIV-positive. 70% of the men had heard of barebacking. Among men aware of the term, 14% had barebacked in the past 2 yrs (22% of HIV-positive versus 10% of HIV-negative men); 10% of the full sample did so. The prevalence of barebacking did not differ by race/ethnicity or sexual orientation identification. Men tended to report bareback partners who had the same HIV serostatus; however, a sizeable proportion of men had partners of different or unknown serostatus. Increased physical stimulation and emotional connectedness were the primary reasons for barebacking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The FDA approved hydroxyurea for use in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) in 1998. In 2002, the NHLBI published recommendations for the use of hydroxyurea in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate providers' awareness of the NHLBI recommendations regarding hydroxyurea prescribing, whether these recommendations have changed providers' practices and how these providers prescribed hydroxyurea. We chose to survey a select group of providers of care to adults with SCD, members of the Sickle Cell Adult Provider Network. The response rate was 47%. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported they had read the NHLBI recommendations on hydroxyurea use, and 76% of respondents agreed with the NHLBI recommendations. Only 45% of respondents to this survey reported that they prescribe hydroxyurea to every eligible patient. Black respondents reported a higher percentage of their eligible patients being on hydroxyurea than white respondents. Seventy-seven percent of respondents thought that hydroxyurea was effective or very effective in patients with SCD. Ninety-four percent of black versus 73% of white versus 40% of other race respondents thought that hydroxyurea was effective or very effective in SCD patients (p = 0.006). The results of this survey suggest that lack of awareness, agreement and belief in the benefits of hydroxyurea contributes to providers underprescribing hydroxyurea.

Abstract = {Examines the temporal association between body image and depressive symptoms in an ethnically diverse sample of male and female adolescents. It was anticipated that body image would have a stronger impact on the depressive symptoms of girls than of boys and that African Americans would be less likely than the other groups to exhibit increased depressive symptomatology as a function of a change toward a more negative body image. Body image, depressive symptoms, and self esteem were each assessed at 2 points in time, approximately 13 mo apart. 877 African American, Asian American, White, Hispanic, or other ethnicity 12–17 yr olds were interviewed during Time 1, and 675 adolescents were reinterviewed for Time 2. Findings showed that girls were more influenced by change in body image than boys, but our assumption that African American girls would be least affected by body image changes was strongly disconfirmed. When the body image of African American teens declines, they experience a significant increase in psychological distress, and this increase is steeper than that observed in girls from other race/ethnicity groups.

Design & Setting: A retrospective review of 234 medical records from an emergency department sexual assault program. Sample: Women aged 14 to 29 years. Fifty percent of the sample was African American, 48% was White, and 2% was either Asian or an "other" race. Main Outcome Measures: Genital injury was described by injury prevalence, frequency, and anatomical locations of injuries. Results: Overall genital injury prevalence was 62.8%. Younger age was not significantly associated with the presence or absence of genital injury. However, younger age was significantly associated with an increased number of genital injuries overall and to the thighs, labia minora, periurethral area, fossa navicularis, and vagina. Conclusion: These findings support the need for further research to determine if the current care provided to rape survivors is age appropriate.

Abstract = {Three experiments compared face recognition performance following global and local Navon processing and verbalisation, and explored the extent to which the effects of these tasks were influenced by encoding processes. Experiment 1 used the Navon letter task at encoding, whereas Experiments 2 and 3 used personality and physical feature judgements to induce holistic and featural encoding. Accuracy and response latencies were measured for stimuli of own- and other-race faces. Results showed that both the Navon and verbal overshadowing effects were not influenced by the Navon encoding task; however, the judgement task used in Experiments 2 and 3 eliminated all impairment caused by local processing but not by providing a verbal description. These results are discussed with regards to the holistic and featural explanations of Navon processing and verbalisation effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: In 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new recommendations for routine HIV testing. Among these were recommendations that emergency departments (EDs) offer routine opt-out HIV screening to their patients. We established a screening program implementing these recommendations at an urban university hospital ED in Washington, DC. We report the results of this program. Methods: During a 3-month period, ED patients being treated for a wide range of conditions were approached by trained HIV screeners and offered point-of-care rapid HIV testing. Patients with positive results were referred to hospital or community resources for confirmatory testing and treatment. Results: During the program period, 14,986 patients were treated in the ED and 4151 (27.6%) were offered HIV screening. The mean patient age was 37.5 years; 48.5% were black, 39.0% were non-Hispanic white, 4.1% were Hispanic, 1.7% were Asian, and 6.7% responded as being other race. A total of 56.1% were female, and most lived within the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Of the patients offered HIV screening, 2476 (59.7%) accepted the test. Of the 26 patients with a preliminary positive screen, 13 were lost to follow-up, 9 were confirmed positive by Western blot, and 4 were confirmed negative by Western blot. Eight of the 9 patients with confirmed HIV infection were successfully linked to follow-up care. Conclusions: The implementation of the CDC recommendations establishing routine opt-out HIV screening programs in EDs is feasible. Further efforts to establish routine ED HIV testing are therefore warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Examined whether categorization as an other-race face is sufficient to produce poorer cross-racial identification. A computerized program (Mac-a-Mug Pro®) for face composition was used to create pairs of target and distractor faces that differed only in skin tone. The 6 target faces were rated on honesty and aggressiveness by 72 university students, with just 1 "Black" and 1 "White" face viewed by each student. One week later, they attempted to identify these faces in 4 lineups: 2 with target-present and two with target-absent. The order of presentation of targets, lineups, and faces within lineups was varied. Results show that own-race identification was slightly better than cross-racial identification. There was no significant difference in the confidence of responses to own- vs other-race faces. These results indicate that neither morphological variation nor differential confidence is necessary for a cross-racial identification effect.

Abstract = {Examined whether facial averageness and symmetry are attractive in non-Western cultures. Increasing the averageness of individual faces, by warping those faces towards an averaged composite of the same race and sex, increased the attractiveness of both Chinese (Exp 1) and Japanese (Exp 2) faces, for Chinese and Japanese participants, respectively. Decreasing averageness by moving the faces away from an average shape decreased attractiveness. The authors also manipulated the symmetry of Japanese faces by blending each original face with its mirror image to create perfectly symmetric versions. Japanese raters preferred the perfectly symmetric versions to the original faces (Exp 2). These findings show that preferences for facial averageness and symmetry are not restricted to Western cultures, consistent with the view that they are biologically based. Interestingly, it made little difference whether averageness was manipulated by using own-race or other-race averaged composites and there was no preference for own-race averaged composites over other-race or mixed-race composites (Exp 1). We discuss the implications of these results for understanding what makes average faces attractive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

A series of upright faces were presented in a study phase, followed by a test phase where Ss indicated whether inverted and upright faces were studied or novel. An inversion effect was reflected in accuracy measures and in greater lateral N2 amplitude to inverted faces, suggesting that structural encoding is harder for inverted faces. An own-race advantage was found, which may reflect the use of configural encoding for the more frequently experienced own-race faces, and feature-based encoding for the less familiar other-race faces. The midline N2 was larger to configurally encoded faces, possibly suggesting configural encoding involves more complex processing than feature-based encoding. An N400-like component was sensitive to feature manipulations, with greater amplitude to other-race than own-race faces and to inverted than upright faces. The late positive complex was sensitive to configural manipulation with larger amplitude to other-race than own-race faces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The order of authorship was incorrectly reported and should read: G. Rhodes, S. Tan, and S. Brake and K. Taylor. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in PA, Vol 77:7186.) The effect of inversion on recognition of "own race" (high expertise) and "other race" (low expertise) faces was compared in 2 experiments involving 100 Chinese and European high school and university students. In Exp 1, there was a larger inversion effect in reaction time (RT) for recognition of own-race faces than other-race faces, for both European and Chinese Ss. In Exp 2, a larger own-race inversion effect was found for recognition accuracy, when test face pairs were randomly selected, but not when they were matched on isolated features. Results are largely consistent with the hypothesis of R. Diamond and S. Carey (see record [rid]1986-21075-001[/rid]) that expertise is associated with greater use of configural information in faces.

Common activities were assessed by questionnaire initially on 656 Ss, 50.5% of whom were female, from 21 elementary schools. Girls more often reported sedentary activities overall. Weighted least squares analyses showed boys consistently reported more vigorous activities than girls. African-American (AA) girls reported fewer vigorous activities than Caucasian or other race girls. Sedentary activities were more frequently reported with increasing age. The youngest AA and Caucasian boys reported similar activity patterns. However, boys from other races reported more intense activities until 6th and 7th grades when AA boys began reporting more sedentary activities than Caucasians or other races. During 6th–8th grades, girls with more advanced pubertal status reported more sedentary activities than girls who were less developed. For high school girls, race was a marginally significant predictor of activity status. Neither race nor pubertal status were significant factors in activities chosen by middle school boys. However, for male high school students, Caucasians were more likely than AAs to report vigorous activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reviews the available literature on alcohol and drug use/abuse and psychopathology as predictors of violent behavior (VB) and criminally violent acts. The preponderance of the research evidence supports the conclusion that abuse of certain types of illicit drugs, separately from the abuse of alcohol, predisposes to subsequent VB. The relationship of cocaine/crack to violent crime has been established more clearly for users of crack in inner city areas than it has for users of other forms of cocaine. In regard to race/ethnic or SES factors, the most clearly established is a higher proportion of young Black males, compared to other race/ethnic groups, actively involved in dealing cocaine/crack in inner city poverty areas. As for gender differences, alcohol abuse as a predictor to and a precipitant of VB, is more clearly established for males than for females. Drug abuse, as distinct from alcohol abuse, has been found to predict subsequent VB, for both sexes. The combination of substance use and psychopathology appears more likely to predict later VB in females. Psychopathology and mental health problems are less likely to predict occurrence of either VB or criminality in the future than are either alcohol abuse or drug abuse.

Abstract = {Study Objective: To examine the association between neighbourhood income inequality and depression, both overall and among those with different levels of income, in the post-disaster context. Design: A representative cross sectional random digit dial telephone survey was conducted. Setting: New York City (NYC) six months after September 11, 2001. Participants: 1570 respondents were interviewed, of whom 1355 provided residence information permitting their inclusion in this analysis. Past six month depression was assessed using a lay administered instrument consistent with DSM-IV criteria. Income inequality was measured with the Gini coefficient. Main results: The sample was demographically representative of NYC (56.2% female, 35.7% white, 6.3% Asian 24.2% African American, 29.7% Hispanic, and 4.2% other race or ethnicity) and the prevalence of past six month depression was 12.4%. In a final adjusted model, neighbourhood level income inequality was positively associated with depression but this association was not significant (β = 7.58, p = 0.1). However, among those with low individual income (< $20,000) there was a strong significant association between income inequality and depression (β = 35.02, p < 0.01), while there was no association among those with higher income. Conclusions: In the post-disaster context, neighbourhood level income inequality was associated with depression among persons with lower income; this group may be more socially or economically marginalized and dependent on local resources. Future research should examine potential mechanisms through which income inequality and other features of the social context may affect mental health in the post-disaster context.

Abstract = {Objective: In this study, we sought to examine the prevalence, correlates, and consequences associated with simultaneous polydrug use and concurrent polydrug use of alcohol and prescription drugs. For purposes of this investigation, simultaneous polydrug use referred to the co-ingestion of different drugs at the same time, and concurrent polydrug use referred to the use of different drugs on separate occasions within the past 12 months. Method: Undergraduate students attending a large public midwestern university in the United States were randomly selected to self-administer a Web survey. The sample consisted of 4,580 undergraduate students, with a mean (SD) age of 19.9 (2.0) years; the sample consisted of 50% women, and the racial breakdown was 65% white, 13% Asian, 7% black, 5% Hispanic, and 10% other race/ethnicity. The survey assessed simultaneous polydrug use and concurrent polydrug use of alcohol and four classes of prescription drugs: (1) pain medication, (2) stimulant medication, (3) sedative medication, and (4) sleeping medication. Results: The 12-month prevalence for polydrug use involving alcohol and abusable prescription drugs was 12.1% (including 6.9% simultaneous polydrug use). The majority of polydrug use involving alcohol and each class of prescription drugs was simultaneous polydrug use, with the exception of sleeping medication. Simultaneous polydrug use was more prevalent among undergraduate students who were male, were white, and reported early initiation of alcohol use. Simultaneous polydrug use was associated with more alcohol-related and other drug use-related problems than concurrent polydrug use. Conclusions: Based on the high prevalence and increased risk for consequences associated with simultaneous polydrug use of alcohol and prescription drugs, collegiate prevention efforts aimed at reducing substance abuse should clearly focus on co-ingestion of alcohol and prescription drugs.

Research has shown that females attach more importance to certain prosocial values than males do in late adolescence but has not considered whether this gender difference is evident across stages of adolescence and whether it varies by race. We examine values that focus on doing things for others, using data from a nationwide survey of 12- to 17-year-olds. We find that girls place more importance on these prosocial values than boys at younger ages. However, we also find important patterns in this gender difference across racial groups as well as across age. White boys appear to attach less importance to prosocial values than other race and gender groups. Furthermore, the gender gap in prosocial values is larger at older ages, with older adolescent boys placing less importance on prosocial values than younger ones.

Abstract = {Investigated differences between 88 African-American (AA) males, 92 AA females, 175 White males, and 157 White females who moved from Grade 6 in a K–6 school to Grade 7 in a junior high school. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used on 71 dependent variables, with race and sex serving as independent variables. Social class and age were controlled. On most variables there were no significant racial differences in the change to Grade 7. Where there were significant differences, they indicated AA boys differed from the other race/gender groups. These differences pointed to an earlier adoption of behaviors and attitudes consistent with the stereotype of adolescence. AA boys showed greater indications of conflict, earlier entry to heterosexual relationships, greater expectations from parents and peers that they would date earlier, and greater indications of gender intensification.

Abstract = {Background: Due to changing cultural norms, Latinas of childbearing age residing in the U.S. may be at increasing risk of drinking harmful levels of alcohol during pregnancy, and may also be unaware of the risks for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders associated with this behavior. We assessed the prevalence of alcohol consumption in a sample of low-income pregnant Latinas and examined risk factors for alcohol use in the periconceptional period. Methods: As part of a larger intervention trial, a cross-sectional in-home interview study was conducted among a sample of 100 pregnant low-income Latinas receiving services from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in San Diego County, California. Results: Fifty-seven percent of respondents indicated they were either life-time abstainers or had not consumed any alcohol in the periconceptional period. Forty-three percent reported some alcohol use in the three months prior to recognition of the current pregnancy, and 20% reported at least one binge episode of four or more standard drinks during that time frame. Five percent reported drinking seven or more drinks per week, and 8% continued drinking alcohol after recognition of pregnancy. Significant predictors of any alcohol use in the periconceptional period included English language/higher level of acculturation, younger maternal age, lower parity, higher level of education, younger age at first drink, and having ever smoked. Women who were aware of alcohol warning messages and/or had more knowledge of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) were significantly more likely to have consumed alcohol in the periconceptional period. Frequency of periconceptional use of alcohol did not differ between women who planned or did not plan the pregnancy. Conclusion: The prevalence and pattern of early pregnancy alcohol consumption in this sample of Latinas is similar to patterns noted in other race/ethnic groups in the U.S. Level of knowledge about FAS and awareness of warning messages was not protective for early pregnancy alcohol consumption, suggesting that specific knowledge was insufficient to prevent exposure or that other factors reinforce maintenance of alcohol consumption in early pregnancy. Selective interventions in low-income Latinas are warranted, and should be focused on women of reproductive age who are binge or frequent drinkers and who are at risk of becoming pregnant.

Abstract = {Reviews past and current measures of stereotyping and examines the efficacy of the free-response format of the Adjective Generation Technique. Questionnaires from 81 European-American and 63 African-American college students were used to measure in-group bias effect, intergroup anxiety and favorability, the role of power in intergroup knowledge, and the richness of in- and out-group descriptions. Results show that each group's, conception of the other differed from its own-group conception. The in-group bias effect for favorability and anxiety values was confirmed for both groups, supporting the continued existence of bias against other race out-groups. Overall, European Americans were described less favorably, disaffirming the "Black self-hatred" notion and suggesting low levels of European-American self-esteem. More terms were used to describe African Americans, indicating that a power differential may create a stronger race identity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the racial preferences and reasons in liking and disliking classmates in 264 White and Asian boys and girls, aged 8–10 yrs, in 2 studies conducted in the UK. In study 1, Ss were interviewed individually and shown photographs of their classmates. Ss were asked to nominate classmates he or she "liked most" and "liked least." All Ss selected more own-race than other-race classmates as "liked most" choices. For "liked least" choices, White boys and girls selected more other-race classmates, Asian boys more own-race classmates; Asian girls did not differ in own- and other-race choices. Study 2 further investigated the reasons behind the study 1 choices. The most common reasons for liking and disliking their classmates rested respectively on the latter's being cooperative and being bullies. Developing cooperative group work methods may enhance interracial liking and reduce racial prejudice among children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Three experiments explored the role of perceptual expertise in mediating the finding (termed verbal overshadowing) that describing a face can impair later recognition. In Experiment 1, verbalization impaired White participants' recognition of White faces (expert domain) but not African American faces (novice domain). In Experiment 2, judges attempted to identify targets on the basis of the verbal descriptions generated in Experiment 1. Experiment 2 revealed a significant relationship between verbalization participants' recognition performance and yoked judges' identification performance for other-race but not own-race faces, suggesting that other-race recognition may involve a unique reliance on "verbalizable" information. In Experiment 3, the interaction between verbalization and race of face was replicated with upright faces but was attenuated with inverted recognition arrays (a manipulation that reduces the influence of configural information). Collectively, these findings suggest that verbalization may disrupt the nonreportable configural processes associated with recognizing stimuli with which one is an expert.

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Social and demographic predictors of preschoolers’ bedtime routines" by Lauren Hale, Lawrence M. Berger, Monique K. LeBourgeois and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn (Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 2009[Oct], Vol 30[5], 394-402). In this article, three values of Table 3 underneath the column of "OLS Hour of Bedtime" were incorrect.The correct OLS Hour of Bedtime for Mother is Hispanic (vs. white), Mother is black (vs. white), and Mother is of other race (vs. white) should read: .247***, .135**, and .411***, respectively, whereas *p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001. This error has been noted in the online version of the article, which is available at www.jdbp.org. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2009-18874-004[/rid]). Objective: To examine the associations of child and family sociodemographic characteristics with preschooler bedtime routines. Method: We use parent-report data of 3217 3-year-old children (48% black, 26% Hispanic, and 22% white) from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine whether child and family characteristics are associated with the presence, time, and consistency of bedtime routines. Results: More than 80% of sample children have a bedtime yet only two thirds follow it. After extensive controls for maternal education, family structure, and other household characteristics, black and Hispanic children have later bedtimes than white children and reduced odds of using regular bedtimes (by 22% and 29%, respectively) and using bedtime routines (by 47% and 33%, respectively). Low maternal education, increased household size, and poverty are associated with decreased use of parent-child interactive and hygiene-related bedtime routines. Conclusion: Children from disadvantaged households are less likely to have consistent bedtime routines than their more advantaged counterparts. This may contribute to later disparities in sleep quality, duration and timing, factors known to be associated with adverse behavioral, cognitive, and health outcomes.

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the extent to which socioeconomic and racial/ethnic differences in cancer screening discussion between a patient and his/her primary care physician are due to "within-physician" differences (the fact that patients were treated differently by the same physicians) versus "between-physician" differences (that they were treated by a different group of physicians). Data Sources: We use data from the baseline patient and physician surveys of two community trials from the Communication in Medical Care (CMC) research series. The two studies combined provide an analysis sample of 5,978 patients ages 50-80 nested within 191 primary care physicians who practiced throughout Southern California. Study Design: Our main outcomes of interest are whether the physician has ever talked to the patient about fecal occult blood test (FOBT; for colorectal cancer screening), mammogram (for breast cancer screening, female patients only) and the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA, male patients only). We consider five racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian, and other race/ethnicity. We measure socioeconomic status by both income and education. For each type of cancer screening discussion, we first estimate a probit model that includes patient characteristics as the only covariates to assess the overall differences. We then add physician fixed effects to derive estimates of "within-" versus "between-" physician differences. Principal Findings: There was a strong education gradient in the discussion of all three types of cancer screening and most of the education differences arose within physicians. Disparities by income were less consistent across different screening methods, but seemed to have arisen mainly because of "between-physician" differences. Asians were much less likely, compared with whites, to have received discussion about FOBT and PSA and these differences were mainly "within-physician" differences. Black female patients, however, were much more likely, compared with whites treated by the same physicians, to have discussed mammogram with their physicians. Conclusions: Differences in cancer screening discussion along the different dimensions of patient SES may have arisen because of very different mechanisms and therefore call for a combination of interventions. Physicians need to be aware of the persistent disparities by patient education in clinical communication regarding cancer screening and tailor their efforts to the needs of low-education patients. Quality-improvement efforts targeted at physicians practicing in low-income communities may also be effective in addressing disparities in cancer screening communication by patient income.

Abstract = {Background: Constructing and evaluating item pools that measure a single domain of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is one of the fundamental Objectives of the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement and Information System (PROMIS) project. The initial focus of PROMIS is on five HRQOL domains: physical function (PF), fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and social/role participation. Analysis of related, available data can inform construction of these new banks. Objective: We sought to inform the building of the PROMIS physical function item bank by evaluating physical functioning items administered to participants in the Medical Outcomes Study. Research Design: Secondary analyses of physical functioning items administered at baseline (Fall, 1986) to 3,223 individuals in the Medical Outcomes Study. Subjects: The mean age was 54; 15 percent had less than a high school education, 30 percent had a high school education, 27 percent had some but less than 4 years of college, and 28 percent had 4 or more years of college. Sixty-one percent were female; 80 percent were non-Hispanic white, 14 percent non-Hispanic black, 3 percent Hispanic, 1 percent Asian, and 2 percent other race/ethnicity. Measures: Fifteen physical functioning items were selected for analysis including the 10 SF-36 physical functioning items, an item assessing limitations in everyday physical activities because of health problems, an item measuring satisfaction with physical ability, and three mobility items. Results: Cronbach's alpha was 0.94 for the 15-item scale and item-total correlations ranged from 0.51 (limited in bathing or dressing) to 0.80 (limited walking several blocks). A one-factor confirmatory categorical model fit the data well according to practical fit indices (comparative fit index = 0.95), but the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation was 0.12. Estimated factor loadings were all large (0.72 to 0.96) and statistically significant. We fitted the graded response model with freely estimated and fixed slope estimates to compare 2-PL and 1-PL models. The difference between these two goodness of fit statistics for the two models was statistically significant: χ²(df = 14) = 772.9, p < .001. Slope estimates for some of the items in the 2-PL model varied from the 1-PL common slope to a noteworthy extent (e.g., items 2, 5, 7, 8 and 9). Category threshold estimates were generally similar for the two models. Threshold estimates for the 2-PL model ranged from 2.90 (item 14: between no, never and yes, occasionally in bed or in a chair most or all of the day because of health) to 1.55 (item 12: between very satisfied and completely satisfied with physical ability to do what you want to do). Information peaked at 1.0 theta (information = 33.60) for the 2-PL model. Information was only 7.43 at 0.8 theta (2-PL) and decreased with increasing theta. Conclusions: The 15 physical functioning items provide reasonably good fit to a unidimensional IRT model that provides satisfactory coverage of the lower levels of physical functioning, but does not provide very much information at higher levels of functioning.

Field research indicates that women and racial minorities are more debilitated by solo status than White men. However, laboratory research indicates that men and women are equally debilitated as solos. We noted that laboratory studies introduced solo status during learning, whereas field research examined solo status at performance. Therefore, we predicted that high and low social status group members would be differentially influenced by solo status experienced during testing. In 2 laboratory experiments, men and women and African Americans and Whites (college students) experienced solo status during an oral examination. In Exp 1, White women performed more poorly than White men taking the exam before an opposite-sex (but same-race) audience. In Exp 2, African American women performed more poorly than White women taking the exam before an other race (but same-gender) audience.

Blacks' discontent exceeded Whites' in most instances; Black women more frequently showed significantly higher discontent than other race/gender groups. Also, Blacks' discontent more often exceeded Whites' among persons high in SES than among those low in SES. Gender main effects were almost nonexistent; White women almost never showed more discontent than other race/gender groups, attributable perhaps to White women's greater identification with race than gender and their perception of general but not personal discrimination. As expected, racial differences in discontent tended to be higher during the Nixon-Ford and Reagan US presidential administrations than during the Carter administration.

The goal of the current study was to prospectively examine the influence of age of marijuana initiation on four outcomes: physical health, mental health, illicit drug use other than marijuana, and marijuana-use related consequences at age 18. We controlled for several important predictors of adolescent drug use and its associated consequences, including demographics, social bonding variables, personality variables, and recent use of marijuana. Baseline survey data were collected in 1984 at grade 7 and follow up surveys were conducted at grades 8, 9, 10, and 12 (N = 2079). This initiates-only sample was 47% female, 66% White, 11% African American, 13% Hispanic, 5% Asian, and 5% other race or ethnicity. Findings indicated that age of initiation predicted marijuana consequences and other illicit drug use after controlling for demographic, social, and behavioral factors. However, once frequency of recent marijuana use was included in the models, age of initiation was only associated with other illicit drug use. Both primary and secondary prevention are needed to curb marijuana use and its associated harms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {American Indians and Alaska Natives have had low employment in recent history. Drug users also have low employment due to cycles of drug use and relapse, and the impact of the type of drug abused on levels of functioning. Data from 3 sites of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Cooperative Agreement for Community Based-Outreach/Intervention Research (all Ss aged 18+ yrs) were analyzed to determine the relationship among race/ethnicity, age, and level of educational attainment on employment and unemployment at intake interview and 6-mo follow-up. HIV risk for those employed and unemployed was then assessed. American Indian and Alaska Native drug users were younger, less educated, and less likely to have a paid job at both intake and follow-up than non-Native drug users. Those participants who were unemployed at baseline interview who were American Indian/Alaska Native were less likely to "transition to employment" at 6-mo follow-up than other race/ethnicity groups in the cohort. However, all participants showed low levels of employment at follow-up. Individuals who were employed at baseline and those who transitioned to employment had lower levels of injection drug use and needle sharing than those who were unemployed at both baseline and follow-up.

Perceptual bias (PB) in the observer and face asymmetries (FA) contributed to the asymmetries. There was no PB effect for complex visuospatial stimuli other than human faces. Expertise effects were investigated by examining the judgments of Chinese and Caucasian Ss, for own-race and other-race faces. A PB was found for both Caucasian and Chinese faces. Caucasian Ss showed a PB for own-race faces. Chinese Ss showed a PB for both Chinese and Caucasian faces. There was an FA effect for Caucasian faces, but not for Chinese faces.

Abstract = {Purpose: To understand the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and sexual risk behavior among a community sample of African American adolescents. Methods: African American adolescents (n = 415) who participated in a larger multi-site human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention program provided baseline data on demographics, psychosocial context and depressive symptoms. At six-month follow-up, data were collected regarding sexual activity in the past 90 days. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to determine the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and proportion of condom use while controlling for relevant demographic and contextual factors. Results: The odds that African American adolescents who reported depressive symptoms at baseline would report inconsistent condom use at six-month follow-up was approximately four times greater than that of their peers who did not report depressive symptoms. Older adolescents and females were less likely to use condoms consistently and certain contextual factors, such as less pleasurable expectations about condom use, and living with a partner also heightened HIV/STI risk. Conclusions: Clinicians should assess for depression symptoms in African American adolescent patients as an indicator of future sexual risk. Prevention interventions that address depressed mood could have a significant impact on later HIV/STI sexual risk behaviors. Further research is needed to understand the effect of depressive symptoms on sexual risk among adolescents of other race/ethnicities and to examine the potential cultural forces that affect this relationship.

Abstract = {Little is known about primary care physicians' (PCPs) prescribing of opioids. We describe trends and factors associated with opioid prescribing during PCP visits over the past decade. Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, we found an opioid prescribed in 2,206 (5%) PCP visits from 1992 to 2001. The prevalence of visits where an opioid was prescribed increased from a low of 41 per 1000 visits in 1992-1993 to a peak of 63 per 1000 in 1998-1999 (P < .0001 for trend) and then stabilized (59 per 1000 in 2000-2001). Several factors increased the odds of receiving an opioid: having Medicaid (odds ratio [OR] 2.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82-2.40]) or Medicare (OR 2.00 [95% CI 1.68-2.39]); having a visit between 15 and 35 minutes (OR 1.16 [95% CI 1.05-1.27]); and receiving an NSAID (OR 2.27 [95% CI 2.04-2.53]). Patients of hispanic (OR .67 [95% CI .56-.81]) or other race/ethnicity (OR .68 [95% CI .52-.90]), patients in health maintenance organizations (OR .74 [95% CI .66-.84]), and those living in the northeast (OR .60 [95% CI .51-.69]) or midwest (OR .75 [95% CI .66-.85]) had lower odds of receiving an opioid. Substantial variation exists in opioid prescribing by PCPs. Now that pain management standards are advocated, understanding the dynamics of opioid prescribing is necessary. Perspective: This study describes a decade-long increase in opioid prescribing by U.S. primary care physicians and identifies important geographic-, racial/ethnic-, and insurance-related differences in who receives these medications. Several underlying factors, including regulatory and legal pressures, attitudes and knowledge of opioids, and publicized opioid-related events, may contribute to these differences.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of all primary malignant and nonmalignant brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors on mortality in the USA in terms of years of life lost, an indicator of premature mortality in the population. In this study, US mortality data for the year 2001 from the National Center for Health Statistics and life tables from the US Census Bureau were used. Person-years of potential life lost (PYPLL) and average years of potential life lost (AYPLL) were calculated for all deaths due to brain and CNS tumors as an underlying cause. 16,819 deaths due to brain and CNS tumors occurred in 2001, leading to a total loss of 357,483 person-years of life and an average loss of 21.3 years (AYPLL). Hispanic men and women had an AYPLL of 31.7 and 33.9 years, respectively, a figure substantially higher than other race and ethnicity categories. Malignant tumors led to an AYPLL of 25 years, which was significantly higher than the AYPLL of 19 years due to nonmalignant tumors. The relative impact of tumors arising in the various anatomical sites in the brain and CNS among adults and among children was not similar. The use of population survival indicators, such as PYPLL and AYPLL, will help better understanding of the effect of racial, ethnic, gender and age differences on the mortality due to malignant and nonmalignant brain and CNS tumors. Information on years of life lost, as well as mortality data, will be useful in focusing research priorities and resources in this field. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of selected behaviors related to chronic diseases among women ≥65 years old using the 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. Methods and Results: Seven behaviors were assessed: having a healthy weight, current cigarette smoking status, consumption of at least five fruits or vegetables daily, leisure time physical activity in the the past month, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during the average week, influenza immunization in the past year, and lifetime pneumococcal immunization. With increasing age, women ≥65 years old were more likely to have a healthy weight, to be a nonsmoker, and to consume at least five fruits or vegetables daily and less likely to participate in any leisure time or moderate-to-vigorous physical activities. Women with higher incomes and educational attainment were more likely to engage in most healthful behaviors and to have a healthy weight. However, black non-Hispanic women were less likely than white women or those of other race or ethnicity to engage in most healthful behaviors and to have a healthy weight. Women who rated their health as fair or poor were more likely to receive a pneumococcal immunization, and those who rated their health as excellent were least likely to receive an influenza immunization in the past year. Conclusions: BRFSS data can be used to monitor the prevalence of behaviors related to chronic disease of women aged ≥65 years and to develop programs and polices that promote and reinforce healthful behaviors. These measures have the potential to help reduce morbidity and morality from chronic disease in older women, thereby minimizing the discrepancy between years of healthy life expectancy and life expectancy.

Abstract = {Cross-race recognition (CRR) was examined for White and Black faces using 241 college students from 4 racial groups: 93 Whites, 42 Blacks, 37 Latinos, and 69 Asians. Before viewing the faces, Ss were asked to complete a passage to induce either a pleasant or an unpleasant mood. Each S viewed a set of intermixed Black and White faces under each mood condition. A strong CRR effect was observed between Black and White Ss, such that Ss from either racial group were more likely to recognize faces of their own race and more likely to have a false alarm to faces of the other race. Latinos and Asians also were less accurate in their recognition of Black faces than Black Ss, but they were no less accurate in their recognition of White faces than White Ss. Face recognition was more accurate when Ss from any of the racial groups were induced to be in unpleasant moods vs pleasant moods. However, mood did not interact with the CRR effect, and thus mood is unlikely to be a mediating variable for the effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Aims: Blunts are hollowed-out cigars used to smoke marijuana (and perhaps other substances) in the United States. We investigated rates of blunt use; whether cigar use reported in surveys may actually be blunt use; the relationship of blunt to cigar use; characteristics of blunt users; brands of cigars used to make blunts; and drugs added to blunts. Design: A school-based survey of youth, the Cigar Use Reasons Evaluation (CURE). Setting: Eleven schools across Massachusetts. Participants: A total of 5016 students in grades 7-12. Measurements: CURE items assessing blunt, cigar and cigarette use, brands used to make blunts, drugs added to blunts and demographics were used. Findings: Life-time blunt use was reported by 20.0% of the sample, with use greater among high school (25.6%) than middle school (11.4%) students, and among males (23.7%) than females (16.6%). Self-reported cigar use rates were not influenced strongly by blunt use being misreported as cigar use. In a multivariate model, blunt use was associated with male gender, higher grade in school, lower GPA, truancy, lower school attachment, not living in a two-parent family, being of 'other' race/ethnicity and current use of both cigarettes and cigars. 'Phillies' was the most popular brand of cigar for making blunts, used by 59.5% of users. 'Garcia y Vega' (18.0%) was the second most popular. Twenty-eight per cent of blunt users had added drugs other than marijuana to blunts. Conclusions: The use of blunts as a drug delivery device is a serious problem. Efforts to address it will require the cooperation of the tobacco control and substance abuse prevention systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Examined the effects of the racial composition of a classroom on 257 Black and 216 White 4th–7th grade students' cross-race and same-race friendships. Two theories of interracial sociability were considered. The 1st argues that interracial friendliness is affected primarily by the number of opportunities students have for cross-race interaction relative to same-race interaction; it predicts that students in the numerical minority are likely to make more cross-race friendship choices than those in the majority. The 2nd theory claims that the racial minority is socially threatened by the majority and tends to isolate itself from the more dominant and powerful other race. These predictions were examined over a school year in a longitudinal data set of Ss in 18 desegregated classes. The results of sociometric questionnaires given at 6 time points over the school year provide strong support for the opportunity hypothesis and show little evidence that being in the racial minority diminishes interracial friendliness. Cross-sectional analyses showed that as the proportion of 1 racial group in the classroom increased, the friendlier the Ss of the other race were toward members of that racial group.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine differences in responses to the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CGSQ) between African American and White caregivers of children with emotional and behavioral challenges. Significant item- and scale-level differences were detected across groups with African Americans consistently reporting less strain. We examined whether these differences were more likely due to nonequivalent measurement than to real differences in the experience of caregiver strain. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the model fit the data well for both racial groups, but there were some differences in structural components. Internal consistency was equivalent across the groups. In an examination of criterion validity, regression analyses showed that African American caregivers experienced a slower rate of increase in objective caregiver strain at a given increase in child internalizing problems. No other race differences were found in the regression analyses. In general, we conclude that the CGSQ can be useful for detecting caregiver strain and identifying family support needs for both White and African American caregivers. Differences across groups in reports of caregiver strain, however, call for more research on racial differences in the impact on the family of caring for a child with emotional and behavioral disorders.

Method: Two data sets were used: 1) all suicides in Fulton County, Ga., from January 1994 through December 2002 and 2) all U.S. suicides reported by the National Center for Injury Prevention in 1999 and 2000. Results: The population rates for suicide in Fulton County were 1.22 per 100,000 black females, 10.74 per 100,000 black males, 9.89 per 100,000 white females, and 21.04 per 100,000 white males. In Fulton County, age at completed suicide was more than a decade lower in blacks than in whites. The median age of black victims was 32 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 23-45, and the median for whites was 44 years (IQR=31-58); the difference was significant. The mean ages of victims who were black (mean=36.1 years, SD=17.0) and of "other" race (mean=35.7, SD=14.3) were significantly lower than the mean for whites (mean=46.2, SD=18.5). The national data were similar, but minorities accounted for an even smaller percentage of suicides. Median age at completed suicide for African Americans nationally was 34 years (IQR=24-45) compared to 44 years (IQR=32-58) for Caucasians. Conclusions: African Americans commit suicide at rates much lower than those for whites, but they do so when much younger and they have a narrow, age-defined window of vulnerability. Age-specific psychopathological processes and protective factors may define suicide risk for each demographic group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The social behavior of a group of 10 2- and 3-year-old children attending a southern interracial nursery school was studied. Each child was observed for 10½ hours during the fall and 4½ hours during the spring. The written observations were analyzed by a method in which the records are broken down into behavior units and are scored on several behavior categories. The results indicate that the majority of the children showed some type of racial awareness. No general trends were found to indicate differences in scores on the behavior categories received by members of each racial group, nor in the relative frequency of scores received by the children during interaction with members of the same or the other race. It was concluded that the physical differences associated with race did not significantly influence the type or degree of social interaction the children had with other members of the group.

Abstract = {Cervical cancer occurs more frequently among Vietnamese Americans than women of any other race/ethnicity. In addition, previous studies in California have documented low Papanicolaou (Pap) testing rates in Vietnamese communities. This study focused on health care system factors and physician characteristics associated with recent cervical cancer screening among Vietnamese women. A population-based survey was conducted in Seattle during 2002. In-person interviews were conducted by bilingual, bicultural female survey workers. The survey response rate was 82% and 518 women were included in the analysis. Seventy-four percent of the respondents reported having been screened for cervical cancer on at least one occasion, and 64% reported a Pap smear within the previous 2 years. Women with a regular doctor were more likely to have been recently screened than those without a regular doctor (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.45-3.74). Among those with a regular doctor, having a male physician, receiving care at a private doctor's office (rather than a community, hospital, or multi-specialty clinic), and concern about the cost of health care were independently associated with lower screening rates. Physician ethnicity was not associated with recent Pap smear receipt. The findings support targeted interventions for Vietnamese women without a regular physician and private doctors' offices that serve Vietnamese Americans. The availability of low cost screening services should be publicized in Vietnamese communities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This study examined the impact of three program-level factors (coercion level, type of antipsychotic prescribed, and guardian supervision) on antipsychotic medication adherence among parolees mandated to an outpatient psychiatric clinic. Overall, 70.7% of the participants tested positive for their prescribed antipsychotic. Older patients were more likely to test positive for their prescribed antipsychotic than younger patients, and African American patients (relative to all other race/ethnic groups) were less likely. With regard to program-level factors, perceived coercion was not significantly associated with medication adherence. However, being prescribed an atypical antipsychotic and having a guardian were independently associated with increased adherence, and combined, these two factors were associated with nearly a tenfold increase in the likelihood of patients testing positive for their prescribed antipsychotic agent, relative to patients who were prescribed conventional antipsychotics and were not under guardian supervision.

Abstract = {380 respondents to a national election survey were interviewed by telephone on the issue of affirmative action (AFA). Framing the issue as unfair advantage (UA) and not as reverse discrimination produced opinions on AFA among Whites that were more coherent with their views on other race policies; associated more closely with their opinions on policies plausibly but not explicitly implicating race (e.g., welfare); and linked more to negative emotions provoked by preferential treatment. The UA framing also produced opinions among Whites that were more consistent with general political views, more evocative of prejudice and misgivings over equal opportunity, and less evocative of tangible threats that AFA may pose to family and group and of political principles that AFA might violate.

Abstract = {Tested the prediction that increased perceptual differentiation of other-group faces could reduce prejudicial attitudes. Ss were 96 black and white 2nd- and 6th-grade children who previously obtained high prejudice scores on 2 racial attitude measures (a projective prejudice test and a social distance index). Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 training conditions: (a) learning distinctive names for photographs of other-race faces; (b) making same-different judgments of facial pairs, or (c) observing the faces without labels. Race of E was varied within each group. Attitude tests were subsequently readministered, and findings confirm the hypothesis. Posttest prejudice scores of the labeling and perceptual training groups were lower than those of the control Ss. Additionally, data show that this treatment effect was influenced by both developmental level and race of E. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The present study tested the hypothesis that European and African Ss differ from each other in the cues they use to discriminate among faces of their own and of the other race. Ss reported the cues by carrying out sorting of triads of faces, and subsequently rating all faces on these cues. Individual differences multidimensional scaling analyses were applied to the data. With racially homogeneous sets of faces, Europeans (30 undergraduates) and Africans (30 undergraduates) did not differ in the basis on which judgments were made, although both used different bases for African than for European faces. When a racially heterogeneous set of faces was used, European Ss discriminated primarily in terms of racial features, but African Ss used a greater variety of cues.

Abstract = {Racial prejudice in the courtroom is examined through a historical sketch of racism in the legal system, a review of psychological research on White juror bias, and a study investigating White mock jurors' judgments of a fictional trial summary. The central hypothesis is that salient racial issues at trial activate the normative racial attitudes held by White jurors. In previous eras, these racial norms encouraged overtly anti-Black prejudice. But in modern America, many Whites embrace an egalitarian value system and try to behave in an appropriately nonprejudiced manner when race is salient. Therefore, contrary to the intuition of many scholars and researchers, contemporary White jurors are more likely to demonstrate racial bias against a Black defendant in interracial trials without blatantly racial issues. Empirical data suggest that this pattern of bias is not limited to one type of crime or one type of racial issue. Practical implications and future research directions are considered.

Methods: CIS callers assigned to the intervention group (n=200) received a brief educational intervention and an estimate of breast cancer risk over the telephone at the end of usual service. Follow-up interviews were completed by telephone at 1 month (n=367). Results: On average, women overestimated their risk by 25 percentage points. Eighty percent of the respondents rated their risk of breast cancer higher than did the assessment tool.

Abstract = {In adults, three phenomena are taken to demonstrate an experience effect on face recognition: an inversion effect, a non-native face effect (so-called 'other-race' effect) and their interaction. It is crucial for our understanding of the developmental perception mechanisms of object processing to discover when these effects are present in childhood. Three- to 5-year-old Caucasian children (N = 64) were asked to recognize upright and inverted Caucasian and Asian faces. Recognition was tested with a forced-choice procedure. Overall performance improved with age. However, there was an interaction between the inversion and non-native effects that did not change with age between ages 3 and 5: (a) the inversion effect with native (Caucasian) faces was larger than with non-native (Asian) faces, and (b) upright native faces were recognized better than upright non-native faces. These results show that face orientation and morphology constrain face processing in 3- to 5-year-olds. The first 3 years of life during which the brain and the environment interact are sufficient to build a face-processing system that constrains recognition.

Independent variables included demographic characteristics, case-processing variables, and maltreatment characteristics. Results showed that 60.2% of CPS investigations conducted were evaluated as unfounded, about 22% were categorized as founded, and 17% were classified as indicated. For the first level of substantiation, case processing variables were significant predictors of founded/indicated status. In the second-level substantiation MLR model, cases in the mid-range income level had a lower probability of being founded than those of less than $15,000, and reports involving Hispanic children were more likely than the "all other" race-ethnic social classification to have been substantiated as founded. This suggests that a 3-tiered rather than a 2-tiered system is a more accurate representation of the CPS substantiation process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants were 50 HIV-positive women ranging in age from 23-48 yrs, with 60% of the sample African American, 24% Latina, 6% White and 10% mixed/other race. Descriptive and canonical correlation analyses mere used to investigate the interrelationships between patients' empowered behaviors and self-reported interactions with their providers. Positive associations were noted between patients' medical decision-making involvement and patient-provider interactions. Patients reporting greater decision-making involvement, had higher levels of communication with their providers, and received more information and positive affect from their providers. Health care providers of HIV-positive women are encouraged to cultivate empowered behaviors in their patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In this study, interviews were conducted with 135 HIV symptomatic or AIDS diagnosed mothers (aged 23-52 yrs) of young, well children aged 6-11 yrs. White mothers were less likely to be severely ill than all other race/ethnic groups. The mean level of depression was elevated among this sample, and was associated with poorer cohesion in the family, and with poorer family sociability. Depression also was associated with the mothers being less able to perform tasks that they typically do; children of more depressed mothers had increased responsibilities for household tasks.

However minority group members, especially Hispanics, were more likely to prefer personal interviews. Most women provided consistent reports (if number of sex partners on the two modes, 12.6 percent reported more sex partners with audio-CASI, and 4.0 percent reported more partners in the personal interview. Hispanic women and women of 'other' race/ethnicity were significantly more likely to have decreased reporting of sex partners with audio-CASI.

Four focus group interviews were conducted with HIV-positive individuals (N=39) who were receiving antiretroviral medications at the time of the study. Participants ranged in age from 33 to 54 years, 69% were male, with 44% African-American, 39% White and 12% Latino/other race. Qualitative analyses were used to uncover patterns of patient involvement with their health care providers. Transcripts revealed four primary themes regarding patients' participation with providers in antiretroviral treatment decision making: joint decision making between patients and providers, patients taking control of their drug treatment decisions, initial passivity followed by increased involvement, and patients as knowledge gatherers. HIV/AIDS patients were generally active in making treatment decisions with their providers, garnering information about antiretroviral treatments from a variety of sources including peers, family members, health professionals and the media. Patient passivity in decision-making involvement was found only after initial HIV-positive diagnosis. Implications for patients' apparent empowered position are discussed.

Abstract = {To avoid the cultural complications resulting from the use of complex tasks, and in order to obtain a measure of capacity to learn, both white and negro subjects (3 groups: college, high school, and CCC camp) were made to bisect a magnitude of 305 mm. repeatedly for 5 sittings, a total of 250 times. The subjects performed with the knowledge that their race was being compared with members of the other race to provide motivation. Comparisons were made of the average error, the constant error, and the adjustmental error. The results show that the average errors (daily) of both racial groups decreased with training. White subjects made lower average errors than negroes in the discriminations, but the reliability of the difference between the two groups decreased with training. Logarithmic curves that were fitted to the learning curves as a convenient empirical description of the data indicated a convergence of the learning curves of the two racial groups in each of the comparisons. These results are interpreted to mean that the white subjects had had more training in this kind of performance at the beginning of the study. On the basis of the average error, the negroes learned faster than the whites, i.e., their increments of gain from sitting to sitting were larger than the increments for the whites. The constant errors of both racial groups tended to the right. The adjustmental errors of both groups tended to be over the center in most cases. There was no correlation between visual acuity and average error or between eyedness and direction of the constant error. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Analysis of mammography use was restricted to 6,353 women who were 40+ yrs of age. Low income was a strong predictor of mammography underuse, as was Hispanic ethnicity and other race, low educational attainment, age greater than 65 yrs, and residence in a rural area. A strong predictor of never having had a Pap smear was never having been married. Hispanic women and women of other races of all ages and all income levels underused Pap smear screening, as did older women, particularly older Black women.

The frequency of help given to 4 black or white, male or female confederates pretending to be deaf by 160 hearing black or white, male or female potential helpers was noted. Results show that when males helped individuals of their own race, as opposed to the other race, sex was a critical factor; females were helped more than males. When males helped females, race was not related to helping. When males helped males, white males helped the black male more than the white male. When females helped individuals of their own race, sex was not a critical factor. Sex was critical when help was given to females of the other race only for black females, who helped the black more than the white females. Contrasts are drawn between this study and earlier ones which had race and/or sex unrepresented for helpers and/or dependent confederates.

Three kinds of behavior toward the adult were measured: physical distancing, imitation, and helping.

On all 3 types of behavior, the White E was favored over the Black E in both the wheelchair and nonwheelchair conditions. In addition, there were interaction effects involving race, handicap, age, and sex that suggest the operation of complex developmental processes in the formation of attitudes toward different types of stigmatized individuals.

Abstract = {Leadership peer ratings from 64 Negro and 469 white basic airmen from 9 flights provided a "Negro peer status" score based on ratings by Negroes, and a "white peer status" score based on ratings by whites. It is concluded: 1. Ratings of members of ones own race are higher than are ratings of members of the other race. 2. "A significant interaction indicates that the first conclusion is not true for every flight or to the same extent in each flight. 3. In general, individuals of both races can agree on the rank order of leadership ability in a flight regardless of race (r = .76)." 4. The bias present is far from complete as evidenced by the degree of overlap of the 2 distributions of leadership ratings.

Abstract = {Following a review of sociometric studies of peer preferences in desegregated schools, 2 studies—a meta-analysis of 20 previous studies and an original field study—are reported that indicate that when peer preferences are measured by peer nomination, the assessed in-group preference is stronger than when a roster-and-rating measure is used. In the authors' present study, 97 male and 95 female 6th graders (103 Black and 89 White Ss) completed 2 questionnaires toward the end of the school year. On the roster-and-rating questionnaire, Ss rated the degree to which they would like to have each of their classmates as a work and as a play partner; on the 2nd questionnaire, Ss nominated 3 classmates they would most like to have as a work and as a play partner. Each S had 4 nomination and 4 rating scores: (a) S's own race and own sex, (b) S's own sex and other race, (c) S's opposite sex and own race, and (d) S's opposite sex and other race. Findings suggest that research on peer preferences should use a variety of dependent measures; whereas peer nominations are useful in assessing friendships, the roster-and-rating method may be better suited to the assessment of general intergroup acceptance.

Abstract = {Examined the hypothesis that differential orienting strategies for own- and other-race faces are responsible for the superiority of own-race over other-race face recognition. 48 White and Black undergraduates viewed 32 White and Black faces following inferential or superficial judgment or intentional learning instructions. Ss in the intentional learning condition were told that the experimenter was interested in how well they could recognize faces of their own and of another race. Ss in the inferential and superficial orienting task conditions were told that they were participating in an RT experiment testing their ability to make differential judgments about persons whose photographs they would be shown. Ss who received superficial instructions were also asked to decide as rapidly as possible whether the person in the photograph was friendly or unfriendly. Results show that experimentally inducing a superficial orienting strategy depressed both own- and other-race recognition scores well below those obtained through both inferential and intentional instructions. Recognition performances under these latter 2 conditions were equivalent for both Black and White Ss. The orienting task manipulation influenced recognition performance, but there was no evidence that it was responsible for the differential recognition effect.

Abstract = {One of the most remarkable epochs in the history of human thought is that through which we have passed in the last half of the nineteenth century. One after the other we have seen the lower sciences revivified, reconstructed, transformed by the new knowledge. The sciences dealing with man in society have naturally been the last to be affected, but now that the movement has reached them the changes therein promise to be even more startling in character. History, economics, the science of politics, and, last but not least important, the attitude of science to the religious life and the religious phenomena of mankind, promise to be profoundly influenced. The whole plan of life is, in short, being slowly revealed to us in a new light, and we are beginning to perceive that it presents a single majestic unity, throughout every part of which the conditions of law and orderly progress reign supreme. Nothing is more remarkable in this period of reconstruction than the change which is almost imperceptibly taking place in the minds of the rising generation respecting the great social and religious problem of our time. We have lived through a period when the very foundations of human thought have been rebuilt. That the moral law is the unchanging law of progress in human society is the lesson which appears to be written over all things. No school of theology has ever sought to enforce this teaching with the directness and emphasis which it appears that evolutionary science will in the future be justified in doing. In the silent and strenuous rivalry in which every section of the race is of necessity continually engaged, permanent success appears to be invariably associated with the ethical and moral conditions favourable to the maintenance of a high standard of social efficiency, and with those conditions only. No one who engages in a serious study of the period of transition through which our Western civilisation is passing at the present time can resist the conclusion that we are rapidly approaching a time when we shall be face to face with social and political problems, graver in character and more far-reaching in extent than any which have been hitherto encountered. These problems are not peculiar to any nationality included in our civilisation. But in the method of their solution, the social efficiency of the various sections of the Western peoples will probably be put to a severer test than any which it has yet had to undergo. Those who realise, however dimly, the immense part which the English-speaking peoples--if true to their own traditions--are not improbably destined to play in the immediate future of the world, will feel how great a gain any advance may be which enables us through the methods of modern science to obtain a clear perception of the stern, immutable conditions of moral fitness and uprightness through which alone a people can long continue to play a great part on the stage of the world. No other race has ever looked out upon such an opportunity as presents itself before these peoples in the twentieth century. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (preface)},

Both blacks and whites at all 3 grade levels chose significantly more members of their own race than members of the other race; blacks rejected whites significantly less than would be expected by chance, an effect which increased over time for older pupils; and, initially, whites rejected blacks less frequently than expected by chance, but shifted to approximately chance rejection of blacks. In January and February 1971, 2 observers counted interactions among pupils in each grade for 10 min for 5 wks. As expected, interactions increased significantly with grade level; however, subsequent analysis revealed that the primary variable determining interracial interactions is the proportion of blacks to whites in the classroom. A relatively low proportion of minority members (black or white) appears to be most effective in improving interracial relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Observed the peer interactions of 69 White and 32 Black 8th graders each week of a semester. The race and sex of the person with whom S was interacting were coded, as were the behavior's mutuality (one-sided, mutual), affective tone (positive, neutral, negative), and orientation (task oriented, ambiguous, social). Considerably more cross-race interaction was noted than found in previous studies conducted in nonacademic settings in interracial schools. Ss interacted significantly more with peers of their own race than with peers of the other race. This was due to the females' strong own-race preference. Males interacted cross-racially at approximately the rate that would be expected if race were not a factor in interactant choice. Male interactions were predominantly mutual in nature, whereas those of females were predominantly one-sided. There were no major differences in the tone of the inter- or intraracial interactions of Ss in the 4 sex–race subgroups. Negative behaviors constituted less than 1% of all interactions. Cross-race interactions of all groups were more task related than within-race interactions, within-race interactions were more social than cross-race interactions.

Both groups indicated they could feel comfortable with a higher percentage of the other race present than they preferred. However, blacks required fewer persons of their own race on their floors or in their buildings to feel comfortable than did whites. Both groups agreed that it was uncomfortable to be the only person attitudes their race on a floor or in a building. Both groups expressed preference for at least 50% occupancy by persons of their own race on their floor or in their building. A sizable minority in each group preferred own-group numerical dominance to 75% or more of the total. Interracial room-sharing, an unfamiliar experience for Ss, was acceptable, but objections to room-sharing were greater among blacks. A majority of both groups believed that voluntary segregation had occurred in the dormitories. Voluntary segregation was perceived as desirable by blacks, undesirable by whites.

Abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments to determine how initial task experiences of success and failure combine with observation of task outcomes of same-age, same-sex peers to affect the achievement expectations of 2nd and 3rd graders. Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: The problems were solvable (success) or unsolvable (failure), or there were no problems (no feedback). Results of both experiments, the 1st with 75 lower-class urban Black children, and the 2nd with 75 middle-class rural White children, show that Ss' expectations were increased by their own success and the observed success of peers and were lowered by both direct and vicarious failure. However, Black and White Ss differed in their response to conditions that were designed to determine the relative influence of Black vs White comparison others. Lower-class Black Ss were more influenced by same-race comparison others only after a relatively unexpected initial outcome (failure for boys and success for girls), whereas middle-class White Ss showed a tendency to be more influenced by same-race others, regardless of their prior task experience. Achievement motivation and differential familiarity with other-race children are offered as possible explanations for this difference.

Abstract = {The Egyptians were the most pious people of antiquity. They seem to have expended more time and energy in religious observances, and to have had a more realistic conception of a future life, than any other race. Their writings, says M. Maury, "are full of sacred symbols and allusions to divine myths, perfectly useless apart from the Egyptian religion. Literature and the sciences were only branches of the theology, while its books formed a sacred code, supposed to be the work of the god Thoth, likened by the Greeks to their Hermes. The arts were only practised to add to the worship and glorification of the gods or deified kings. "The religious observances were so numerous and so imperative that it was impossible to practise a profession, to prepare food, or to attend to the simplest daily needs without constantly calling to mind the rules established by the priests. Each province had its special gods, its particular rights, its sacred animals. Neither the dominion of the Persians, nor that of the Ptolemies, nor that of the Romans, was able to change this antique religion of the Pharaohs; of all polytheisms, it opposed the most obstinate resistance to Christianity, and continued to live on up to the sixth century of our era. It is because the Egyptian religion had penetrated so deeply into the mind of the people and the customs of the country, that it became, so to speak, a part of the intellectual and physical organization of the race."

Tests with evident social desirability responses showed a decline in prejudice attitudes with age. In contrast, projective tests revealed racial attitudes to be constant across age groups. In Exp. II, 2nd, 4th, and 6th graders viewed slides of facial pairs varying systematically along a number of attributes, including color and shade. Ss assessed the similarity of the 2 faces by means of a continuous motoric scale. Results indicate that color was a more dominant cue with a black E. Additionally, an interaction between perceptual ratings and ages was obtained with a white E, whereby younger Ss viewed other race pairs as more distinctive, while older Ss judged other-race stimuli as more similar.

The corrected sentence is provided. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]1974-11015-001[/rid].) Conducted a field experiment in Grand Central Station in New York City to examine the effects of race and sex on helping dependent deaf persons. The frequency of help given to 4 black or white, male or female confederates pretending to be deaf by 160 hearing black or white, male or female potential helpers was noted. Results show that when males helped individuals of their own race, as opposed to the other race, sex was a critical factor; females were helped more than males. When males helped females, race was not related to helping. When males helped males, white males helped the black male more than the white male. When females helped individuals of their own race, sex was not a critical factor. Sex was critical when help was given to females of the other race only for black females, who helped the black more than the white females. Contrasts are drawn between this study and earlier ones which had race and/or sex unrepresented for helpers and/or dependent confederates. Results are discussed in light of a race-sex linked ingratiation effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {40 White undergraduates judged the degree of apparent resemblance of pairs of Japanese and pairs of White American faces using a 10-step psychometric scale. Judgments were made either in a "perceptual" condition (both faces seen simultaneously) or in a "memory" condition (sequential presentation, zero time between faces). Mean resemblance judgments were not affected by the method of presenting the pairs. Contrary to the results obtained in earlier investigations, Japanese and all women's faces were judged to be significantly more alike than White and all men's faces. No interactions were significant. These data, considered alone, support the hypothesis that Japanese faces are perceived to be more alike than White faces, but when considered in the context of earlier studies, the data are not compelling evidence for the homogeneity hypothesis. It is unlikely that the other-race memory effect can be accounted for by the differences in judged similarity of Japanese compared to White faces.

Abstract = {The relation of philosophy to war is a question that has occupied many of the most powerful minds in all countries through all ages. The study of that question has lately received a new impetus on account of the terrible events now in progress throughout the continent of Europe. People in general scarcely realise how different has been the outlook of English philosophers. It is natural that the country most abandoned to the ideals of militarism should have produced the philosophers most sympathetic to those ideals. We in this country sometimes forget that we have in the past been the least military of all the nations of Europe. And many are scarcely aware that the main philosophic attacks upon the doctrines of militarism have come from English thinkers, and reached their climax last century in the writings of Herbert Spencer. Undoubtedly the main interest of Spencer's works at present is on the social side. His scientific and evolutionary writings have already become part of the "atmosphere" of modern thought, in the sense that they scarcely need to be taught, but constitute the foundation upon which more recent ideas are built. But his social writings have not in the same way become axiomatic. On the contrary, the political tendencies before the war were all hostile to Spencer's teaching. Spencer's position in philosophy is a comparatively isolated one. He received little from the writings of previous philosophers, but much from the science of his own time. Nevertheless his philosophic affinities were with the naturalistic, and even the materialistic, thinkers of the past, rather than with the idealists or the metaphysicians. His social philosophy, pivoting on liberty and the limitations of State-duties, is so pre-eminently English that it is impossible to imagine the production of such a work in any other race of people. The outbreak of a new and far more terrible war has already done much to break up the political agnosticism which had settled over a large section of the British people. We are once again in the presence of real issues. We are no longer drifting slowly along the placid stream of social reform, increasing month by month our stock of legislative enactments, and adding year by year to the powers of the Government over the individual. Circumstances have driven us headlong to a consummation which in many spheres touches the limit to which previous legislation was gradually progressing. A true biography of Spencer must consist chiefly of an account of his works. He was one of those authors of whom it may be most truly said that his works were much greater than himself; and all the best of him will be found in his philosophy. His personality, outside his works, was meagre and petty. In this biography, therefore, I shall devote the greater part of the space to an account of his writings, in which he sacrificed the greater part of his personality.

Prejudiced and unprejudiced whites predicted the Negro rankings with modest accuracy (r's = .51 and .79). The Negroes' estimate of white preferences correlated highly (r = .82) with the rankings of the prejudiced whites only. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},
