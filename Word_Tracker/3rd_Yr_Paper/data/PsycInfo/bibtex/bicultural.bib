Abstract = {The present study extends the Hopelessness Model of Depression through: (a) investigating the applicability of bicultural stress as precipitant in this model, (b) expanding mental health outcomes in addition to depression (i.e., life satisfaction), and (c) examining the protective role that male and female caregiver connection may play in disrupting this model for Mexican descent adolescents. With a sample of 524 Mexican descent adolescents (46.9% male; 53.1% female; age range: 14–20; M = 16.23 years; SD = 1.10 years), 2 structural equation models were tested, The first model (Theoretical Model) sought to determine the relationship between bicultural stress, life satisfaction, and depressive symptoms with hopelessness as a mediator. The second model (Protective Factor Model) investigated both male and female caregiver connectedness as potential protective factors in the bicultural stress-mental health relationships. Both models were supported. In the Theoretical Model, hopelessness mediated the relationship between bicultural stress and the mental health variables (i.e., depression and life satisfaction). Additionally, in the Protective Factor Model, female caregiver connection moderated the relationships between bicultural stress and life satisfaction, highlighting that female caregiver connection is a protective factor in the bicultural stress-life satisfaction relationship. Findings will be discussed from a resilience perspective with recommendations of how practitioners can use these findings for mental health prevention and intervention purposes.

Abstract = {Research has indicated that Hispanics have high rates of heavy drinking and depressive symptoms during late adolescence. The purpose of this study was to test a bicultural transaction model composed of two enthnocultural orientations (acculturation and enculturation); and stressful cultural transactions with both the U.S. culture (perceived ethnic discrimination) and Hispanic culture (perceived intragroup marginalization) to predict alcohol use severity and depressive symptoms among a sample of 129 (men = 39, women = 90) late adolescent Hispanics (ages 18–21) enrolled in college. Results from a path analysis indicated that the model accounted for 18.2% of the variance in alcohol use severity and 24.3% of the variance in depressive symptoms. None of the acculturation or enculturation domains had statistically significant direct effects with alcohol use severity or depressive symptoms. However, higher reports of ethnic discrimination were associated with higher reports of alcohol use severity and depressive symptoms. Similarly, higher reports of intragroup marginalization were associated with higher depressive symptoms. Further, both ethnic discrimination and intragroup marginalization functioned as mediators of multiple domains of acculturation and enculturation. These findings highlight the need to consider the indirect effects of enthnocultural orientations in relation to health-related outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The bicultural work motivations of Asian Americans have not yet been comprehensively captured by contemporary vocational constructs and scales. For this study, we conducted two studies on the initial reliability and validity of the Bicultural Work Motivation Scale (BWMS) by combining qualitative and quantitative methods. First, a pilot study was conducted with 14 Asian American college students to assess their motivation to work, and items were generated from the themes developed in the qualitative analysis. Results from the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a stable four-factor structure of the BWMS: Honoring Parents, Family Financial Obligation, Fulfilling Personal Interest, and Being Independent. Adequate reliability and evidence for concurrent and discriminant validity are presented. Implications of the scale for further vocational assessment and research are discussed.

Abstract = {It has been suggested that in foreign language learning and ELF situations, identity might not be implicated in any great extent. Focusing on the impact globalization has on identities, the purpose of this study is to consider whether identity might be involved in Swedish students’ reasons for enrolling on an English-medium university program and, if so, the types of identities students construct. Analyses of data from interviews with 11 students revealed that identities do play a role in students’ enrollment reasons. However, rather than the bicultural identities identified in previous motivational research, the identities emerging here appear hybrid in nature. Along with other recent research, the results indicate that in contexts where English has a prominent social/societal/cultural presence it is implicated in identity construction, and that there is a relationship between identity and ELF.

Abstract = {Research has found that Mexican American adolescents report higher levels of depressive symptoms than Whites and African Americans. For these youth, bicultural stress from navigating between their culture of origin and the mainstream U.S. culture can have negative mental health effects including higher levels of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. This study looks at the effects of bicultural stress and gender on depression and suicidal ideation of 516 Mexican American adolescents. Hierarchical linear and logistic regressions were performed to determine the affect of gender, bicultural stressors, and their interaction on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Results indicate gender moderates the effect of several bicultural stressors on mental health outcomes, with boys being more affected by high levels of stress in areas when interaction effects were present. Discussion of results is framed within the intersection of ethnicity and gender role socialization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Adolescent aggression and delinquency impede healthy adjustment in early adulthood and may have particularly serious long-term consequences for minority youth. Therefore, prevention research should examine these behaviors within a sociocultural framework among newer immigrant samples to determine whether, and how, adaptation to life in the US affects these behaviors. This study investigated the role of two sociocultural variables–bicultural stress and negative context of reception–on changes in aggression and rule breaking behaviors over two time points among recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents residing in Los Angeles (N = 136) and Miami-Dade (N = 142) counties. Linear stepwise regression models were used to assess the associations between predictors and behavioral outcomes. Bicultural stress and negative context of reception both had independent associations, above and beyond parental involvement and delinquent peer associations, with changes in aggressive and rule-breaking behavior during the first year of high school. These findings suggest that social, cultural, and interpersonal processes all influence deviant behaviors in recent-immigrant Hispanic populations. We discuss the implications of these finding for prevention and intervention research and practice. We also recommend that future research continue to examine the role of these factors over the course of adolescence and consider sociocultural influences when designing behavioral interventions for Hispanic immigrant populations (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study examined, in a sample of recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents in Miami and Los Angeles, the extent to which bicultural identity integration (BII; involving the ability to synthesise one's heritage and receiving cultural streams and to identify as a member of both cultures) is best understood as a developmental construct that changes over time or as an individual‐difference construct that is largely stable over time. We were also interested in the extent to which these trajectories predicted mental health and family functioning. Recent‐immigrant 9th graders (N = 302) were assessed 6 times from 9th to 12th grade. Latent class growth analyses using the first 5 timepoints identified 2 trajectory classes—one with lower BII scores over time and another with higher BII scores over time. Higher heritage and US identity at baseline predicted membership in the higher BII class. At the 6th study timepoint, lower BII adolescents reported significantly poorer self‐esteem, optimism, prosocial behaviour and family relationships compared with their higher BII counterparts. These findings are discussed in terms of further research on the over‐time trajectory of biculturalism, and on the need to develop interventions to promote BII as a way of facilitating well‐being and positive family functioning.

Abstract = {Understanding the value of monocultural acculturation orientation to the host culture (assimilation) and bicultural acculturation orientation (integration) for language learning is critical in guiding educational policy and practices for immigrant students. This study aimed to enhance our understanding on the relationship between acculturation orientation and second language (L2) learning. It generated two conceptual models to describe how cultural identification affects language learning as hypothesized in different theories on identity and L2 learning and tested these two hypothesized models in the immigration context of Hong Kong. A survey was conducted among a group of senior high school South Asian minority students on their learning of the language of the host culture, Chinese, to provide the basis for comparison. It was found that the students mainly adopted the bicultural/integration orientation and that bicultural orientation was the optimal acculturation orientation for learning Chinese. Bicultural orientation influenced the participants' Chinese language learning outcome through impacting psychosocial well-being and engagement with the target language and community. The findings suggest that we need to take both linguistic and psychosocial adjustment factors into consideration when conceptualizing the role of identity in L2 learning. Furthermore, this study cautions us against a context-independent stance toward the utility of assimilation for language learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Refugee populations are widely regarded as difficult to access for research purposes, often because of specific ethical sensitivities and practical challenges. Hence, research methods must be judiciously chosen and fine-tuned to ensure they are sufficiently sensitive and culturally appropriate. Bicultural Research Assistants, who typically share language and cultural similarities with respondents, may be gainfully employed to help address these challenges. By assuming a cultural ‘brokerage’ role, they are well positioned to advise the research team, helping to ensure culturally appropriate conduct throughout the study. Despite extensive use of participatory methods in qualitative studies, the experiences of Bicultural Research Assistants in research activities in tertiary hospital environments, particularly maternity care settings, are rarely reported. This paper addresses a deficit in the literature on this topic. It describes the roles and insights of five female Bicultural Research Assistants trained in basic research methods, and employed on an evaluation of a specialist antenatal clinic for women from refugee backgrounds. Their inclusion as members of the evaluation team was essential to successfully engaging (male) gatekeepers, recruiting eligible women, administering surveys, and conducting, transcribing, and translating interviews. Following the evaluation, the Bicultural Research Assistants contributed a one-off Focus group which explored their motivations for participating in the evaluation, and their experiences of occupying multiple roles as co-researchers, interpreters and respondents. Reported benefits included the acquisition of new skills, improved interprofessional relationships and greater acknowledgement of their roles and responsibilities by hospital staff and community stakeholders. Gender-related barriers were also described. Customary socio-cultural norms, which positioned women as relatively powerless and subservient, were frequently contravened by the Bicultural Research Assistants in their research roles.

Abstract = {This article examines how bicultural harmonization was achieved in a society exposed to acculturative stress for almost two centuries and discusses the implications of the historical experience of this bicultural society to clinical practice, cultural psychotherapy, and program development for bicultural populations. The setting being studied is Goa, a former Portuguese state on the western coast of India. Two cultural sub-groups, Hindus and Christians, continued to interact despite attempts to eliminate their bicultural exchange. The result was the formation of a vibrant hybrid culture, the Indo-Portuguese culture of Goa, and the minimization or prevention of demoralization. The findings highlight the importance of encouraging bicultural individuals to borrow values and norms from both cultures, switch between them in response to cultural cues, adapt themselves to both, synthesize norms of both, and apply those norms judiciously to particular situations. Programs designed to relieve distress and demoralization in bicultural individuals should aim at the promotion of harmonization rather than total assimilation.

Abstract = {Abstract As community and applied social psychologists, it is crucial that we know ourselves as cultural beings, appreciate the values and beliefs of those with whom we work and understand the history of relations among those in our work settings. In New Zealand, research by non‐Māori involving Māori has often mirrored the harmful colonising practices of the nation's wider history. In response, several frameworks have been developed setting out conditions and guidelines in which non‐Māori might conduct research in Māori settings responsibly and usefully. Nevertheless, views differ on the ways, and extent to which, non‐Māori might be involved. Most guidelines do not provide answers to ethical nuances that may arise. This article discusses the experiences of a non‐Māori community psychologist engaging in research in a predominantly Māori setting. It describes how the first author carefully negotiated entry into the setting, built relationships based on mutuality, sought expert guidance, exercised an ethic of caring, and ensured that the research was accountable to the community. We believe that there are important lessons here for researchers from dominant groups undertaking research in indigenous and minority communities. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Recently, researchers have paid attention to the attributional patterns of bicultural individuals and how they vary in response to different cultural primes. The current study aimed to investigate the role of language on activating cultural mindsets and influencing attributional patterns as a result among Chinese-Western bicultural individuals. The sample included 85 participants (21 men, 64 women) recruited via snowball sampling. Each participant was asked to divide up 100% responsibility between a dispositional cause and a situational cause for a series of events in an online survey in either English or Chinese. Results showed that Chinese-primed bicultural individuals made less situational attributions for positive events than English-primed bicultural individuals (d = .51) and that there was no difference in the amount of situational attributions for negative events made by participants in the two conditions. The total length of stay in Western countries did not correlate with the amount of situational attributions a bicultural individual made. The automatic thinking associated with the native language (Chinese) might have cancelled out the effect of cultural priming on the attributional patterns.

Using a developmental psychopathology framework, in the present study we examined the effect of bicultural stress on alcohol misuse among immigrated Hispanic adolescents, indirectly through trajectories of identity formation and alcohol expectancies. Our sample consisted of 302 recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents (53 % male; Mage = 14.5 at baseline) who were interviewed every 6 months for 3 years. Bivariate growth curve modeling was used to examine the influence of initial early bicultural stress on later alcohol misuse via change in identity development (i.e., coherence and confusion) and subsequent growth in cognitive alcohol expectancies. Findings revealed that initial levels and growth of identity coherence were not significantly associated with either bicultural stress or tension reduction (TR) alcohol expectancies. Multiple mediation analyses indicated that the effect of bicultural stress at time 1 on the frequency of being drunk at time 6 was mediated via high initial levels of identity confusion, followed by growth in risky TR expectancies (T4–T6).

Abstract = {This study examined whether Chinese American parents’ acculturation and enculturation were related to parenting practices (punitive parenting, democratic child participation, and inductive reasoning) indirectly through the mediation of parents’ bicultural management difficulty and parental depressed mood. Data came from a 2-wave study of Chinese American families in Northern California. Mothers and fathers were assessed when their children were in early adolescence and then again in middle adolescence (407 mothers and 381 fathers at Wave 1; 308 mothers and 281 fathers at Wave 2). For both waves, we examined cross-sectional models encompassing both direct and indirect links from parental cultural orientations to parenting practices. We also used individual fixed-effects techniques to account for selection bias in testing model relationships at Wave 2. At Wave 1, via bicultural management difficulty and depressive symptoms, American orientation was related to less punitive parenting and more inductive reasoning for both parents, and Chinese orientation was related to more punitive parenting and less inductive reasoning for fathers. The findings indicate that bicultural management difficulty and parental depressed mood are important mechanisms to be considered when studying the relation between Chinese American parents’ acculturation/enculturation and parenting.

The Goan acculturation took place in three stages. A relatively peaceful co-existence of the two groups, lasting about 30 years, was followed by almost 200 years of both Christianization and ‘westernization’ as well attempts to eliminate the interaction between Hindus and Christians. These attempts were unsuccessful and eventually the discriminatory practices were outlawed. A skillful collective use of adaptive strategies led to the prevention and minimization of demoralization and the creation of a vibrant hybrid culture, the Indo-Portuguese culture of Goa.

Abstract = {This article describes how the exchange of ideas and values between members of two different and conflicting cultures may persist despite systematic opposition under certain circumstances. Examples are drawn from the historical experience of Hindus and Christians in Goa, a former Portuguese state on the western coast of India, spanning over four centuries (from 1510 till 1961). Three types of mechanisms are described in terms of three aspects of the sociocultural system: structure (e.g., biological dispositions, availability of an exit, and preservation of the social framework), process (e.g., sharing of business interests and symbolic systems), and outcome (e.g., management of stigma and creation of a bicultural ambient world). The result was the creation of a hybrid vibrant culture, the Indo-Portuguese culture of Goa, and the minimization or prevention of demoralization.

Abstract = {Terror management theory (TMT) shows that familiarity and novelty seeking are two distinct ways of deriving meaning. In the present research, we applied this analysis to individuals with two cultural backgrounds. Three studies examined whether these two divergent responses to mortality salience (MS) correspond with varying degrees of identity hybridity among biculturals. Following MS, low hybridity led to more familiarity seeking in the form of a stronger need for structure (Study 1) and less novelty seeking in the form of reduced willingness to explore (Study 2). In contrast, high hybridity tended to lead to the opposite following MS, particularly heightened interest in educational programs that facilitate exploration (Study 3). Results further clarified that these effects occurred only if bicultural identity was primed first (Study 1) and that they could not be reduced to broad personality traits (Study 2 and 3). We conclude by discussing the implications of expanding TMT's critical insight into the conflictual side of intergroup contact in the globalized world to the hitherto unexplored side of biculturalism.

Abstract = {This study examines the role that the bicultural identity of members of an ethnic diaspora (the Indian diaspora in Canada and the United States) can play in affecting the level of economic engagement between their country of residence (COR) and country of origin (COO). Specifically, it examines how differences in bicultural identity can explain the varying levels of engagement by diasporic members in different trade and investment facilitation behaviors, and how the different components of bicultural identity, cultural distance, and cultural conflict, could affect the level of economic engagement between the diasporic members’ COR and COO. Results indicate that cultural distance and cultural conflict and their interaction do have a significant impact on economic engagement behaviors; these effects are complex and multifaceted and are mediated by the diaspora’s social networks in both the COR and COO.

Abstract = {Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) is a progressive, degenerative disease that occurs in the cerebral cortex due to increased levels of glutamate, the proliferation of plaque-forming amyloid beta proteins, and reactive gliosis. Establishing behavioral indicators of the disease (e.g., impairments of episodic memory) and use of neuroimaging technology that can substantiate medial temporal lobe brain structure deficiencies demonstrates an important clinical neuroanatomic relationship needed for early evaluation of possible AD diagnosis. This bilingual/bicultural case study details the cognitive and language impairments associated with AD over the course of 1 year. Utilization of a bilingual/bicultural case study may elucidate the pattern of language and cognitive decline in this understudied population.

This is occurring at the same time that school psychologists require increased professional development around effective practices and advocacy for bilingual students. Communities of practice (CoPs) are one potential solution as they aim to bring together various professionals into a working relationship around their common interests. They also bring stakeholders into the work of state education agencies as allies and bring fresh approaches to persistent problems by uniting decision makers, practitioners, and consumers around a common goal (IDEA Partnership, 2014).

Abstract = {Research has shown that many deaf students do not develop age-appropriate reading and writing abilities. This study evaluates the literacy skills of deaf students, hard of hearing students, and students with cochlear implants in bilingual/ bicultural schools in Denmark. The results show that 45 per cent of the students did not have any reading and writing difficulties (i.e. they were no more than 1 year behind in school). Regression analysis models show that language abilities (either aural-oral or signed) and additional disabilities were explaining factors. Neither the level of hearing loss nor cochlear implantation was found to be significantly related to literacy skills. The results are discussed in relation to the Danish bilingual/bicultural approach in deaf education, an approach which appears to improve literacy skills among students with hearing impairment but does not eliminate all literacy difficulties.

Abstract = {Bilingual individuals acquire their two languages either simultaneously or sequentially, which relates to how these languages are stored and represented in the brain. Because language is used to transmit culture, bilinguals’ mode of dual language acquisition may also relate to different perceptions of the corresponding two cultures as blended and fused versus separate and compartmentalized. With a sample of English–Spanish bilingual Mexican Americans (N = 149), we found that compound bilinguals (simultaneous dual language acquisition) blended their two cultures to a greater extent than coordinate bilinguals (sequential dual language acquisition), and this finding remained even after controlling for generation status. Our study highlights the interplay of language and culture, particularly the importance of the process of cultural learning and language acquisition to the bicultural experience.

Abstract = {A number of studies have focused on Bicultural Identity Integration (BII) to explore whether and how migrants and ethnic minorities, who experience multiple cultural belongings, perceive their two cultural backgrounds as compatible (vs. conflictual) and to study the impact of these differences on their psychosocial well-being. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research on BII among transracial adoptees, who also experience unique conditions of dual cultural belonging. Relying on a sample of 170 adopted adolescents born in Latin American countries and subsequently adopted in Italy (aged between 15 and 25) and both of their parents, the aim of the present study was twofold: to explore whether and the extent to which BII is related to adoptees’ behavioral problems and to analyze the influence of specific family and social identity variables on BII. Multivariate analyses using the structural equation modeling indicated that adoptive filiation (i.e., belonging to the adoptive family) and parents’ cultural socialization strategies are significant protective factors for national identity and ethnic identity, respectively, which in turn influences adoptees’ behavioral problems, but this relation is mediated by differences in BII.

Abstract = {In his acculturative family distancing (AFD) theory, Hwang (2006b) argued that acculturation gaps among parents and youth may lead to psychological and emotional distancing. AFD includes 2 dimensions: incongruent cultural values and breakdowns in communication. This study examined whether bicultural competence (BC) served as a mediator and moderator for the relationship between AFD and depression using structural equation modeling. Two hundred and forty-one Latino/a college students attending predominantly White, midwestern universities completed an online survey at 2 time points. For mediation, results indicated that BC at Time 2 (T2) mediated the relationship between AFD at Time 1 (T1) and depression at T2 above and beyond the effects of depression, acculturation, and enculturation at T1. A bootstrap method estimated the significance of the indirect effect. Moreover, 16% of the variance in BC at T2 was explained by acculturation, enculturation, and AFD at T1; 30% of the variance in depression at T2 was explained by BC at T2 and depression at T1. Post hoc analyses of the AFD and BC dimensions suggested that (a) positive attitudes toward both groups, communication ability, and social groundedness were significant mediators for the incongruent cultural values–depression link and (b) communication ability and social groundedness were significant mediators for the communication breakdown–depression link. For moderation, the AFD × BC interaction did not significantly predict depression at T2. Limitations, future research directions, and counseling implications are discussed.

Abstract = {In this chapter we synthesize extant scholarship and research to delineate the unique or specific socialization processes that are theorized as facilitating academic performance of bicultural children. We integrate two conceptual models that base the experience of being an underrepresented minority as a central feature of the developmental pathways and psychosocial processes of ethnic-minority children. We then use this integrated framework to organize our synthesis of empirical research on the adaptive familial processes and promotive features of children's socio-cultural contexts that lead to school achievement for bicultural youth. Potential pathways that are both theorized and tested through empirical research suggest that racial and ethnic socialization messages impact educational outcomes indirectly and directly through their impact on racial-ethnic identity and self-esteem. When parents provide messages of racial/cultural pride and optimally prepare their children for bias in extra-familial settings, such efforts have been shown to mediate the effects of discrimination so that children can function and flourish in educational settings. Research also highlights alternative pathways, in that racial and ethnic socialization have been found to effect educational outcomes by bolstering self-system processes. However, more recent research highlights the complex interplay between these familial and intrapersonal processes within the varied socio-cultural contexts of children's development. Here, salience of being a minority, sense of belonging in a setting, and the diversity of children's settings emerge at the forefront of analytic considerations.

Abstract = {A cross-national sample of 622 internationally adopted children from India with White parents in The Netherlands (n = 409), Norway (n = 146), and the United States (n = 67) was used to contrast country-specific bicultural socialization (BCS) practices among families of transracial intercountry adoption. The 3 countries vary in their degrees of minority (US > Netherlands > Norway) and Indian populations (US > Norway > Netherlands). The current study examined parental survey trends among BCS practices, children’s negative encounters about adoption, racial and positive discrimination, and parental worry about these issues. Country-specific differences were revealed: The United States and Norway (greatest Indian populations) reported the greatest similarity in BCS practices, classmates being a source of negative reactions/racial discrimination, and parental worry. The American sample encountered greater negative reactions to adoption from others; Dutch children experienced the least negative reactions from others overall, yet as in the United States (samples with the greatest minority heterogeneity) they still noted significant experiences of racial discrimination. Country-specific sociopolitical perceptions about adoption, ethnicity/race, and immigration are considered as factors that may have been used to inform parenting practices that facilitate children’s biculturalism into family life (i.e., adoptive family stigma, percentages of Indian/minority populations, immigration policy trends). Concluding, cross-national research such as the current study may help intercountry adoption policymakers and practitioners to better understand and inform BCS practices in adoptive families.

This chapter explores conceptions of bicultural identity and examines the contexts that influence it and the processes by which it is formed. Each individual is an agent in the construction of his or her cultural identity, through such processes as commitment, exploration, reconsideration, and negotiation. Nevertheless, the process is strongly influenced by the attitudes, values, and practices of the cultural settings in which he or she resides. To understand bicultural identity, we must consider the developing individual, the context in which formation takes place, and the interactions among them. Because of the complexity of these processes, there is need for further research on the topic, especially dynamic micro-level studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

First, this chapter offers an overview of the psychology of multiculturalism, including early definitions and typologies of multicultural experiences. Second, this chapter examines how bicultural identity integration (BII), the degree to which biculturals perceive their two cultural identities as compatible versus oppositional and fused versus compartmentalized, influences biculturals' cognitive and motivational processing. Third, a theoretical model called the Integrative Psychological Model of Biculturalism (IPMB) is proposed as a comprehensive framework for understanding the social-cognitive correlates of biculturalism. Specifically, the IPMB examines individual and contextual antecedents of variations in bicultural experience, and how these processes influence self-concept, cultural frame switching, knowledge bridging, cognitive complexity, motivation as well as their psychological, social, and behavioral outcomes. The IPMB has implications beyond biculturals to those managing multiple identities around gender, religion, and profession as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Against a backdrop of social struggles to rebalance power between colonisers and indigenous peoples, counsellor education at a university in Aotearoa New Zealand is undergoing a transformation. This article explores the creation and application of a framework that results from listening to the voices of indigenous peoples and counselling stakeholders. What is created is a form of bicultural pluralism – bicultural because the indigenous and coloniser have worked together to build cultural bridges, and pluralistic because the framework can be applied to all cultural groups equally. Our goal is to advance community wellness by increasing the capacity of counsellors to work effectively and cross-culturally, thus extending the health resource they can provide to the whole nation.

Abstract = {Bicultural Identity Integration (BII), or biculturals’ perceived compatibility between their two cultural identities, has been found to predict a variety of psychological processes and behavioral outcomes. However, it is not clear why biculturals differ in their levels of BII. We suggest that the valence of bicultural experiences influences BII. Furthermore, we predict that biculturals’ level of BII can be changed momentarily by recalling valenced bicultural experiences. An experimental study manipulating recall of positive or negative bicultural experiences found that recalling positive bicultural experiences increased BII, whereas recalling negative bicultural experiences decreased BII. However, recalling experiences irrelevant to bicultural experiences did not change BII. Theoretical and practical implications of the malleability of BII are discussed.

Abstract = {Through the use of the cultural-ecological-transactional theory of resilience, the present study seeks to determine if the cultural factors of familismo and ethnic identity have a protective effect and if bicultural stress has a risk effect on the positive psychological functioning of 191 Mexican American adolescents. Two hierarchical linear regressions were preformed to determine the direct and interaction effects of these factors on self-esteem and life satisfaction. Results indicate that familismo values and ethnic identity both significantly and positively predicted self-esteem and life satisfaction. Further, bicultural stress significantly and negatively predicted both self-esteem and life satisfaction. Additionally, there was a significant interaction effect between ethnic identity and bicultural stress on life satisfaction; however, the interaction was contrary to the hypothesis that high ethnic identity would protect against the effect of high levels of bicultural stress. Results are discussed within the cultural-ecological-transactional framework. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

They are fast becoming the norm in businesses and NGOs worldwide. The study examined team member's stereotypes as embedded in the complex environment that characterizes global teams. It contributes to the scarce research on stereotypes as embedded in contexts. The study explored the stereotypes of 120 Israelis and 80 Indians working in the high-tech industry. The conceptual frameworks of convergence, divergence and crossvergence and social identity theory provided the backdrop for the study’s hypotheses. The quantitative findings documented the existence of crossvergence in global and national stereotypes and of in-group favoritism. The qualitative findings revealed that Israelis and Indians created mirror pictures of two basic stereotype categories: work related and personal characteristic.

Abstract = {Studies of social judgment found that the way bicultural individuals respond to cultural cues depends on their cultural identity structure. Biculturals differ in the degree to which they represent their two cultural identities as integrated (vs. nonintegrated), which is assessed as high (vs. low) bicultural identity integration (BII), respectively. High BII individuals assimilate to cultural cues, yet low BII individuals contrast to these cues. The current studies reveal that this dynamic extends to consumer behavior and elucidate the underlying psychological mechanism. We found that high (low) BII individuals exhibit assimilation (contrast) responses to cultural cues in consumer information-seeking and choice. Furthermore, the pattern occurs with both subliminal (study 1) and supraliminal (study 2) cultural primes, and is mediated by the experience of identity exclusion threat (study 2). Results suggest that the interactive effect of BII and cultural cues arises from nonconscious defense against the exclusion of a cultural identity. Implications for self-protective processes, automatic behavior, and marketing are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: This article examines how symbols and sentiments are exchanged to produce a synthesis of two cultures in the context of prolonged bicultural conflict and interaction, thereby minimizing or preventing sociocultural disintegration and the resulting demoralization. This process will be shown to be anchored on the discovery of certain thematic areas (cultural receptors) in which social roles or cultural mandates are missing, unclear, ambiguous or congruent. Material: The setting of this research is the history of Goa, a former Portuguese state on the western coast of India, where the exchange between the Portuguese and Indian cultures lasted longer than four centuries (1510–1961). Both published and unpublished sources were studied. Discussion: From 1510, the year of the beginning of the Portuguese rule, until 1540, the local traditions and leadership patterns were respected. This was followed by a period of religious intolerance during which attempts were made to encourage Hindus to convert to Christianity and to wipe out the bicultural interaction. Finally a new era of tolerance and cultural integration started around 1773 and continued until 1961. The bicultural interaction persisted and a hybrid culture developed around cultural receptors. Conclusions: The history of Portuguese Goa is a natural experiment that allows us to examine the role played by cultural receptors in the adaptation to acculturative stress.

Abstract = {The present study examined the relations of minority stressors (i.e., experiences of prejudice, expectations of stigma, internalized biphobia, outness/concealment of bisexuality) as well as posited mental health promoters (i.e., bicultural self-efficacy, cognitive flexibility) with psychological distress and well-being in a sample of 411 bisexual people. Most of the minority stress variables were related positively with psychological distress and negatively with well-being, whereas the mental health-promoting variables were related negatively with psychological distress and positively with well-being. Results also indicated that expectations of stigma mediated the associations of antibisexual prejudice with greater distress and lower well-being, internalized biphobia was related directly with greater distress and lower well-being, and outness was linked with some costs and benefits. Moderated mediation analyses offered some evidence consistent with cognitive flexibility (but not bicultural self-efficacy) as a moderator. Specifically, within the mediation models, cognitive flexibility moderated the unique direct relation of antibisexual prejudice with psychological well-being, the relation of antibisexual prejudice with expectations of stigma, and the indirect relations of antibisexual prejudice with distress and well-being through the mediating role of expectations of stigma. These moderations were consistent with the expected buffering role of cognitive flexibility, but they also revealed that some of this buffering effect is exhausted in the context of high prejudice. Limitations of the study as well as implications for future research and practice with bisexual populations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Today’s diverse society often includes culturally rich environments that contain cues pertaining to more than one culture. These cultural cues can shape cognitive processes, such as creativity. Recent evidence shows that bicultural experience enhances creativity, and that for culture-related domains, this effect is particularly evident among biculturals who blend their two cultural identities. The present study tested whether enhanced creativity among more blended biculturals was due to increased idea generation (i.e., ideational fluency). Moreover, the authors tested whether these effects generalized to noncultural domains, which may indicate that bicultural experience enhances creativity in broader arenas. One hundred seventy-seven Chinese Americans completed a creativity task in either a monocultural or bicultural context (manipulated via Chinese or American symbols or both). Greater bicultural identity blendedness predicted domain-general creativity in bicultural but not in monocultural contexts, and this was mediated by ideational fluency. Implications for enhancing creativity in our diverse society are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: The objective of this article is to show that bicultural hybridization for the prevention of demoralization is anchored on the discovery of certain thematic areas (cultural receptors) in which social roles or cultural mandates are missing, unclear, ambiguous or congruent. Material: The specific setting is the history of Goa, a former Portuguese territory on the western coast of India. Both published and unpublished sources of information were studied. Discussion: Education, occupation and income, the three dimensions of social class, were less dominant than other aspects of the Hindu caste system, such as birth into a group viewed as a caste, observance of marriage circles, regulations of kinship and inheritance, and identification with a location. These other aspects were preserved as much as possible. The result was the conversion of the caste system into a system more akin to social class. Other examples of cultural receptors were found. Conclusions: A key step in the adaptation to acculturative stress is the discovery of cultural receptors in both cultures and the development of meaningful interconnections among those receptors. Psychotherapy attempts the restoration of morale. To be effective, therapists should consider the hierarchical organization of symbols and sentiments in the patient’s culture.

Abstract = {There is growing evidence of a high prevalence of domestic violence (DV) in Southeast Asian families living in the United States. Southeast Asian children and adolescents who witness DV are at great risk of developing psychological and behavioral problems. Despite these risks, many Southeast Asian youth show resilience and positive adaptation. Being bicultural has been associated with several positive outcomes among this population. This study hypothesized that Southeast Asian youth who have witnessed DV (n = 59) were less resilient than those who have not (n = 23). In addition, among those who have witnessed DV, bicultural youth were likely to be more resilient than highly Asian or highly westernized youth. This study used regression and t test analyses. The preliminary results confirmed both hypotheses. The conclusion of this study discussed clinical implications, limitations, and recommendations for future studies.

Abstract = {Objective: We applied the concept of naïve dialecticism (Peng & Nisbett, ), which characterizes East Asians' greater tendency to encompass contradictory, ever-changing, and interrelated features of an entity, to bicultural contexts and examined its effects on psychological well-being across various acculturating groups. Method: We administered questionnaire measures of the dialectical self, bicultural identity integration (BII; Benet-Martínez & Haritatos, 2005), and well-being to Hong Kong Chinese (N = 213) in Study 1 and Mainland Chinese (N = 239) in Study 2. In Study 3, a 4-week longitudinal study was conducted among Hong Kong Chinese (N = 173) to test the relationships of these variables over time. We then extended similar measures to new immigrants from Mainland China (N = 67) in Study 4 and Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong (N = 153) in Study 5. Results: Five studies converged to show that psychological adjustment was positively related to BII, but negatively related to the dialectical self. In Studies 1-3, dialecticism mediated the effect of BII on psychological adjustment among Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese bicultural individuals. Conclusions: Our findings reveal the deleterious effects of tolerance for contradiction on well-being and differentiate biculturalism patterns of immigration-based and globalization-based acculturation.

Abstract = {This study examined possible bicultural effects on creative potential of children in four groups of Chinese and French children in Hong Kong and Paris. An international battery of widely used divergent measures (Wallach-Kogan Creativity Tests; WKCT) and newly constructed divergent-plus-integrative measures (Evaluation of Potential Creativity; EPoC) was established for assessment. Study 1 showed that most measures of WKCT and EPoC were reasonably high in reliability and they had expected correlations with the fluency scores of some subtests of Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. Study 2 found some interestingly mixed bicultural effects favoring verbal divergent responses for French children and graphic integrative responses for Chinese children. Compared with Paris-French children, the bicultural Hong Kong-French children had significantly higher scores in figural fluency, figural flexibility, and figural uniqueness of WKCT (requiring only verbal divergent responses) but significantly lower scores in the graphic divergent-exploratory measure of EPoC. Compared with Hong Kong-Chinese children, the bicultural Paris-Chinese children had significantly higher scores in the graphic convergent-integrative measure of EPoC, but significantly lower scores in verbal fluency, verbal flexibility, figural fluency, figural flexibility, figural uniqueness, and figural unusualness of WKCT.

Abstract = {We apply latent class analysis (LCA) to build typologies of response profiles underlying variation in attitudes. LCA is directly suited for identifying categories of people who have distinct representational profiles, that is, discretely measureable patterns of attitudes that are bound together by a common system of interpretation used by the group to make sense of and communicate about a social object within a social context. This novel application extends social representations theory and provides a way to simultaneously examine the relevant content of important representations and their prevalence across a priori social categories and demographics within a given society. We identify four distinct representational profiles underlying bicultural policy attitudes in a nationally representative New Zealand sample (N = 6150). We map the prevalence of these four profiles across the population, show how they vary demographically across indicators of social class, immigration status, and ethnicity, and predict distinct patterns of voting behavior, political party support, social identification, and in-group and out-group attitudes. Guidelines for the use of LCA in the study of social representations are discussed, including a three-step model of the following: (i) profile prediction and derivation; (ii) profile validation; and (iii) prevalence mapping of profile distributions across strata within the population.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Ka Tū, Ka Oho: Visions of a Bicultural Partnership in Psychology. Invited Keynotes: Revisiting the Past to Reset the Future by Raymond Nairn et al. (Eds.). The context for this powerful new book arises, as you can see by the subtitle, from past invited keynote addresses to the New Zealand Psychological Society’s (NZPsS) annual conferences, engaging issues relevant to Māori and psychology and the bicultural imperative in Aotearoa New Zealand. It is possibly the first New Zealand book about psychology that could not just as easily have been written in Britain, the USA, Canada, or Australia. This is about us, and our psychology, and our struggles to make the discipline accessible and relevant to all. The editors, being less preposterous, have performed a skilful job of organizing the presentations into four major themes, the first is that colonization continues and affects all people. I would suggest that that is now well understood and accepted in our profession and so attention needs to turn to what psychology has to offer with respect to mitigating these negative effects. Some of the issues are handled less deftly in this book because fewer than half the contributors are actually psychologists. A good example of some limitation in understanding can be seen when authors tried to address the problems surrounding mental health services and the extent to which, as few would deny, organized mental health fails the Māori community.

One of the strategies used to promote access is the employment of bilingual/bicultural workers (sometimes referred to as multicultural, link or outreach workers). This study involved interviews with 24 bilingual/bicultural workers in south western Sydney, Australia to gain a better understanding of their role within the dementia field. Seven themes emerged: importance of working with family; process of building trust when moving between two cultures; importance of understanding the culture; self-care and culture; flexibility of their role; linking community members; and linking communities to mainstream services. Bilingual/bicultural workers play a significant and complex role in supporting individuals and families within their community who are affected by dementia. The significance of their role needs to be more clearly acknowledged in the development of policy, further research and service provision within the dementia field.

Abstract = {This study explored the anger-regulation strategies of bicultural individuals who are brought up with two distinct cultures that might carry contradictory demands about how to regulate emotions. With a sample of 525 adolescents in the Netherlands and Morocco, we found that bicultural Moroccan-Dutch adolescents' anger regulation in response to hypothetical peer conflict were largely similar to those of their Dutch peers. In fact, both the Dutch and the Moroccan-Dutch adolescents' anger regulation differed in the same ways from the Moroccan group, with greater acting out and less calm verbalisation, reflection, and diversion in the former than in the latter. Additionally, our findings indicate that Moroccan-Dutch adolescents' identification with the Dutch as well as with the Moroccan culture is related to more anger verbalisation and less externalising anger regulation. These results are interpreted in light of the complex cultural position faced by bicultural adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This study examined the moderating effects of acculturation modes (assimilated, integrated, and separated) on Hispanic consumers’ responses to three advertising targeting strategies (Caucasian targeted, bicultural, and Hispanic targeted). The hypotheses were empirically tested in a 3 × 3 factorial experiment with 155 self-identified Hispanic adult consumers, where their acculturation modes were measured and the advertising stimuli they viewed were manipulated. Based on the ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) test results, it was found that Hispanic consumers’ attitudes toward different targeted ads and their purchase intentions for the products promoted in the ads were significantly influenced by their acculturation modes. The study results also highlighted integrated Hispanic consumers’ dual identification with both mainstream society and their Hispanic heritage, and their preference for bicultural and bilingual ads.

Abstract = {The objectives of this research are to present certain adaptive strategies used by the members of a society when exposed to conflict and interaction with a different culture for decades or centuries and to demonstrate that the use of these strategies minimizes or prevents sociocultural disintegration and the resulting demoralization. The setting of the study is the Christianization and ‘westernization’ that took place from 1510 till around 1773 in three districts of Goa, a former Portuguese state on the western coast of India. Information on the history of Portuguese India was studied in the archives and libraries in Goa, the United States, Portugal and other European countries. Five adaptive strategies were used by Hindus who converted to Christianity, by Hindus who refused to convert and by Europeans, including Catholic missionaries, who were in charge of the conversions. They are called transformational mapping, privatization, individuation, cohesiveness and pragmatism. Examples of each strategy are given. By themselves or combined with each other, these adaptive strategies allowed the Goans to continue to function as a community, thereby preventing or minimizing sociocultural disintegration and the resulting demoralization. In the process, a vibrant hybrid culture was created and became a mark of distinction of Portuguese Goa. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In intercultural psychotherapeutic treatment, the psychological integration of different cultures within an individual has to be involved as an additional developmental dimension. Individual change during the process of migration considered as desirable adaptation has often been conceptualized in terms of a bicultural identity, which includes aspects of the culture of origin as well as aspects of the host culture. The theoretical foundation of the concept of bicultural identity, however, has remained insufficient. The culture-dynamic model presented here differentiates personal and social identity according to the identity concept proposed by Mead (Geist, Identität und Gesellschaft, 1988, Suhrkamp, Frankfurt a. M.). Personal identity is essentially formed by an individual’s culture of origin, while influences of the host culture primarily affect the social identity. For healthy coping with the challenges associated with migration and adequate support of this process in intercultural psychotherapy, it can be assumed that a stabilization of personal identity is required to allow for a dynamization of social identity. Implications for identity constitution in second generation immigrants, in different stages of lifespan development and in the process of learning the language of the host culture are discussed.

In the original article there was an error in correspondence.

Studies of judgment find that biculturals with less integrated identities (low BIIs) tend to defy salient cultural norms, whereas those with highly integrated identities (high BIIs) conform. This study examined biculturals' judgment in a group decision-making context, focusing on individuals' reactions to consensus in cultural ingroups. Results showed that low (vs. high) BIIs are more likely to resist the group consensus when it is incorrect, but not when it is correct. These findings suggest that contrarian impulses of low BIIs can be channeled towards facilitating constructive conflict resisting groupthink that results from cultural homogeneity.

In-depth interviews with 36 Modern-Orthodox Jewish men and women during their first year of marriage reveal unique considerations for mate selection and the dynamic flow between cultural systems. The findings show that dating is marriage-oriented but within a modern context. Although the study participants used modern tools and concepts, the marriage decision itself was bound to strict social norms and traditional expectations. The decision was based largely on rational reasoning, whereas love and personal needs were rarely discussed. The findings highlight the challenges faced by couples with bicultural identity in their transition to matrimony and can support professionals in addressing these conflicts.

Abstract = {Increasingly, individuals identify with two or more cultures. Prior research has found the degree to which individuals chronically integrate these identities (bicultural identity integration; BII) moderates responses to cultural cues: High BII individuals assimilate (adopting biases that are congruent with norms of the cued culture), whereas low BII individuals contrast (adopting biases that are incongruent with these norms). The authors propose BII can also be a psychological state and modulated by shifts in processing styles. In four experiments, the authors induced a global or local processing style using physical posture (Experiment 1) and cognitive manipulations (Experiments 2–4) and found that BII is enhanced in contexts facilitating a more global processing style (i.e., smiling, high-level construal, and similarity focus). The authors also found that contrastive responses to cultural cues are diminished when BII is situationally enhanced. Implications for research on processing style, identity integration, and performance in culture-based situations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {As the business world becomes more global many managers have spent significant time studying and working abroad. Does this overseas experience re-shape how managers think about the world? In this study we examined attribution patterns of Taiwanese managers who have studied and worked abroad. We found that managers who have been abroad switch their cultural orientation as a result of being shown Western or Chinese cultural icons, but this effect only occurs for those high in bicultural identity integration (BII). We confirmed that this effect occurs when “environmental” priming is used, and also confirmed that this effect is found when examining pay allocation decisions (a typical managerial issue) in addition to attribution patterns. These results point to the benefits of hiring internationally experienced managers, but also suggest that international experience may not be enough—companies need to also assess managers’ BII to know if foreign experience will truly translate into culturally appropriate cognitive flexibility.

In the present study, the authors empirically investigated a multidimensional conceptualization of acculturation using the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire–Short Version (BIQ-S; J. Szapocznik, W. M. Kurtines, & T. Fernandez, 1980). Baseline data from four prevention trials, representing a total of 893 adolescent and 880 guardian participants of Hispanic descent, were used to examine the factor structure of BIQ-S scores. Results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor solution. The factors were labeled as follows: (a) Comfort With Use of Spanish Language, (b) Comfort With Use of English Language, (c) Enjoyment of Hispanic Cultural Activities, and (d) Enjoyment of American Cultural Activities. The findings support an expansion of the theoretical conceptualization of biculturalism and suggest that within both the heritage and the receiving cultures, comfort with language and enjoyment of other cultural components represent different factors. Measurement invariance analyses revealed stability of the factor structure, as well as some measurement differences, between adolescents and their guardians.

Consistent with cross-cultural differences in autonomy ideals, South and East Asians were less motivated than Europeans to leave the family home. Cultural differences in moving out motivation were explained by East and South Asians having less parental approval for moving out before marriage and, additionally for South Asians, having a self-concept that is largely defined by the family (i.e., family allocentrism). Furthermore, the mediating effects of parental approval and family allocentrism were moderated by level of conflict within the family.

Abstract = {A commitment to partnership between indigenous Māori and the nonindigenous Pākehā provides a process for bicultural organizing in Aotearoa New Zealand. The authors introduce this partnership process to provide perspectives for teaching and learning about “closer encounters” between indigenous and nonindigenous people. The bicultural model the authors present derives from a specific response to a history of colonization, in which the Treaty of Waitangi (1840) is central. Forms of biculturalism derived from this treaty seek to share governance and to include both indigenous and nonindigenous cultural practices and knowledges. It is shown how material about indigenous peoples and their relationships with others can be written into the management curriculum by presenting examples of bicultural organizing. A theoretical framework is proposed, which analyses organizations in terms of “race relations played out in power struggles” and which uses the concept of “whiteness” to show how all organizational members are involved in these struggles. The authors introduce the “power struggles” of bicultural organizing through a discussion of two nursing organizations as examples of a commitment to a bicultural partnership model. They suggest further pedagogical resources for studying bicultural organizing in terms of two themes: governance and interview practices. These resources encourage educators to explore the new perspectives that a bicultural model can bring to familiar organizational behavior topics.

Abstract = {Given the growing numbers of bicultural individuals in the United States and around the world, bicultural identity integration (BII) is an important construct that helps researchers to better capture the diversity within this group. In this chapter, we organize and summarize the limited literature on individual differences in bicultural identity, with a special focus on BII. First, we discuss and define biculturalism and cultural identity in general. Second, we introduce individual differences in bicultural identity and the ways in which these differences have been studied. Third, we define BII, summarize research on this construct, and introduce the latest applications of BII theory to other areas of identity research. In unpacking the construct of BII, we first define it along with its components (harmony and blendedness) and nomological network. We also discuss what we believe to be the process involved in integrating one's dual cultural identities. We then present correlates of BII, including self-group personality perceptions, culturally related behaviors and values, and sociocultural and psychological adjustment. Finally, we discuss how BII relates to other important social-cognitive constructs, such as cultural frame switching or code switching. We end with a brief overview of the latest applications of BII theory (e.g., to gay identity) and suggestions for future research on bicultural identity. In summary, our goal for this chapter is to introduce BII and to help readers understand the importance of culture in identity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

The first section deals with the precursors (past and ongoing) to bicultural identity construction: personal characteristics, social structure, and bicultural identity negotiation strategies that continuously update the current construction of the individual's identity via situational salience of either the ethnic or mainstream identity or both. In the second section, we address possible identity negotiation outcomes, which can range from bicultural competence (acting appropriately and effectively in differing cultural environments) to identity ambivalence (the anxious feelings and/or distancing associated with incompletely connected cultural identities).

Abstract = {Understanding how ethnic identities develop in adolescence is currently limited by a reliance on self-report paper-and-pencil measures. This mixed-methods study presents a novel response time measure, the Multiethnic Identities Processing Task (MIPT), to quantify bicultural adolescents' implicit identifications with ethnic and racial identity labels. Eighty-four adolescents (age 14–21 years) of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds self-identified as bicultural or not bicultural and described their ethnic identities, pride, and ethnic centrality during a brief interview. Participants were assigned to complete either the interview (self-prime) or the MIPT (no prime) first. Results indicate that bicultural adolescents readily endorsed a variety of ethnic and racial labels in the MIPT, reflecting their multifaceted identities. Younger bicultural adolescents showed a large inhibited response to the label “White,” indicating some hesitation in deciding whether the label was “like me” or “not like me.” Heart rate monitoring and qualitative analyses of interviews provide some insight into this pattern of results. Findings are discussed with respect to developmental theory, and the strengths of using both implicit and explicit measures to understand multiethnic identity development in adolescence.

Results from 761 bilingual university students show that biculturals with strong Chinese and Western selves are psychologically more integrated than others with weaker selves. They are the only group to strongly endorse multiple social identities as Chinese, Hongkonger, and Hongkong Chinese.

Abstract = {Bicultural individuals vary in the degree to which their two cultural identities are integrated. Among Asian-Americans, for instance, some experience their Asian and American sides as compatible whereas others experience them as conflicting. Past research on judgments finds this individual difference affects the way bicultural individuals respond to situations that cue their cultures. Asian-Americans with high bicultural identity integration (BII) assimilate to norms of the cued culture (e.g., they exhibit typically American judgments when in situations that cue American culture), whereas Asian-Americans with low BII do the opposite, contrasting against the cue (e.g., they exhibit typically Asian judgments when in American situations). We investigated whether this dynamic similarly affects creative performance, which differs cross-culturally in that novelty is encouraged more by American than East Asian norms. In two experiments, we found that cues to American (vs. Asian) culture increase the novelty of solutions in divergent thinking tasks for Asian-Americans with high BII (assimilative response) yet decrease it for Asian-Americans with low BII (contrastive response). We discuss theoretical implications for culture and creativity research and practical implications for firms seeking to foster creativity.

Abstract = {This study investigates the link between motivational and affective experiences in the daily life of bicultural individuals. Employing a diary design, the authors examined the role of cultural identification in the dynamic goal–affect association in East-Asian Canadian biculturals. Using multilevel modeling procedures, the authors found that momentary cultural identification systematically moderated the association between extrinsic motivation and Negative Affect (NA) over time. Similar to previous findings observed from monocultural Westerners, biculturals in this study showed a positive association between extrinsic motivation and NA when they identified with Western culture. When they identified with Asian culture, however, biculturals' extrinsic motivation was not linked to NA, suggesting that when their Asian identity is salient, they are less negatively influenced by extrinsic goal pursuit than when they identified with Western culture. Findings indicate the importance of within-individual short-term variations in cultural identification for understanding the affective implications of extrinsic motivation in the lives of bicultural individuals.

Abstract = {Traditional studies of ethnic relations focus on racialization between Whites and Blacks, or ethnic stratification between Whites and people of color. This study aims at broadening conventional studies of interethnic relations to examine racial attitudes among people who have internalized more than one culture—i.e., the biculturals and multiculturals. Social psychological research suggests that bicultural individuals are capable of switching between two cultural meaning frames depending on contextual demands. Bicultural individuals vary in how well they integrate the two cultural identities internalized in them—i.e., their bicultural identity integration levels (BII levels). Their BII levels lead to either culturally congruent or culturally incongruent behaviors among bicultural individuals. The underlying assumption of linguistic intergroup bias indicates that people tend to describe more abstractly observed positive ingroup behaviors and negative outgroup behaviors and describe more concretely observed negative ingroup behaviors and positive outgroup behaviors. In this study, bicultural Asian American participants are hypothesized to use language of either higher or lower abstraction to describe actions of positive and negative valence performed by either ethnic Asians or European Americans depending on the cultural priming they received and their BII levels. The demonstrated pattern of ingroup enhancement and outgroup derogation of the bicultural participants point out the perceived ingroup/outgroup orientation of these biculturals towards their coethnics and people of the mainstream culture. Effects of the cultural priming and impact of BII levels are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This paper explores how middle-class Taiwanese immigrant mothers in the United States defined the benefits of placing their children in predominantly White American childcare centers instead of using more culturally familiar forms of care. From in-depth interviews with seven Taiwanese immigrant mothers, it was learned that they viewed these settings positively, even though their children were not in cultural environments that mirrored their homes and ethnic communities. Mothers explained that they purposefully chose this type of setting because 1) they desired to develop their children's social competency in U.S. society; 2) they perceived U.S. childcare settings as multicultural and accepting of diverse cultures even if they were in the minority; and 3) they were confident that their children's participation in their own Taiwanese ethnic community would ensure the maintenance of their children's ethnic identity and knowledge of their parents' culture. For these reasons, they did not seek out race matching or cultural congruity between childcare centers and their homes. Instead, mothers viewed the childcare center as part of their overall socialization strategy for developing their children's bicultural competency in both their heritage culture as well as U.S. society.

Yet what is termed assessment in psychology takes many forms, and it intersects with everyday life and culture in a number of ways. This position paper considers some of these issues, stressing the importance of unpacking the assessment process in the light of culture and lived experience, and then advocates a framework that promotes the blending clinical and cultural knowledge within the process of psychological assessment. The framework is offered as an example of how culture may intersect with psychological assessment where practice or research involves Māori individuals and families, but can be generalised to other cultural settings and situations.

Results from two studies show that subjective cultural identity and situational cultural cues had different relationships with body ideals. Among Asian-American women, identification with Asian culture was related to a thinner body ideal, but exposure to Asian cultural cues (relative to American cultural cues) was related to a thicker body ideal. Among Black-American women, identification with Black culture was related to a thicker body ideal, but exposure to Black cultural cues (relative to American cultural cues) was related to a thinner body ideal.

In addition to observing these preservice teachers in their courses and conducting interviews, the researchers also analyzed the teaching practices of their bilingual-bicultural professors. Findings indicate that bilingual teacher candidates need to have space and support for reflecting upon the conflicting meanings they might ascribe to experiences and insights gained through the occupation of different identity positions.

Thirteen Asian American young adults (ages 18–29) participated in qualitative interviews regarding their personal experiences of self-construal in different cultural contexts. Two qualitative approaches to data collection were used including inductive, open-ended interviewing and a more deductive approach in which participants were shown conceptual models of the self and then were asked to talk about their experiences in relation to the models. Participants' stories and meanings of self support previous theory, which conceptualizes self-construals as primarily cultural constructs. However, for these bicultural Asian Americans, self-construal was also described as a co-constructed process strongly influenced by racial dynamics in the United States. Implications for a shift in conceptualization of self are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Participants were 167 Asian American, African American, and Latino/a American students at a predominantly White Midwest university. Results from a hierarchical regression analysis suggested that (a) minority stress was positively associated with depressive symptoms after controlling for perceived general stress, (b) PBC was negatively associated with depressive symptoms after controlling for perceived general stress and minority stress, and (c) the interaction between minority stress and PBC was significant in predicting depressive symptoms. Results from a simple effect analysis supported the hypothesis that a higher level of PBC buffers the association between minority stress and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, post hoc exploratory analyses of the components of PBC suggested that 2 components, Social Groundedness and Cultural Knowledge, may be especially important coping resources.

This article presents a case study with a narrative approach, aiming to illustrate how an occupational therapy intervention can highlight the role of culture and address bicultural identification in a young adult immigrant woman with mental health problems. The results show how a culturally adapted intervention model can be used to help the client go through a transition from an interdependent to a more independent self. During the course of occupational therapy, the client gained greater insight into her problems and could view herself as integrating numerous facets related to two different social and cultural contexts. Moreover, the client achieved better skills in dealing with discrepancies and cultural contradictions and became capable of relying on either or both of the cultures in different situations.

Their innate skills that result from being bicultural may help solve central problems in multicultural teams, including managing conflicts and boundary spanning across cultures.

Results showed that Asian-Americans with high BII gave less weight to employees’ situational conditions in the American setting (matching American cultural norms) and more weight in the Asian setting (matching Asian cultural norms), whereas those with low BII showed the opposite pattern, giving more weight to employees’ situational conditions in the American setting (mismatching American cultural norms) and less weight in the Asian setting (mismatching Asian cultural norms).

Conceptualizing race as an ascribed extended kinship network and using notions of "groundedness" from bicultural identity literature, the relational aspects of participants’ identity development are highlighted.

Abstract = {This study examined cultural values as resources for South Korean students' adjustment to college. Both collectivistic and individualistic values were hypothesized to be important for South Korean students for continued harmonious relationships with their family, as well as adjustment to the new college environment. Survey data from 173 male and 88 female students included measures of cultural values (collectivism and individualism), academic and social college adjustment, and selfesteem (as an indicator of satisfaction with ones' values choices). Collectivistic values were positively associated with academic adjustment and self-esteem for both men and women, and with social adjustment for women, but not men. Individualism was positively correlated with academic adjustment and self-esteem for men, but not women. Multiple regression analyses suggested the bicultural values hypothesis was not supported for women, and supported for men with regard to positive self-esteem. Adopting a mixture of individualistic and collectivistic values is discussed as part of a larger process of acquiring bicultural competence that may be necessary for success in increasingly Western-oriented Korean universities.

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how bicultural consumers differ from monocultural consumers in terms of personality traits and identity negotiation. Design/methodology/approach - Through a multidisciplinary literature review, some anecdotally and qualitatively supported differences between biculturals and monoculturals are reviewed and formulated as hypotheses, and a survey is used to collect quantitative data from a mixed random-purposeful sample. Findings - Relative to monoculturals, biculturals exhibit greater concern about their acceptability within pertinent reference groups and society at large; have comparable levels of need for uniqueness and art enthusiasm; and consume more artwork as a means and in the process of their routine negotiation of (ethnic) identity. Ethnicity, need for social acceptability, need for group identification, and art enthusiasm are predictors of artwork consumption. Ethnicity, in particular, is a key precursor of artwork consumption. Research limitations/implications - As a starting-point for understanding the bicultural consumer, the study is subject to exploratory research limitations. Originality/value - As partial manifestations of globalization, businesses are challenged today in several ways by the rise and proliferation of the bicultural neotribe. Businesses do not have to fall victim to these challenges; they can turn them around and strategically leverage them as marketplace opportunities. The study provides some early insights that can help businesses to leverage such opportunities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Empathy is essential for healthy relationships and overall well-being. Affective empathy is the emotional response to others' distress and can take two forms: personal distress or empathic concern. In Western cultures, high empathic concern and low personal distress have been implicated in increased prosocial behaviour (e.g., Eisenberg et al., 1989) and better emotion management and peer relations (e.g., Eisenberg and Fabes, 1998). Various factors have been examined with respect to affective empathy, but the role of culture has received little attention. Previous work suggests that children from East Asian cultures compared to those from Western cultures experience greater personal distress and less empathic concern (e.g., Trommsdorff, 1995), but no work has specifically examined these differences in adolescents or individuals who identify as 'bicultural'. The current research examines cultural differences in affective empathy using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1980) in an adolescent and young adult sample (n = 190) and examines how empathy relates to social-emotional health in bicultural individuals. Consistent with research on children, East Asian adolescents reported greater personal distress and less empathic concern than their Western counterparts. The bicultural individuals' scores fell in between the East Asian and Western groups, but revealed significant differences from their 'uni-cultural' peers, demonstrating shared influences of community and family. Importantly, however, the relationship between affective empathy and social-emotional health in bicultural individuals was the same as for Western individuals. The current results provide an important first step in understanding the different cultural influences on empathic responding in a previously understudied population—bicultural individuals.

Abstract = {Purpose: The paper's aim is to explore how bicultural consumers differ from monocultural consumers, and among themselves, in terms of country-of-origin effect and ethnocentrism. Design/methodology/approach: A multidisciplinary literature review pointed to a set of hypotheses regarding the differences between biculturals (Mexican Americans) and monoculturals (Mexicans and Americans), and between bicultural groups (integrating biculturals versus alternating biculturals). Two pilot tests and two experiments were conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings: Bicultural Mexican Americans are less ethnocentric than either American or Mexican monoculturals; exhibit more favorable quality evaluation and purchase intention toward American brands than Mexican monoculturals; and exhibit more favorable quality evaluation and purchase intention toward Mexican brands than American monoculturals. Although ethnocentrism does not significantly demarcate alternating biculturals from their integrating counterparts, alternators are more likely than integrators to provide a favorable evaluation of foreign brands and entertain the intention to purchase them. Research limitations/implications: As a starting-point for understanding the bicultural consumer, this study is subject to exploratory research limitations. Originality/value: The country-of-origin literature implicitly assumes that consumers identify with either the country where the product is originated or the country where it is sold. This assumption, however, might not hold for ethnic groups who identify with both countries. Such bicultural consumers might identify with the product's origin country as well as target country and, therefore, be less amenable to the country-of-origin hypothesis. We address this important research gap. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The experience of a calling may be seen as the ultimate form of subjective career success that has many positive consequences for individuals and organizations. We are here concerned with the conceptualization of a new multidimensional measure of calling, the MCM. In the first two studies we employed a qualitative approach and came up with five core categories of the experience of a calling. Three of them could be empirically distinguished in our later quantitative studies, i.e., Identification & Person-Environment-Fit (IP), Transcendent Guiding Force (TGF), and Sense and Meaning & Value-Driven-Behavior (SMVB). We tested the reliability and validity of the MCM in two different countries (Germany and USA). Our data show that whereas TGF is most closely related to a direct calling measure, IP is more strongly related to job satisfaction. Both IP and TGF seem to have a buffering function against burnout. SMVB is endorsed most in the USA, whereas IP is endorsed most in Germany. We conclude that a multidimensional conceptualization seems appropriate in studying the experience of a calling and its consequences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Theory and empirical research suggest that perceived self-efficacy, or one's perceived ability to perform personally significant tasks, is related to individuals' psychological well-being and mental health. Thus, the authors hypothesized that bicultural individuals' perceived ability to function competently in 2 cultures, or perceived bicultural self-efficacy, would be related positively to their psychological well-being and mental health. Three studies were conducted to develop and validate a measure of perceived bicultural self-efficacy and to explore its relationships with indices of psychological well-being and mental health. Exploratory (n = 268) and confirmatory (n = 164) factor analyses on the theoretically derived Bicultural Self-Efficacy Scale (BSES) items support a measurement model that taps into the 6 dimensions of bicultural competence proposed by T. LaFromboise, H. L. K. Coleman, and J. Gerton (1993). Furthermore, initial evidence for internal consistency (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and test–retest reliability (n = 51 Asian Americans) for each of the 6 subscales were found. Finally, perceived bicultural self-efficacy was found to be related to bicultural college students' psychological well-being and mental health. Research implications of the perceived bicultural self-efficacy construct and the potential utility of the BSES as a multidimensional measure of the construct are discussed.

Abstract = {The development and bicultural validation of the New Sexual Satisfaction Scale (NSSS)—a 20 item, multidimensional, composite measure of sexual satisfaction—is presented. The development of the scale was based on a five-dimension, conceptual model that emphasized the importance of multiple domains of sexual behavior including sexual sensations, sexual awareness and focus, sexual exchange, emotional closeness, and sexual activity. Scale construction and validation were carried out using seven independent samples with over 2,000 participants aged 18 to 55 in Croatia and the United States. Primary data collection was completed using online survey tools. Analyses did not confirm the proposed conceptual framework but suggested a two-dimensional structure focusing on self (“ego-centered”) and the other (a “partner- and sexual activity-centered” factor) domains, each containing items representing all five conceptual dimensions. Scale reliability (k = 20) was satisfactory for all samples, and construct validity was confirmed in both cultures. The NSSS was also found to have acceptable one-month stability. It is suggested that the NSSS may be a useful tool for assessing sexual satisfaction regardless of a person's gender, sexual orientation, and relationship status.

Abstract = {This paper proposes a Y-shaped model of the developmental stages for the Chinese bicultural self. The authors slightly modified Jane Loevinger’s (1976, 1983) six stage model of ego development to form a five stage one for the ontogenetic development of the individual oriented self. The five stages are preconformity stage, conformity stage, individualistically conscientious stage, autonomous stage and individualistically integrated stage. The earliest two stages are identical in the two five-stage models, whereas the later three in one model are diametrically different, in one way or another, from the corresponding ones in the other. It is thus possible to place the early two stages on the stem of the Y-form layout. Beyond the intersection point, the later three successive stages for the social-oriented self are placed on the left arm, and the corresponding three for the individual-oriented self on the right one. The defining psychological (cognitive, motivational, affectional, and intentional) and behavioral characteristics of such a self are described for each stage on the stem and the two arms, so that the empirical test of this Y-form developmental model of the Chinese self could be made feasible.

Abstract = {Cross-cultural management research suggests that bicultural-bilinguals are ideal cultural mediators as they are able to access dual cultural frameworks and seamlessly switch back and forth between these. The assumption is that this switching between cultural frameworks ensures equivalency in meaning across cultures. Yet previous research has only shown this effect at a between-subject level during which cultural variables were not controlled for. Our research controls for such influences by relying on a within-subject approach, illustrating that language triggers frame switching among bicultural-bilinguals and that the process is largely tacit. Moreover, such frame switching may lead to unintended consequences for organizations seeking to control a meaning across cultures as the meaning in the original language is uprooted to a point where it may no longer be recognizable within a different language. We illustrate this drift in meaning across both concrete and abstract concepts and discuss its managerial implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Grounded in the cognitive framework of processing fluency, this study proposes further support for the experiential perspective in aesthetics by positing that aesthetic response to the same object may be malleable, depending on how the symbolic properties of the object interact with different cultural contexts which either facilitate or debilitate the processing experience of the perceiver. The study employed an Internet experiment to test the hypotheses among 105 female Hispanic college-aged students enrolled at a large midwestern university. The findings revealed that symbolic attributes of products interact with cultural contexts to affect aesthetic judgments of (Hispanic) consumers. Aesthetic judgments were more positive when evaluating culturally symbolic product attributes after exposure to congruent contextual cues that facilitate fluent processing. The study furnishes support for the impact of environment/context on consumer behavior and aesthetic judgment, thus establishing further support for the cognitive framework of conceptual fluency in explaining aesthetic response. The study also contributes to recent literature on "frame-switching" among bicultural consumers by suggesting that these consumers navigate between competing cultural frames in response to visual primes, with resultant shifts in aesthetic judgments. Important marketing insights emerge from these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Cultural identity is central to health. Acculturation may be formulated with a bicultural model, assessing in parallel the degree of identification with both the original and the host culture. The Cortes, Rogler and Malgady Bicultural Scale (CRM-BS) is composed of two subscales: “original” culture and “mainstream-United States” (US) culture. It was modified into three ethnic versions: Latino, Korean and Chinese. Validation of the CRM-BS was conducted using health professionals and psychiatric patients from the above three ethnic groups and a control sample of mainstream-US (main-US) health professionals in New York City (n = 394). Mean time of completion was 3.7 min and 73% judged it to be easy to use. Strong test–retest reliability correlation coefficients were found (original culture, 0.78; mainstream-US, 0.82). The internal consistency was documented by high Cronbach’s alpha values (original culture, 0.88; mainstream-US, 0.80). Factorial analysis revealed two factors, the first one involving all the items of the original culture and the second all of the mainstream-US items. Concerning its discriminant validity, non-main-US subjects scored significantly higher than main-US subjects on the original culture subscale, and vice versa. Construct validity was assessed comparing intergenerational mean scores on both subscales; as generations become older, mean scores for the original culture decreased, while those for the “host” culture increased. Results for each specific ethnic version are also presented. Cutoff scores were calculated to categorize the involvement with the original culture or the host culture, both of them, or neither.

Abstract = {Bicultural individuals vary in the degree to which their two cultural identities are integrated versus conflicting—Bicultural Identity Integration (BII). Past research on attribution biases finds that BII influences the way that biculturals shift in response to cultural primes: integrated biculturals shift assimilatively, whereas conflicted biculturals shift contrastively. Proposing that this reflects assimilation versus reactance responses, we tested whether it extends to shifts in self-perceived personality. In two experiments with Asian–American participants, we found that BII influences the direction of cultural priming effects (assimilation versus contrast) on the personality dimensions of need for uniqueness (Experiment 1) and extraversion (Experiment 2). As hypothesized, high BIIs shifted in a culturally assimilative direction, perceiving the self as more uniqueness-seeking and extraverted following American versus Asian priming, whereas low BIIs shifted in the reverse direction. Implications for research on bicultural identity, priming, personality, organizational and consumer behavior are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This research tests the theoretical prediction that the self-concept of bicultural Chinese would become more socially connected when Chinese primed than when Western primed. Measures of social connectedness are derived from the Self-Reference Effect, according to which information will be memorized better when it references the Self than when it references the non- Self. Under Western priming (n = 91), memory of information referencing Self is better than that referencing font (a non person condition referring to the style in which the information is printed), a Non identified Person (NIP), or Mother, which suggests a relatively distinct Self (Hypothesis 1). Under Chinese priming (n = 96), the Self-font distinction remains, but the Self–NIP and Self–Mother distinctions disappear as predicted, suggesting a more socially connected Self (Hypothesis 2). The predicted Priming × Referencing interaction effects are (marginally) significant, which confirm that the Self–NIP and Self–Mother connectedness is higher under Chinese priming than under Western priming (Hypothesis 3).

Abstract = {Adopting a dynamic constructivist approach to culture (Hong and Chiu 2001), this project examined the effect of advertising appeals in activating self-construals among Chinese Generation X consumers. In Study 1, the bicultural disposition of this generation was evident when its salient self-construals were found to shift toward independence or interdependence in response to individualistic versus collectivistic advertisements. Study 2 demonstrated further that this self-shifting effect emerged only among bicultural Generation X individuals. Specifically, compared to when exposed to collectivistic ads, when exposed to individualistic ads, low biculturals (low in both individualistic and collectivistic orientation measures) responded with more independent self-construals, whereas high biculturals (high in both orientation measures) responded with more interdependent self-construals. Overall, these results are consistent with the theoretical expectation about the impact of globalization on biculturalism. Moreover, the results also reveal new knowledge about the role that contemporary advertising in China plays in promoting cultural changes at the individual level.

The present authors extended this primarily qualitative research on the bicultural experience by adopting the social identity perspective (H. Tajfel & J. C. Turner, 1986). They developed and tested an empirically testable model of the role of cultural construals, in-group prototypicality, and identity in bicultural conflict in 2 studies with 2nd-generation Asian Canadians. In both studies, the authors expected and found that participants' construals of their 2 cultures as different predicted lower levels of simultaneous identification with both cultures. Furthermore, the authors found this relation was mediated by participants' feelings of prototypicality as members of both groups. Although the perception of cultural difference did not predict well-being as consistently and directly as the authors expected, levels of simultaneous identification did show these relations.

Abstract = {Objective: This study was designed to examine, with the use of Berry's acculturation concept (2003), personal self-esteem and collective esteem in the acculturation of young Turks in Germany. Further, it was aimed to examine whether ethnic identity is linked to better mental health. Method: Consecutive psychiatric primary care patients with Turkish background were screened with the 5-item Acculturation Questionnaire, adopted from the Latin American Validated Acculturation Scale. The interviewed patients were also assessed for psychiatric disorders according to ICD-10. Results: By using the acculturation questionnaire among 220 patients included to this study, 154 (70%) patients, (88 male-57.14%, mean age: 22.1 sd. ± 3.26 and 66 female-42.85%, mean age: 21.73 sd. ± 1,19) were found to be relatively good adjusted (group 1), and of 66 (30%) patients (44 male-66.6%, mean age: 26.3 sd. ± 3.39 and 22 female-33.3%, mean age:25.88 sd. ± 3,41) were found to be relatively poor adjusted (group 2) to the host community. The psychiatric co-morbidity showed in these two groups two distinct patterns (p < 0.001). Endogenous depression and the depression caused by the conflicts in the family-milieu are significantly more common in the group I. Unlike, the depression triggered by the psycho-social maladjustment is clearly more prevalent in the group II. The predictors of good adaptation were shown to be: bilingualism, bicultural identity and Germany as country of birth, whereas poor adaptation was related to: dominance of ethnic culture and language, and being born outside of Germany. Conclusion: The research presented provides firm evidence for a bicultural identity through assessments of several domains of acculturation: language spoken most of the time, language thought, ethnic identity, birthplace and the degree of adjustment to the host community. Cultural identity is one of the key determinants of mental health in evaluating adaptation to the host culture among immigrants. It is vital for the mental health professionals to understand the roles, context, and therapeutic consequences that originate from culture.

Abstract = {Where in the brain are the self and significant others (e.g. mother) represented? Neuroscientists have traced self-representation to the ventral medial prefrontal cortex for both Westerners and East Asians. However, significant others were represented alongside the self in the same brain area for East Asians but not for Westerners. In this experiment, Westernized bicultural Chinese were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing trait judgments that referenced the self, mother, or a non-identified person (NIP) after Western or Chinese culture priming. Consistent with Western independent self-construals and Chinese interdependent self-construals, Western priming increased, whereas Chinese priming decreased the neural differentiation of mother and NIP from self.

Abstract = {In two samples of Latino biculturals, we examined the link between bicultural identity integration (BII; degree of compatibility vs. opposition perceived between ethnic and mainstream cultural orientations; Benet-Martinez & Haritatos, 2005) and the psychological overlap/distance between the personality traits ascribed to the self, a typical Latino, and a typical Anglo American. As predicted, BII's component of blendedness (vs. distance) was consistently and positively associated with higher overlap between personality ratings of the self and a typical Latino, the self and a typical Anglo American, and a typical Latino and a typical Anglo American. Also as predicted, results with BII's component of harmony (vs. conflict) were not robust. Overall, our results suggest that biculturals with integrated cultural identities have social perceptions of themselves and their cultural in-groups that are closely aligned together, supporting social identity theory.

Abstract = {Workers’ attitudes concerning the competition for individual’s resources between work and family are expressed by the relative centrality they attribute to each of these domains. This competition is also manifested in the tradeoff between work and family time. The study deals with 319 Israeli high-tech workers. We examined the effect of parenthood on men and on women regarding the centrality of and investment in work and family in the bicultural context of the Israeli high-tech industry (i.e., the family-centered Israeli society on the one hand, and the masculine work-centered high-tech industry on the other hand). A contrasting parenthood effect on men and women was found. Fathers showed higher relative work centrality than childless men, whereas mothers showed lower relative work centrality than women without children. Fathers invested more weekly hours in paid work than childless men, whereas mothers invested fewer weekly hours in paid work than women without children. In the parents’ sub-sample, mothers evinced higher relative family centrality than fathers. Mothers also invested more weekly hours in childcare and core housework tasks than fathers. The uniqueness of the findings is that the contrasting parenthood effect prevails even in the demanding high-tech sector, in which women are expected to work long hours and play down their care-giving activities. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that mothers struggled to juggle active family caring with a career, rather than give up either of them. We also found that mothers invested more weekly hours in work in general (paid and unpaid work) than fathers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Longitudinal studies have shown how early developmental contexts contribute significantly to self-development; their influence extends through adulthood, informs sociality, and affects resilience under severe stress. While the importance of sociality in trauma recovery is recognized, the relationship between developmental and posttrauma contexts and recovery effects is less appreciated, particularly in cases in which recovery contexts differ widely from the culture of origin. Using an attachment-based model of bicultural (competence in two cultures) development, the authors examined the role of self in posttrauma repair of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) who had been differentially reared by humans during neuroethologically formative periods and subsequently used as biomedical subjects. Results show that variations in posttrauma schema correlate with early socialization patterns. Self-resilience supports, but also may constrain, recovery depending on the compatibility of internal self models with recovery resources. Trauma severity notwithstanding, the cultural context of origin emerges as a critical factor in designing effective therapeutic intervention and assessments in primates, humans inclusive. Finally, the results underscore the ethical implications for the practices of cross-fostering nonhuman primates and their use in research.

Abstract = {How do Mexican immigrant adolescents balance different, and often oppositional, cultural influences in the acculturation process? In this article, we explore how acculturating adolescents absorb cultural messages and go about creating their (multiple) identities. Guided by Alternation Theory, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 undocumented Mexican adolescents and 14 of their parents who had immigrated to North Carolina within the past 7 years. All of the families had adolescent children who were born in Mexico. At least one parent and one adolescent from each family were interviewed. Interviewing multiple family members allowed us to examine how bicultural development progressed differently for various family members, and how the whole family balanced between cultural systems. Mexican parents and adolescents were acculturating while trying to resist assimilation pressures. They maintained strong Mexican identities that were preserved by practicing Mexican customs, values, and traditions in their homes and churches. Meeting U.S. cultural and linguistic demands at work and in school placed Mexican parents and adolescents between the two cultural systems. This prompted adolescents and parents to integrate some U.S. customs, language, or social behaviors into their daily lives, increasing bilingualism and, in some cases, biculturalism.

Abstract = {Recent work on biculturalism has made theoretical and methodological inroads into our understanding of the relation of cultural processes with psychological functioning. Through the use of cultural priming methodologies, investigators have demonstrated that biculturals, or individuals who have experienced and identify with more than one culture, can switch between various "cultural frames of reference" in response to corresponding social cues (Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martinez, 2000). Drawing on this work on the cognitive implications of biculturalism, the purpose of the present study was to examine the assumption that independent and interdependent self-construals are associated with the motivational standards of self-enhancement and self-criticism, respectively. More specifically, the effects of differential primes of self on ratings of self-enhancement were investigated in a sample of bicultural Asian American (N = 42) and Anglo American (N = 60) college students; overall, more similarities than differences were noted between the two groups. It was hypothesized that Anglo American students would display marked tendencies toward self-enhancement. However, this hypothesis was not supported. Nevertheless, consistent prime effects were observed for a selected number of ratings related to academic virtues, with those who received an independent-self prime often exhibiting greater self-enhancing tendencies than those who received an interdependent-self prime. For example, participants in the independent-self condition reported on average significantly higher ratings for self-discipline and initiative, as well as the degree to which they perceived themselves to be hard working. Implications for the work on self-representations, motivation, and acculturation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Children interviewed in English provided more elaborate and self-focused self-descriptions and memory accounts and endorsed more strongly Western values, compared with children interviewed in Chinese. Furthermore, the endorsement of a cultural belief system mediated the effect of language on self-concept, which, in turn, mediated the effect of language on autobiographical memory.

Our studies targeted three distinct types of biculturals: Mainland Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong, Filipino domestic workers (i.e., sojourners) in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese college students. Individual differences in Bicultural Identity Integration (BII; Benet-Martínez, Leu, Lee, & Morris, 2002) positively predicted psychological adjustment for all the samples except sojourners even after controlling for the personality traits of neuroticism and self-efficacy. Cultural identification and language abilities also predicted adjustment, although these associations varied across the samples in meaningful ways. We concluded that, in the process of managing multiple cultural environments and group loyalties, bilingual competence, and perceiving one's two cultural identities as integrated are important antecedents of beneficial psychological outcomes.

The social orientation is rooted in traditional Chinese conceptualization of the self, whereas the individual orientation has evolved and developed under Western influences along with recent societal modernization. The author conducted a series of 5 studies to test the theory and relate the model to important issues in current personality and social psychological research, such as cultural individualism-collectivism, self-construals, motivation, cognition, emotion, and well-being. A total of 977 university students in Taiwan participated. The author found that contrasting self-aspects were differentially associated with the aforementioned constructs, as theoretically predicted.

Morris (Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 2010[Nov], Vol 46[6], 1114-1117). In the original article there was an error in correspondence. The correct correspondence is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2010-15126-001[/rid]). Bicultural individuals differ in the degree to which their cultural identities are integrated versus conflicting Bicultural Identity Integration (BII). Studies of judgment find that biculturals with less integrated identities (low BIIs) tend to defy salient cultural norms, whereas those with highly integrated identities (high BIIs) conform. This study examined biculturals' judgment in a group decision-making context, focusing on individuals' reactions to consensus in cultural ingroups. Results showed that low (vs. high) BIIs are more likely to resist the group consensus when it is incorrect, but not when it is correct. These findings suggest that contrarian impulses of low BIIs can be channeled towards facilitating constructive conflict resisting groupthink that results from cultural homogeneity. Implications for bicultural identity, motives, and organizational behavior are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objectives: The study examined the relation between adolescent risk behaviors and bicultural stress due to discrimination, immigration, and acculturation factors. We hypothesized bicultural stress would be related to increased risk behavior and depressive symptoms independent of socioeconomic status, ethnic self-identification, and acculturation. Design: Middle school student participants (n = 519; median age 14) completed a self-report questionnaire on their risk behaviors, psychosocial antecedents, and sociodemographic factors. Latino (304) and non-Latino European American (215) students were surveyed through a large, urban, West Coast US school district. Results: More bicultural stress was significantly related to reports of all risk behaviors (i.e. smoking, drinking, drug use, and violence) and depressive symptoms. Further, bicultural stress was a robust explanatory variable across sub-groups, and appears largely independent from depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The hypotheses were supported. Bicultural stress appears to be an important underlying factor for health disparities among US adolescents. Future research may consider promoting well-being in majority, as well as minority adolescents, through targeting sources of bicultural stressors or examining ways to moderate their effects on adolescent risk behaviors.

Abstract = {The paper examines cultural frame-switching among bicultural participants at the level of associated meanings. Bicultural participants of Greek descent who live in the Netherlands were randomly primed with either Greek or Dutch cultural symbols and language. A monocultural Dutch group in the Netherlands and a monocultural Greek group in Greece, were involved as control groups. Structural equation modeling indicated that the Greek participants in Greece and the bicultural participants primed with Greek culture had a similar pattern of associations. This pattern differed from that of the Dutch participants and the participants primed with Dutch culture. Thus, the two different monocultural association patterns were replicated among bicultural individuals. The findings show that meanings are affected by cultural frame-switching, and provide further support for the dynamic constructivist approach.

Abstract = {Speaking the language of one's origin has symbolic importance for maintaining one's ethnic group identity. This study investigates the following question: How does a bicultural identity evolve as Chinese American children grow from the period of adolescence to young adulthood? By conducting in-depth interviews of 10 adolescents and 10 young adults, this study examines the perceived benefits and costs of bilingualism in second-generation Chinese American children who are between 12 and 20 years old. This study illustrates the mixed feelings that these young people experience as they grow from adolescence to young adulthood. These feelings include confusion, uncertainty, pride, and self-affirmation. Specifically, this study finds that young adults, as compared with adolescents, show an increased intrinsic motivation to retain a bicultural identity as they grow older; hence, they perceive the benefits to be greater than the costs in bilingualism and biculturalism.

Abstract = {In the present study, the authors empirically investigated a multidimensional conceptualization of acculturation using the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire–Short Version (BIQ-S; J. Szapocznik, W. M. Kurtines, & T. Fernandez, 1980). Baseline data from four prevention trials, representing a total of 893 adolescent and 880 guardian participants of Hispanic descent, were used to examine the factor structure of BIQ-S scores. Results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor solution. The factors were labeled as follows: (a) Comfort With Use of Spanish Language, (b) Comfort With Use of English Language, (c) Enjoyment of Hispanic Cultural Activities, and (d) Enjoyment of American Cultural Activities. The findings support an expansion of the theoretical conceptualization of biculturalism and suggest that within both the heritage and the receiving cultures, comfort with language and enjoyment of other cultural components represent different factors. Measurement invariance analyses revealed stability of the factor structure, as well as some measurement differences, between adolescents and their guardians.

Abstract = {Although bicultural competence has been viewed as an advantage for immigrants and other ethnic minorities in American society, we do not know whether bicultural socialization is similarly advantageous for children in families formed through international, transracial adoption. This study examines what factors enable adoptive Chinese children to achieve modest levels of bicultural competence. The data are from a longitudinal survey of parents who adopted children from China in the 1990s. Results indicate that parental attitudes toward bicultural socialization, parental social networks of Chinese adults, and the racial composition of the community all affect children's levels of Chinese cultural competence, while documenting how bicultural socialization can occur even when parents and children do not share a common birth culture. The implications of the findings for adoption agencies and professionals are also discussed, as well as the need for future research as the first cohorts of children adopted from China become adolescents.

Abstract = {In this chapter, we report on a Spanish-English enrichment bilingual preschool program that is being designed specifically for Puerto Rican children in the U.S. In general, enrichment bilingual preschool programs are characterized by substantial and prolonged use of Spanish and English (Beykont 1997a; Christian 1994; Lindholm 1990; Lindholm-Leary 2001, 2005). Native-English and native-Spanish speaking children are taught basic vocabulary and preliteracy skills and early concepts of math and science bilingually. The teachers are bilingual, and so are the instructional materials. The curriculum builds on what children know to teach the knowledge base valued in U.S. schools. These programs aim to develop children's bilingualism, inculcate pride in their cultural identities, and prepare children for the academic challenges of U.S. elementary schools. We first describe the sociopolitical context in which La Casa's Spanish-English enrichment bilingual preschool program operates. The theoretical framework that informed our work at this child-care center is then examined in relation to two essential program components, namely classroom language use and curriculum. The final part of the paper draws lessons from the experiences at La Casa and highlights the importance of developing a theory-based bilingual program.

Second, relevant empirical evidence pertaining to this particular model of the Chinese bicultural self was reviewed. Third, our present model was related and compared against various existing bicultural self models. Finally, directions and issues for future research on the Chinese bicultural self were discussed.

Abstract = {Four studies examined explicit and implicit perceptions of ethnicity and nationhood in New Zealand (NZ). NZ Europeans/Pakeha (the majority group) endorsed a bicultural perspective and explicitly rated both their own ingroup and Maori (the indigenous peoples of NZ) as contributing equally to NZ national identity and culture (Study 1). Contrary to the divergence between explicit and implicit ethnic-national associations observed in the USA, implicit associations in NZ were generally consistent with explicitly stated values. Pakeha and Maori, but not Asian New Zealanders, were both strongly implicitly associated with the national category NZ (Studies 1-3), although this general tendency was qualified by weak levels of ingroup favoritism from all three ethnic groups (Study 2). Finally, the small tendency for Pakeha to implicitly associate their ingroup more strongly with NZ was erased by using moderately well-known Pakeha and Maori rugby players as targets (Study 4). These findings contrast with the American = White implicit associations described by Devos and Banaji ([2005]), and provide insight into the ways in which socio-cultural realities foster convergence or divergence between explicit and implicit beliefs about equality and the function of ethnicity in nationhood.

Abstract = {This report contains several experiences and authentic examples taken from highly professional German-Polish and Polish-German coaching groups. Accordingly, ideas are in part presented from a very personal point of view. Running "Intercultural activities" is very much praised in a world that becomes more and more globalized. But how do these activities work out in practice? The author's goal is to explain the cultural differences in order for managers to be able to work effectively in international projects. The author illustrates her method and her goals by giving characteristic examples. She talks about demands as far as the personality of the coach is concerned, as well as about interferences within the coaching situation. A prevailing common culture in Europe does not (yet) exist which makes it even more important to talk about differences openly so that they can be understood and be overcome. Useful experiences are shared which shall help to build a 'working' trust level between representatives of different cultures. Cultural factors of power usage are described which show how power can be applied in different ways. The influence of language problems is also analyzed in detail. Finally, this paper shows that the most important is to keep an atmosphere based on cooperation: only when such an atmosphere is accepted as a natural daily routine can contacts among participants of different cultures be established as among equals and it is then possible to overcome the challenges related to differences of cultures.

The findings revealed that the participants consumed products that they felt made a statement about themselves, who they were and their public image. They consumed certain brands in preference to others to enhance their status in their community. Second generation participants felt a need to negotiate and balance the two cultures to which they belong and there are a number of subtle aspects to decision making.

Bicultural stress was reported by all ethnic groups and was significantly associated with more depressive symptoms and less optimism (only for females), after accounting for ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and age. Latino and Asian American youth were more likely to report more stressors, although after controlling for sociodemographic variables the differences predominantly remained only between Asian Americans and European Americans. Lower socioeconomic status, male gender, and not speaking English also were associated with more stress. The negative impact of bicultural stress on adolescent depressive symptoms and optimism indicates the need for mental health researchers and service providers to consider the cultural context of stress for adolescents.

We hypothesized that bicultural individuals who hold this essentialist belief about race are oriented to perceive rigid interracial boundaries and experience difficulty passing between their ethnic culture and the host culture. As predicted, we found that the more strongly Chinese American participants endorsed an essentialist belief about race, the less effective they were in switching rapidly between Chinese and American cultural frames in a reaction time task (Study 1), and the greater emotional reactivity they exhibited (reflected in heightened skin conductance) while they talked about their Chinese and American cultural experiences (Study 2). Taken together, these findings suggest that essentialist beliefs about race set up a mind-set that influences how bicultural individuals navigate between their ethnic and host cultures.

Abstract = {This study elaborated upon Sibley, Robertson, and Kirkwood's (2005) recently proposed model predicting individual differences in Pakeha (New Zealanders of European descent) support/opposition for the symbolic and resource-specific aspects of bicultural policy. The theory integrates research on the function of historical representations and collective guilt for historical injustices within the context of Duckitt's (2001) model of the dual motivational and cognitive processes underlying prejudice, and argues that the refutation of responsibility for historical injustices functions as a legitimizing myth justifying social inequality between Maori and Pakeha. Consistent with Duckitt (2001), structural equation modeling indicated that social conformity predicted dangerous world beliefs, which in turn predicted Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), whereas tough-mindedness predicted competitive world beliefs, which in turn predicted Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). SDO in turn predicted decreased levels of support for different aspects of bicultural policy, and as hypothesized, these effects were mediated by the refutation of responsibility for historical injustices. These findings provide further insight into the ideological attitudes thought to motivate (in this case SDO), and the justifications thought to legitimize (in this case the refutation of historical responsibility) expressions of opposition toward different aspects of bicultural policy in the New Zealand socio-political environment. The utility of this theoretical framework for assessing both the processes underlying, and the content of, socially elaborated discourses legitimizing discriminatory attitudes in other domains and across other cultural contexts is discussed.

To fully capture the dynamics of bicultural experiences, in the current article, we set out to examine biculturalism from a multilevel perspective: From individuals' basic psychological processes (e.g., cultural frame switching), to the interplay between the individuals and the social environment (e.g., individuals' perception of social boundaries), and the larger intersubjective societal context that the bicultural individuals face (e.g., social representations, stereotypes). We argue that individuals are active participants of intercultural processes. Through the multilevel approach, we can understand how individuals actively construct and co-construct their social milieu in a multicultural world.

The literature surrounding bicultural development is reviewed from four perspectives: (a) immigrant children and adolescents, (b) second generation Latinos or the offspring of immigrants, (c) later generation ethnic children and adolescents, and (d) mixed ethnic and racial heritage individuals. Each of these situations presents different socialization contexts and challenges for parents and children in the transmission of culture across generations and for the development of bicultural competence. The concepts of acculturation, marginality, and biculturalism are examined for the assumptions inherent in each of these constructs. An important assumption in the analysis is that maintenance of ethnic identity and bicultural orientation may be imposed on Latinos depending on their phenotype, which marks them as "outsiders" to the dominant social group. Thus, ethnic loyalty and biculturalism may serve as positive coping responses in a racialized society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Data comes from long-term participant observation; audio- and videotaping; field notes by adult participants; and interviews with MCM coordinators, volunteer mothers, and schoolteachers. Findings indicate that MCM children are processing competing language frameworks from home and school and revealing emergent language ideologies in their daily interactions with peers and adults. The study reveals the complexity of Latino children's language choices in informal educational settings and draws implications for pedagogical practices in multilingual classrooms.

Abstract = {Two experiments showed that American (vs. Chinese) culture priming influences Beijing Chinese undergraduates' self-construal and its attendant memory strategies. Following American culture priming (vs. Chinese culture priming or control), the participants used relatively more independent self-statements and fewer interdependent self-statements to describe the self (Experiment 1). They also performed more poorly in a delayed recognition test if they had encoded the study materials (personality adjectives) with reference to the mother (Experiment 2). These results demonstrate the activation effect of culture on self-construal and its attendant memory processes. The results also show that biculturals can access different cultural conceptions of the self and change cognitive strategies flexibly in response to cues of changing cultural demands in the immediate context.

Abstract = {Background: Acculturation is one of the determinants of mental health among immigrants. Evaluating adaptation to the host culture is insufficient, since immigrants will develop various degrees of bi- or multicultural identity. However, mental health professionals lack simple and easy to use instruments to guide them with bicultural identity evaluation in their practice. Our aim was to develop such an instrument to be used for clinical purposes among economical migrants from three South European countries living in Geneva, Switzerland. Methods: We adapted from existing instruments a 24 item bi-dimensional scale to assess involvement in both culture of origin and host culture. The study included 93 immigrant adults from three south European countries (Italy, Portugal and Spain). Thirty-eight patients were recruited in an outpatient treatment program for alcohol-related problems and 55 participants were hospital employees. Results: The questionnaire was rated as easy or rather easy by 97.8% of participants. Median time to complete it was 5 minutes. The instrument allowed discriminating between patients and healthy subjects, with scores for Swiss culture significantly higher among hospital workers. The subscales related to culture of origin and host culture displayed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.77 and 0.73 respectively). Conclusion: It is possible to assist clinicians' assessment of cultural identity of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish economical immigrants in Switzerland with a single and easy to use instrument.

Negotiating Bilingual and Bicultural Identities: Japanese Returnees Betwixt Two Worlds represents one of the most comprehensive volumes on the development of bilingual and bicultural identities. Through the identity narratives of four Japanese kikokushijo (returnee) students, drawn from a longitudinal study over 3.5 years as they move from adolescent years in North America to young adulthood in Japan, Kanno documents the changing process of the student's understanding of themselves and their relationship with the two languages and cultures. By presenting their narratives divided into three phases--sojourn to North America, reentry to Japan, and later reconciliation, Kanno maintains that the four students, Sawako, Kenji, Kikuko, and Rui, gradually moved away from an initial split between the two languages and cultures to more flexible ways of negotiating their hybrid identities, coming to appreciate their bilingual and bicultural identities. This book highlights the importance of understanding the role of identity investment in language classrooms, which is closely linked to academic success of immigrant and culturally diverse students and yet often dismissed within the realities of policy and practice in L2 education (cf. Cummins, 2001). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A culture-specific model integrating research on collective guilt and the perception of historical injustices, within the context of Duckitt's (2001) more universal dual process model of ideology and prejudice, is proposed. As expected, a majority of self-identified Pakeha (New Zealanders of European descent) sampled from the New Zealand population supported the symbolic principles of bicultural policy (66% support, 5% opposition) but opposed its resource-specific aspects, such as affirmative action policies (21% support, 37% opposition). Pakeha opposition toward the symbolic aspects of Maori-Pakeha intergroup relations was predicted directly by motivations for intergroup dominance and superiority (high Social Dominance Orientation); whereas the relationship between Social Dominance Orientation and opposition to resource-based issues, such as support for Maori claims to the foreshore, was notably weaker and fully mediated by both the refutation of responsibility for and absence of collective guilt for historical injustices, which it is argued functioned as a legitimizing myth justifying social inequality in this context. This model illuminates the role of group-based motivational goals (competitively-driven dominance and superiority, threat-driven control and conformity) and legitimizing myths (in this instance the refutation of responsibility for historical injustices) theorized to underlie Pakeha opposition toward different aspects of bicultural policy at a time when debate surrounding the legitimacy of Maori claims to the areas of the foreshore and seabed was beginning to intensify in early 2004.

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the acculturation model of second-culture-acquisition for Latino immigrants. Two theoretical frameworks, assimilation and alternation theories, are compared within the acculturation model. Empirical research findings suggest that assimilation is a risk factor for increases in negative health behaviors and mental health problems. Conversely, biculturalism appears to be an emerging protective factor that buffers assimilation stress, enhances socio-cognitive functioning, and increases academic achievement. A review of bicultural skills training interventions shows these programs are effective in decreasing the risk for problematic behavior. Finally, a refined model of bicultural skills training for Latino immigrant families is proposed based on the acculturation research literature and extensive interviews with Latino families in North Carolina.

Abstract = {Studies of autobiographical memory have shown that the degree to which individuals focus on themselves vs. social relations in their memories varies markedly across cultures. Do the differences result from differing cultural self-views (i.e., an autonomous vs. a relational sense of self), as often suggested in the literature? Experimental evidence is required to answer this question. In the present study, Asian American participants (N = 118) were primed to focus on their American or Asian self prior to recalling important autobiographical events, and participants in a control group described things in nature prior to the memory recall. Those whose American self was activated recalled more self-focused and less socially oriented memories than those whose Asian self was made salient, with the control group falling in between. The findings shed light on the mechanism underlying cultural influences on autobiographical remembering. They further highlight the dynamic nature of the memory-self interplay in cultural contexts.

In this book, the author reminds the reader that another way in which adolescent turbulence may be obviated is when parents keep a child "not grown up" indefinitely, encouraging dependence rather than the variety of autonomy that characterizes Western adolescence with its smorgasbord of identity choices. The insight the reviewer gained from reading Lam's book is that there is more than one way that cultural variations have obviated modal Western conceptions of adolescence. While much has been written about how cultures with defined puberty rites avoid the potential for adolescent turbulence by moving the child directly into adulthood, less has been said about cultures that strive to prolong dependency on parents. As such, this work describes an intriguing, apparently successful, alternative route for negotiating the path from childhood to adulthood, one that argues for cultural fidelity even for those adolescents who find themselves transplanted into a foreign cultural and psychological milieu.

Abstract = {In this chapter, the authors tell the story of American Airlines flight 587, which crashed after take-off in New York on its way to the Dominican Republic. This was a disaster in which mental health workers and the victims they cared for shared some cultural characteristics, but, importantly, not others. The authors examine ways in which the myth of sameness--the assumption that one person understands another because of ways in which they are the same--affects the establishment of empathy in the disaster situation, but also how it bears on the experience of the self. Since many of the workers and victims involved were Hispanic, or Latino, the flight 587 disaster provides an opportunity to explore what might be called the cultural self, which represents that aspect of identity comprised of our experience of ourselves in relation to our race, ethnicity, culture-driven effects on perspective and behavior, and our sense of our relation to other cultures. For the Puerto Rican American clinicians working with the Dominican families of flight 587, differences in country of origin, education, and degree of assimilation mattered less than their identification with the pain of people who felt like family in the crucible of disaster. The bicultural self was highlighted in their ambivalent reaction to the extreme form of grief displayed, but this was also related to their clinical understanding of the pathological aspects of these reactions.

Abstract = {Contemporary research on ethnic identity, acculturation, and cultural orientation suggests that, at least under some circumstances, individuals can successfully internalize or identify with more than one culture. Previous research on multicultural identity has relied almost exclusively on self-report measures. Using the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the present research examined to what extent Mexican American and Asian American college students identified with American culture and with their culture of origin. Results indicated that Mexican American and Asian American participants strongly and equally identified with both cultures. The present research provides firm evidence for a bicultural identity through assessments of thoughts that cannot be consciously controlled. Patterns of bicultural identification obtained on implicit measures were not the product of deliberate responses to normative demands or conscious attempts to convey a particular self-image.

Yasuko Kanno presents the reader with a unique reading experience by providing a book on bilingual bicultural narratives that is entertaining as well as scholarly and insightful. The organization of the text allows for a multiple reading: Following an introduction in which Kanno outlines her own journey across cultures, the next four chapters chronicle the lives of four students who are all kikukoshijo, Japanese returnees. Following these in-depth narratives, the final three chapters consider the theoretical and educational implications of such a study, couched in the context of research on immigrant bilingual bicultural youth. In addition, Kanno weaves her own voice as researcher and bicultural individual throughout her narrative. The heart of Kanno's book contains the in-depth narratives of four of Kanno's students in hoshuko, Japanese Saturday school in Canada. Kanno takes us from these students' original arrival in English-speaking countries, through their time in Canada, and extending through the first year after their return to Japan and admission to Japanese university. The focus of the narratives she presents is the examination of the diverse factors that have shaped and continue to shape the subjects' linguistic and cultural identities.

Abstract = {The present study examines the underresearched topic of bicultural identity; specifically, we: (1) unpack the construct of Bicultural Identity Integration (BII), or the degree to which a bicultural individual perceives his/her two cultural identities as "compatible" versus "oppositional," and (2) identify the personality (Big Five) and acculturation (acculturation stress, acculturation attitudes, bicultural competence) predictors of BII. Differences in BII, acculturation stress, and bicultural competence were measured with new instruments developed for the purposes of the study. Using a sample of Chinese American biculturals, we found that variations in BII do not define a uniform phenomenon, as commonly implied in the literature, but instead encompass two separate independent constructs: perceptions of distance (vs. overlap) and perceptions of conflict (vs. harmony) between one's two cultural identities or orientations. Results also indicated that cultural conflict and cultural distance have distinct personality, acculturation, and sociodemographic antecedents.

Abstract = {The bicultural experience of Africans in America (i.e., African Americans) is unique, complex, and dissimilar to other racial/ethnic groups living in the United States. The term "bicultural" is used to describe the experience of individuals living in two distinct cultures (Bell, 1990; Fishman, 1989). Current models of biculturalism assume that the acquisition of a second culture is a voluntary process and results in the development of an expanded repertoire of cultural behaviors; new behaviors are typically adopted from the dominant cultural/social group (Bell, 1990; LaFromboise, Coleman, & Gorman, 1993; Rudmin, 2003). Given that Africans in America were forcibly removed from their indigenous culture and subjected to a systematic program of deracination and forced acculturation, traditional theories of biculturalism are limited in their application with this population. The goal of this chapter is to review the literature on current conceptualizations of biculturalism, examine the historical bicultural experience of Africans in America, and discuss mental health issues related to the African American bicultural experience. The current chapter addresses the contemporary psychological issues related to the bicultural experience of African Americans through a historical lens. We begin with a review of the literature regarding traditional theories of biculturalism and their application to African Americans, Next, we examine the African origins of African American cultural beliefs, values, and behaviors. We also discuss the influence of the African slave trade, chattel slavery, and Jim Crow segregation on the bicultural identity development of African Americans and how it differs from that of other racial/ethnic groups who were not forcibly relocated to the United States. Finally, we examine the psychological issues related to biculturalism and the contemporary African American experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Biculturally competent individuals may adopt flexible forms of emotional expression that help them address not only acculturation stress but also the forms of distress that affect bicultural and monocultural individuals alike. In a sample of 174 bicultural undergraduates, level of bicultural competence moderated the effects of an "existential" aspect of depression (i.e., the sense of a foreshortened future) in predicting both expressive flexibility during wakefulness and emotional flux within the content of impactful dreams. Among individuals high in bicultural competence, those who sensed a foreshortened future following loss or trauma were more likely to report: (1) feeling exploration through direct self-reflection; (2) feeling exploration through aesthetic response; and (3) spontaneous emotional flux within impactful dreams. These findings suggest that expressive flexibility among biculturally competent individuals becomes evident in their manner of identifying, understanding, and expressing emotions during a stressful life event.

Abstract = {Prior research suggests that bicultural individuals (i.e., individuals with 2 distinct sets of cultural values) shift the values they espouse depending on cues such as language. The authors examined whether the effects of language extend to a potentially less malleable domain, behavioral decisions, exploring the extent to which bilingual individuals shift the underlying strategies used to resolve choice problems. Although past research has explained language- induced shifts in terms of knowledge accessibility principles, the motivation to conform to observers' norms can also drive these shifts. This article focuses on shifts in the general strategy of avoiding losses rather than pursuing gains, which is more often exhibited by Chinese than by Westerners. Five studies of Hong Kong bicultural individuals found that language manipulation (Cantonese vs. English) increases tendencies to choose compromise options in a product decision task, endorse associated decision guidelines that advocate moderation as opposed to extreme paths, defer decision making in problems where it can be postponed, and endorse decision guidelines that advocate caution rather than decisive action. A motivational explanation of these effects was confirmed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This paper presents recent work examining the meaning and impact of individual variations in the way bicultural individuals organize their two cultural identities, a construct the authors call Bicultural Identity Integration (BII). While biculturals high on BII describe their two cultural identities as 'compatible' (fluid and complementary), biculturals low on BII experience them as largely 'oppositional' (i.e., conflicting and disparate). The authors first report experimental evidence for how variations in BII moderate biculturals' socio-cognitive behavior, specifically, the way in which bicultural individuals process cultural knowledge and use it to interpret social behavior. The authors then report structural equation modeling findings that elucidate some important personality, contextual, and performance predictors of BII. Finally, the authors conclude with a brief discussion of how the study of bicultural identities provides an ideal ground for the integration of cultural and personality psychology.

Abstract = {The authors propose that cultural frame shifting--shifting between 2 culturally based interpretative lenses in response to cultural cues--is moderated by perceived compatibility between the two cultural orientations, or bicultural identity integration (BII). Three studies found that Chinese American biculturals who perceived their cultural identities as compatible (high BII) responded in culturally congruent ways to cultural cues: They made more external attributions after being exposed to Chinese primes and more internal attributions after being exposed to American primes. However, Chinese American biculturals who perceived their cultural identities as oppositional (low BII) exhibited a reverse priming effect. This trend was not apparent for noncultural primes. The results show that individual differences in bicultural identity affect how cultural knowledge is used to interpret social events. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Measurements included demographics, SAFE-C, A-COPE, Self-Perception Profile for Children, and Harter Teacher's Rating Scale. Latinos used more social support and religious coping strategies than Whites (p<.001). A general model of achievement for both groups accounted for 33% of the variance in academic achievement (p<.001). Ethnically specific models accounted for a greater amount of the variance: 57% for a model for Whites and 64% for a model for Latinos (p<.001).

However, few examples in the literature provide images of what it means to teach meaningful mathematics content in ways that build on diverse students' cultural and linguistic knowledge. The authors of this chapter, a mathematics educator and a bilingual educator, are engaged in research examining the challenges faced by teachers in bilingual and bicultural classrooms in urban schools. This chapter offers an analysis of fundamental issues involved in studying mathematics teaching in culturally and linguistically diverse, urban settings. We discuss and critique a framework that presents a view of teaching practices that integrates concerns about cultural contextualization and meaningful mathematics. We raise questions about research that depicts teaching as either successful or not according to idealized models of practice, arguing that teaching is best understood as existing along multiple, intersecting continua. Finally, we make recommendations for the focus and stance taken by researchers pursuing similar questions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Throughout the world, particularly in colonized countries, the health status of indigenous people and the unequal representation of indigenous people within the health workforce is of concern. In 2002, as part of a national health workforce development strategy, a qualification was developed to provide Maori (Indigenous New Zealander) health professionals with the skills and confidence to teach and supervise students on clinical placements in Maori health environments. This project required close collaboration between two education providers, one a Maori private education provider and the other a traditional government-funded tertiary institution; and for both organizations to work cooperatively with Maori communities and Maori health providers. The Christchurch College of Education (CCE) and Mauri Ora Associates are jointly involved in the administration, design and delivery of the programme, recruitment of guest lecturers, and ongoing curriculum updates. The content for the programme is mainstream, international and interprofessional but the pedagogy is Maori, with Maori customs, values and traditions upheld and practised. A national Maori health workforce development organization contracts independently with both organizations and provides an oversight and quality monitoring role. Together, the three organizations work with other Maori health professional groups and Maori elders to deliver the qualification. This paper describes how this course was designed, how it is delivered within a Maori paradigm, and how the outcomes are achieved. It also describes the cooperation between Maori and Pakeha (white New Zealanders) across health, community and educational organizations that was required to sustain this programme over five years and identifies some themes that may be applied in a global context. In sharing our experiences, we hope to inspire others to consider ways they can meet the needs of indigenous learners within their mainstream programmes.

Abstract = {New views of biculturalism have transformed the "melting pot" vision of American culture to one in which immigrants are encouraged to maintain multicultural diversity rather than assimilate to the dominant culture. Indeed, the marker of bicultural competence is now seen as the ability to display culturally appropriate behaviors in both the new and old cultural settings (e.g., LaFramboise, Coleman, & Gerton, 1993). Recent social cognitive research emphasizing both the shifting nature of the self (e.g., Gardner, Gabriel, & Lee, 1999) and of cultural world-views (e.g., Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martínez, 2000) can illuminate the mechanisms underlying this more dynamic form of biculturalism. The current research demonstrated bicultural flexibility by comparing monocultural (European-American) and bicultural (Asian- American) participants' self-construals, values, and responses to social obligations as a function of the situational accessibility of independent and interdependent self-construal. As expected, Asian-Americans appeared more responsive to the primes than their European-American counterparts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this research, I examined how biculturals, or individuals who have been equally influenced by an East Asian and Western cultural orientation, respond to various types of persuasion appeals that promote values unique to a particular culture. In the first experiment, I found that biculturals, relative to monoculturals, tend to react favorably toward both individually and interpersonally focused appeals due to their having 2 equally developed and accessible cultural dispositions. In the second experiment, I identified boundary conditions under which having relatively equal access to both cultural dispositions leads to favorable responses. Results indicate that biculturals who tend to compartmentalize each culture react less favorably toward appeals that are both individually and interpersonally focused than biculturals who tend to integrate the 2 cultures. In other words, the former type of bicultural prefers appeals that activate one cultural disposition, whereas the latter type of bicultural favors appeals that activate both cultural dispositions. These findings are discussed in light of the growing trend toward multiculturalism and the increasing need for researchers to understand the impact of this trend on various consumer behavior issues.

Abstract = {The basis for biculturalism in Aotearoa/New Zealand and the relevance of the Treaty of Waitangi to Maori mental health and clinical psychology training are discussed in this paper. Bicultural clinical training experiences are examined with reference to the clinical programme at the University of Waikato, Hamilton. The importance of cultural inclusion in training and therapy models is outlined. While significant progress in Maori recruitment and retention in the training programmes has been achieved, evidence suggests that Maori trainees are spending longer on clinical training programmes and indicating a preference for employment in Maori-based agencies. Non-Maori practitioners in mainstream agencies are encouraged to recognise the bicultural imperatives consequent on underrepresentation of Maori in their profession.

Abstract = {Notes that the children of immigrants possess bicultural identities that reflect their ethnic heritage and their membership in the wider community. For most, strong identification with the dominant culture creates a desire for full inclusion within it. In the case of visible minorities, however, physical dissimilarity is at times experienced as an "ethnifying" obstacle to assimilation or integration. One response to this challenge is compensatory alignment with the majority group when physical appearance is made salient. To demonstrate this phenomenon, the authors asked 94 Chinese Canadian participants (aged 17-25 yrs) to rate their liking of a set of abstract paintings. The ratings were made in relation to various normative anchors and either in the presence or absence of a mirror. As predicted, only participants in the presence of the mirror showed heightened conformity to the perceived European Canadian (majority group) norm. This tendency, however, was not matched with greater distancing from the perceived Chinese Canadian (minority group) norm. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a study of bicultural individuals' self-perceptions, Chinese-born students were randomly assigned to participate in either Chinese or English. Serving as controls, Canadian-born Ss of either European or Chinese descent participated in English. A total of 111 Ss (aged 18-40 yrs) participated. Ss completed questionnaires. The effects of the language manipulation paralleled findings in previous studies comparing East Asians to North Americans. Ss responding in Chinese reported more collective self-statements in open-ended self-descriptions, lower self-esteem on the Rosenberg scale, and more agreement with Chinese cultural views than did the remaining groups. In their self-descriptions, Ss writing in Chinese provided similar numbers of favorable and unfavorable self-statements. The other groups reported more favorable self-statements. Ss reporting in Chinese indicated similar levels of positive and negative mood. The remaining groups reported more positive mood. The results suggest that East-Asian and Western identities may be stored in separate knowledge structures in bicultural individuals, with each structure activated by its associated language.

Abstract = {Explored how communication practices at Chinese language schools affected bicultural identity development for new Chinese immigrants and their children (aged 4-13 yrs). Ethnographic research at a Chinese school in Chicago involved participation, observation, and interviews. 35 parents were interviewed regarding: (1) reasons they send their children to the school, (2) communicative activities in which they participate, (3) impact of school activities on children's bicultural identity development and their own psychological well-being, (4) perceptions of Chinatown, and (5) suggestions for future development of the school. The results indicate a desire for cultural preservation as well as motivation for bicultural identity development and awareness of the benefits of biculturalism. Parents expressed a willingness to engage the larger society, but a rejection of an identity associated with Chinatown. This study is seen to challenge the conventional notion that middle-class Asian Americans are well assimilated into American society or that they are identified with their ethnic enclaves only. The author concludes that communication can transcend cultural identity, and suggests that biculturalism, as opposed to Americanization, is related to positive adjustment for immigrants and their children.

Abstract = {The growing population of Mexican American youth and the increasing smoking rates in this population present a considerable public health challenge. Tobacco counteradvertisements have demonstrated their ability to shape attitudes, behavior, and public policy, but little is known about the most effective ways to adapt messages aimed at this audience. To explore key variables that can affect success, a study was conducted with 249 Mexican American middle-school youth from a U.S./Mexico border community to examine the effectiveness of language (English, Spanish, or a combination of English and Spanish) and theme (secondhand smoke, antitobacco social norms, and tobacco industry manipulation) in print tobacco counteradvertisements. Measures included ad preferences, acculturation, and tobacco-related attitudes and behavior. Results showed that although a large percentage identified with the Mexican American rather than the Anglo American culture and spoke Spanish in selected contexts, readability was greater for ads in English, and participants rated the English ads as most effective. The social norms counteradvertisement was preferred overall. Potential implications for health communication and policy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Interviews were conducted with four Latina elementary school teachers (in their mid- to late-20s) to examine the relationship between their bicultural identities and their attitudes toward English and Spanish. Findings point to a strong correlation between identification with Latino culture, political consciousness, and value for the Spanish language as a means of affirming the cultural identities of Latino students.

Abstract = {From its inception, self psychology has asserted the belief that development is possible throughout life. The nexus of development, according to Kohut, is certain relational experiences. Kohut's focus on development within the analytic relationship provided a rich and ample context for further theoretical cultivation, evidenced by the eight broad paradigms now considered a part of contemporary self psychology. In addition to traditional self psychology (Kohut, 1977), these paradigms include intersubjectivity and contextualism (Stolorow, Atwood, and Orange, 2002), self and motivational systems (Lichtenberg, Lachmann, and Fosshage, 1992), specificity theory (Bacal, 1985), attachment/infant research (Beebe and Lachmann, 2002), developmental systems self psychology (Shane, Shane, and Gales, 1997), nonlinear dynamic systems theory or complexity theory (Trop, Burke-Trop, and Trop, 1999; Coburn, 2002), and relational self psychology (Fosshage, 2003). In this paper, I discuss the treatment of a bicultural couple--Tyler, a Caucasian woman, and Ben, a Japanese man, from an attachment systems perspective. This theoretical base incorporates nonlinear dynamic systems theory, attachment/infant research, and some additional currents outside self psychology which I believe enrich our dialogue.

Results revealed a variation in the mean occurrence of the clinical indicators in consumer case notes of 18.5-89.9%. Five factors with good internal consistency, encompassing domains of mental health nursing required for best practice, were derived from analysis of the questionnaire.

Specifically, it explores media coverage of Maori protest occupations in terms of the agency afforded to these groups, and in terms of the reiterative role of the media in 'performatively' reproducing the social spaces that constitute New Zealand. The 1995 occupation of Pakaitore/ Moutoa gardens in Wanganui by local Maori, was the focus for this investigation. The study located eighty articles printed in The New Zealand Herald and eighty seven articles printed in The Dominion over the 79-day occupation period. First, coding and word counts were used to determine amount of voice afforded to the main interest groups. Second, the way media (re)present these voices was examined through: amount of quoting vs. paraphrasing; length of quote; and juxtaposition of accounts with alternative accounts. The amount of voice afforded to Maori was found to be more consistent with status as a minority under multiculturalism, than with their status as equal partners under the Treaty of Waitangi (and biculturalism)...

In a review of acculturation literature, the authors discuss the modes of the acculturation process and their connection to levels, external and environmental influences, internal or constitutive influences, and the connection to personality factors. A conceptual assumption of the division of Ss into 2 groups (high vs low acculturation) was that the social interest and the lifestyles of bicultural Latinos differed among these 2 groups, but the high and low acculturation groups did not differ on social interest or the lifestyles. In a sample of 313 Latinos (mean age 31 yrs), Ss were instructed to complete a demographic questionnaire and 2 self-report inventories on interpersonal success and acculturation. The results confirm the notion that Adlerian lifestyles are relevant in the examination of cultural dynamics. The results indicate that the variables Belonging/Social Interest and Taking Charge discriminated between the high, low, and bicultural Latinos, and the lifestyles Being Cautious, Going Along, and Wanting Recognition did not discriminate between the groups. Also, bicultural Latinos obtained higher scores on both factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Individualism, collectivism, self-enhancing biases, and attitudes toward tall poppies (i.e., high achievers) were investigated in New Zealand European and Maori students. 280 (215 women, 65 men) New Zealand European and 88 (55 women, 33 men) Maori students at Victoria University of Wellington participated in the study. Whereas Maori exhibited a stronger orientation to the collective, they also showed higher self-esteem. Group-oriented Maori displayed slightly higher levels of self-enhancement and were more likely to favor the rewarding of high achievers (tall poppies). Both groups displayed high levels of self-enhancement and favored the reward of high achievers, with both self-enhancement on the Self-Attributes Questionnaire and attitudes toward tall poppies being correlated with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results are discussed in the context of a bicultural nation of both Maori and European origins, and consideration is given to a bicultural rather than categorical perspective on independence and interdependence.

Abstract = {Studied 46 middle- and working-class Mexican American (mean age 15.7 yrs) and 52 middle-class African-American (mean age 16.1 yrs) students from ethnically diverse high schools, to identify the ways in which minority adolescents deal with being part of 2 cultures. Ss were interviewed about their sense of being ethnic, American, and bicultural. Ss also completed questionnaire measures of ethnic identity, American identity, other-group attitudes, self-concept, and anxiety. Qualitative analysis of the interviews revealed 3 types of identification patterns: blended biculturals, alternating biculturals, and separated adolescents. Scores on American identity and other-group attitudes differed significantly among the identification patterns. Ethnic and American identity were generally uncorrelated, supporting the multidimensional (vs linear) view of being bicultural. Nearly 90% of the Ss, all except the separated adolescent group, considered themselves to be bicultural (both ethnic and American), but the meaning of being bicultural had qualitatively different meanings within and across ethnic groups. Results illustrate the varied types of identification manifested by ethnic minority adolescents in relation to their 2 reference groups, ethnic and American.

Abstract = {In this chapter, we have sketched the challenges that becoming literate poses to all learners, then elaborated evidence that learning to read is a particular challenge for the L2/C2 (second language/second culture) learner. There were two themes in our analysis. The first is the complexity of the challenges posed, both to newcomers in a society and to the locals who are responsible for teaching, working with, or interacting with the newcomers, by the need to learn each others' languages, literacies, discourse patterns, and culturally prescribed ways of operating. We have argued that, if L2/C2 learners are to catch up with monolinguals in the academic, linguistic, and literacy skills needed for success in school and in the workplace, educational procedures are needed that enhance transfer, thus exploiting the knowledge of the L1 and C1 that learners bring with them. The second theme is the need, in complex and multifaceted domains like second-language learning and education for language minorities, for practice-embedded and practice-inspired research to complement the contributions of traditional basic and applied research. The fastest route to understanding what educational treatments work best to ensure language and literacy acquisition for various subgroups of L2 learners is to study successful practice, to build on the wisdom accumulated by successful practitioners, and to systematize that wisdom to be able to test it and make it public.

Matte-Blanco's theory of the mind (1988) from the perspective of 2 creation myths, asymmetrical and symmetrical modes of thought, and an example of bicultural therapy. Specifically, the author discusses the Hindu myth of creation and compares it to the Judeo/Christian myth. Interactions between creation myths, culture and Matte-Blanco's theory, are discussed, as well as cultural/mythological determinants of personality, cross cultural understandings of the mind, and the relationship between culture and the mind. Differences in asymmetrical and symmetrical modes of thought are illustrated in a case report describing a 33 yr old woman from India presenting with depression and the idea that she was being punished for something that her ancestors had done. It is concluded that the connection between archetypal creation myths and the ties between people in different cultures is clarified by Matte-Blanco's theory. All—creation myth, relationships, and Matte-Blanco theory—are vital to our understanding of the continuous process of self-creation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Autobiographical memories retrieved by bicultural Russian-English bilinguals were compared across languages. Results suggest that bilinguals' languages may influence cognitive styles, so that when speaking a language associated with a more individualistic culture, bilinguals produce more individualistic narratives, whereas when speaking a language associated with a more collectivist culture, bilinguals produce more collectivist narratives, regardless of language of encoding, or main agent in the narrative. Moreover, bilinguals expressed more intense affect when speaking the same language at the time of retrieval that they spoke at the time when the event took place. The positive/negative emotional valence of autobiographical narratives was influenced by language and age at the time of the event and by the main agent in the narrative. It is proposed that memories and self-narratives in bilinguals are mediated by the language spoken at any given time and that language functions as a vehicle for culture, with cultural differences seeping into language and influencing cognitive styles and the self.

The authors interviewed 8 adoptive families about their cognitive, emotional, and familial experiences. Qualitative analyses showed consistency in the parent and child interviews (conducted independently) and ratings of the children's kinetic family drawings. Themes included parents identifying the family multiculturally, promoting ethnic pride, and worrying about bigotry. Their ways of educating their children about race differed considerably, however. Results also indicated a developmental progression in the children's understanding of ethnicity in relation to adoption. Although the data indicated good psychosocial adjustment and strong family attachments, most of these children struggle with a sense of "being different," and some experience feelings of sadness and loss.

The objective was to gather recommendations as to how to improve bicultural training and mental health services for Maori. Of the 247 psychiatrists responding to a questionnaire, 40% believed their training had prepared them to work effectively with Maori. Recommendations for improving training focused on the need for greater understanding of Maori perspectives of well-being. Recommendations for improving mental health services for Maori highlighted the need for more Maori professionals and for Maori-run services. No psychiatrists thought that pakeha clinicians should not work with Maori clients, but the majority (70%) recognized the need to consult with Maori staff when doing so. 28 psychiatrists, all male, New Zealand born, and with 10 or more years clinical experience, believed that Maori were biologically or genetically more predisposed than others to mental illness. Several Ss offered other racist comments. The high response rate and the many positive recommendations suggest a high level of constructive interest in these issues among psychiatrists.

Before the author's narrative study of the social identities of Japanese returnees, however, most of the literature focused on their problems with re-entry, readjustment, language acquisition or attrition, or the debate of whether they deserve pity or envy. This book, based on her doctoral dissertation study, follows four returnees over a period of three years, between Canada and Japan, high school and college, to examine how changes in social context and maturity affect their identities. She roughly divides their narratives into three parts: sojourn abroad, return to Japan, and reconciliation to their hybrid identities. The author makes important theoretical contributions to both the communities of practice framework and narrative studies of social identity and language learning. In this book, she extends the conversation she has been carrying on with Kelleen Toohey about the definition of and conditions for legitimate peripheral participation in communities of practice, especially when societal racism ostracises and silences would-be participants.

On an individual level the motivation for contact and positive attitudes toward one another were most frequently reported. On the group level the ability to collaborate and hearing colleagues' competence in sign-language were most frequently reported. A combined counselling and guidance model was suggested on both levels. Furthermore, regarding the working group, group therapeutic approaches were also needed.

Abstract = {Among 23 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries surveyed by the World Health Organization's (1995) World Health statistics Annual, New Zealand ranks first for fatal suicidal behavior, in males 15–24 years of age, and third for fatal suicidal behavior in females. A United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF, 1996) survey of 32 countries places New Zealand males as third highest for fatal suicidal behavior, and females as eighth highest in the age group 15–24 years. New Zealand has recently undergone a number of social and economic changes that have created dramatic social and cultural shifts. Given the rapidity of these changes, the shock on such a small country has been difficult to absorb. These shifts have placed tremendous pressures on families and service support systems, such as health and mental health services, to develop programs that are relevant and acceptable for a bicultural society. This article focuses on these changes and the effect they have had on cultural narratives of gender and suicidal behavior, the different cultural etiologies that underlie these statistics, and recommendations for intervention and prevention program development.

Three previously well-established cognitive views of stereotyping (attribution theory, categorization theory, and social identity theory) are integrated into a comprehensive model in which the nature of a leader's dispositional stereotype of the subordinate (positive or negative) as well as the leader's perception of the subordinate's performance (success or failure) serve as the dimensions upon which leader attributions and subsequent behaviors are delineated. The focus then shifts to organizational issues, as the implications for management issues and practices are discussed and future research directions are highlighted.

Abstract = {There is now wide acceptance of what constitutes the core elements of an effective treatment program for sexual offenders against children. However, it has been recognized that there is a need to develop specific programs for special groups. It is the provision of effective assessment and treatment for Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, that is the focus of this chapter.  The rationale for developing a bicultural treatment program for sexual offenders is presented, along with general concerns in cross-cultural and ethnic psychology. Issues relating to Maori and the process of colonization in New Zealand are reviewed, as well as efforts aimed at both increasing understanding and addressing difficulties facing Maori. We then outline a program for treating Maori men who have offended sexually against children. This program, which also caters for non-Maori clients, involves an adaptation of the standard form and consists of the widely accepted core components. The program includes additional components and processes specifically focused on the needs of Maori. A cultural perspective policy has provided the blueprint for this development and is presented together with a review of progress to date.

Abstract = {Presents a model of individual categorization processes and perceptions in bicultural organizational teams as they are affected by a team's diversity profile and organizational norms. Individual characteristics and attitudes that members bring with them to team situations are defined. A typology is suggested of categorizations that individual team members use to define themselves based on visible demographic characteristics, informational demographic characteristics, or more inclusive groupings, such as those based on team or organizational membership. It is argued that the type of categorization that an individual uses depends on temporal (pre-interaction vs interaction phases) and knowledge (partial vs full) considerations. It is proposed that a group's diversity profile based on visible and informational characteristics is a contextual element that will affect the way each member categorizes themselves and others. The authors also contend that the norms within the organization regarding the acceptance of diverse views will also affect how individuals categorize themselves and others. How this categorization process affects perceived conflict is explained. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {A survey of 811 speech/language pathologists (SLPs), in 5 states across the United States was conducted to determine their beliefs about the language assessment of bilingual/bicultural individuals. SLPs who learned a second language in the context of cultural experience (CE group) reported more personal efficacy in bilingual assessment than speech-language pathologists who learned a second language via academic study (AS group), who in turn felt more competent than monolingual SLPs (M group). Furthermore, the 3 groups of respondents differed in terms of attributions for their low personal efficacy. The M group was most likely to mention their lack of knowledge about bilingual issues, the AS group commented on their less than optimal language proficiency, and the CE group focused on both proficiency and experience as influences. Over half of all participants reported that bilingual input in a child's environment would influence their interpretation of that child's language assessment results. Most of these participants reported that they would be more conservative in recommending language therapy for a bilingual than a monolingual child, particularly due to the respondent's own lack of knowledge of bilingual issues.

Abstract = {Examines the concepts of bilingualism and biculturalism and determines how they apply to the deaf person. If a bilingual is a person who uses 2 or more languages (or dialects) in everyday life, then most deaf people who sign and who use the majority language regularly are bilingual. Deaf bilinguals share many similarities with hearing bilinguals (e.g., their use of various language modes) but they are also characterized by a number of specificities (e.g., the lack of recognition of their bilingual status). If a bicultural person is defined as one who lives in 2 or more cultures, who adapts to each and who blends aspects of each, many deaf are indeed bicultural. Implications of these concepts for the education of deaf children are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined self-concept and social acceptance among 154 Black and 203 White Zimbabwean 7th graders attending racially integrated schools. A self-description questionnaire and multiple measures of social acceptance were used. Although Black children had levels of global self-esteem comparable with, or higher than, that of their White classmates, Black pupils taught by White teachers had significantly lower reading and academic self-esteem. Pupils in classes taught by Black teachers tended to choose for best friends peers in other classes significantly more than did pupils in classes taught by White teachers. Analysis by gender indicated that males tended to have significantly higher physical ability, physical appearance, and math self-esteem and relatively higher levels of social participation than females. Results partially supported the bicultural competence, subjective culture, and the insulation hypotheses on children's social status in multiracial school contexts.

Successful mentors are biculturally competent, proud of their origins, and effective in underclass as well as mainstream contexts.

When protégés lack skills required for bicultural competence, mentoring combined with behavioral skill training at home, at school, and with peers can promote acquisition, generalization, and maintenance of necessary skills. A prevention program offering mentoring and behavioral skill training in multiple natural contexts offers both political pragmatism and scientific credibility.

Abstract = {Researchers have noted that with the onset of adolescence, girls' voices become muted and school achievement drops. Girls learn that the expression of strong feelings leads to distance from others, and that full use of their bodies and minds cause others discomfort. Self-esteem suffers and girls become "at risk" for destructive behaviors. Most studies have been done with middle class Caucasian girls. Those few studies done with young girls of color speak of girls "on the margin" who seem to resist losing their voices and their self-esteem. This article describes a study involving 5th-8th grade girls (aged 10-14 yrs) participating in an Advisory group program at a grammar school in a predominantly Mexican community of a large city. Group sessions were taped and analyzed for common themes including voice and self-esteem. Focus was directed to the influence of the bicultural/bilingual environment in analysis of group content.

Although a number of follow-up studies indicate a 70-80% positive outcome, some ICAs end in painful family- child disruptions. There is, therefore, a growing need for bilingual/ bicultural mental health services to improve the initial adjustment process and to facilitate a positive long-term outcome. These services are especially needed when the child is older at arrival and the adopting family lives in a mostly homogeneous community. Suggested prearrival, arrival, and follow-up interventions with the family, the child, and the school are described.

Abstract = {Two studies examined Pakeha (New Zealanders of European descent) attitudes towards biculturalism in New Zealand. In Study one, Pakeha who were lower in Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) expressed increased support for an affirmative action policy providing postgraduate scholarships for ethnic minorities only in the absence of material self-interest (i.e., only when they themselves would not be competing for scholarships). In contrast, Pakeha higher in SDO opposed this policy regardless of self-interest. Study two used qualitative responses evoked in the first study to develop a scale distinguishing between attitudes towards (a) biculturalism in principle (general acceptance of a partnership between Maori (the indigenous peoples of New Zealand) and, Pakeha as a central aspect of social representations of New Zealand identity) and (b) resource-specific biculturalism (support for policies to redistribute resources in favour of Maori on a categorical basis). In Study two, a majority of Pakeha students supported biculturalism in principle (53% support, 3% opposition) but were opposed to resource-specific biculturalism (3% support, 76% opposition). As expected, SDO moderated this effect. Pakeha low in SDO (and to a lesser extent Right-Wing Authoritarianism) supported biculturalism in principle; however, they were relatively opposed to resource-specific biculturalism regardless of SDO. Consistent with integrated threat theory, we argue that symbolic threats to identity and values must be distinguished from realistic threats to material interests, especially in contexts like New Zealand where biculturalism is part of the national ideology for governance. This distinction is critical for understanding how values, such as group equality, influence perceptions of policy relating to minority-majority group relations.

Abstract = {Research comparing cultural and ethnic groups on child psychopathology has relied heavily on parent reports. But don't parents' own cultural backgrounds bias their reports, undermining valid assessment of actual child behavior? The question is hard to address because parent and child culture tend to be confounded. To solve this problem, we assembled an unusual but heuristically valuable sample: 50 bicultural families, each with an ethnic Thai parent reared in Thailand and a Caucasian parent reared in the U.S. Parents in each pair independently completed standardized problem checklists on the same child in their family. Across all 10 empirically derived problem syndromes, no parental culture effect was either significant or larger than "small," by Cohen's (1988) standards; across all 140 specific problems, the mean percent of variance accounted for by parent culture was less than 1%. Results do not point to a biasing effect of parental culture. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {One of the dilemmas in behavioral assessment is the extent to which both specific functional analyses and more general case formulations are dependent on professional judgement and thus subject to bias. While in theory the functional analysis represents hypotheses about controlling variables which can then be subjected to empirical test, the clinical reality is that many such hypotheses are only loosely evaluated, post-hoc, by virtue of the success, or otherwise, of treatment. The role of cultural variables in the development and testing of hypothesized functional relationships is thus particularly difficult to evaluate. This paper suggests guidelines for evaluating the cultural context of behavioral assessment in clinical practice. The proposed criteria are seen as having relevance in assessing clients of both dominant and nondominant cultures. In Aotearoa / New Zealand these issues are examined within a bicultural framework. Legal and moral imperatives defining a partnership between two peoples mandate additional considerations for sound clinical assessment. The practical implications of these issues for ensuring a culturally sensitive application of behavioral assessment principles are examined according to psychometric standards, principles of behavior change, and ethics.

Infant mortality and morbidity are measures of community health and collective well being. Birth weight and length of gestation are the primary indicators of infant mortality targeted in perinatal interventions. Infant mortality rates among Sub Saharan African (SSA) women are 105.4 per 1,000 live births (World Bank Group, 2003), but few USA programs address the unique needs of this population. West End Medical Centers (WEMC) and Oakhurst Medical Centers (OMC) developed the Bilingual/Bicultural Service Demonstration Program (BBSDP) to address identified needs of pregnant SSA immigrant women in metropolitan Atlanta. Research evaluators at Morehouse School of Medicine Prevention Research Center (PRC) have partnered with WEMC and OMC to gauge program impact. The marriage of research and practice is realized through the interdisciplinary alliance between BBSDSP staff and PRC evaluators. The PRC evaluation team worked with WEMC and OMC to conduct an inventory of current measurement efforts, create an evaluation plan, and provide technical assistance during the program's first year. Achievement of initial goals signal that the foundation has been laid for continued program evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Methods and approaches used to foster English language acquisition in deaf students have a history of change. The recent use of manually coded English (MCE) systems has not produced desired results. Current research on American Sign Language (ASL) has proved it to be a genuine language with its own systems for making words and sentences. The acceptance of ASL has led to increased demands that deaf students be allowed to acquire ASL as a 1st language and English as a 2nd language. Proposed methods for teaching English as a 2nd language have been drawn from models of 2nd language acquisition in hearing speakers. Because language and culture are closely related, these proposed bilingual ASL/English models include a cultural as well as a linguistic component. Several proposed models and related research are examined, and a pilot program for bilingual/bicultural teaching is suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Drawing on J. Cummins' (1989) linguistic interdependence model, proponents of bilingual-bicultural models of literacy education for deaf students claim that, if American Sign Language is well established as the L1, then literacy in English (L2) can be achieved by means of reading and writing without exposure to English through either speech or English-based sign. In the authors' opinion, this claim is based on a false analogy: the situation of the deaf learner of English literacy does not match the conditions assumed by the linguistic interdependence model. The authors draw on the work of L. S. Vygotsky and M. A. K. Halliday to develop a conceptualization of the processes involved in becoming literate, examining the particular and unique challenges that deaf students face as they strive to become members of the linguistic community of users of written English. They argue that becoming literate involves mastering three modes of language use: "social speech," "inner speech," and written text. In some respects the educational context for deaf students is analogous to that of other bilingual learners; in some crucial aspects, it is very different.

Although eleven participants were found to have had marginalized, separated, or alternating integrated patterns in high school, all 16 had either assimilated or blended integrated patterns at midlife. Further, there is evidence that the contexts in which identity negotiation occurred-specifically, the rigidity of the participants' Latvian and American contexts in high school and their relative openness at midlife-influenced these changes in pattern. The findings also underscore the importance of taking into account within-group differences when studying how people negotiate their cultural identities.

Abstract = {This book examines the changing linguistic and cultural identities of bilingual students through the narratives of four Japanese returnees (kikokushijo) as they spent their adolescent years in North America and then returned to Japan to attend university. As adolescents, these students were polarized toward one language and culture over the other, but through a period of difficult readjustment in Japan they became increasingly more sophisticated in negotiating their identities and more appreciative of their hybrid selves. The author analyzes how educational institutions both in their host and home countries, societal recognition or devaluation of bilingualism, and the students' own maturation contributed to shaping and transforming their identities over time. Using narrative inquiry and communities of practice as a theoretical framework, she argues that it is possible for bilingual individuals to learn to strike a balance between two languages and cultures. This book will interest researchers, educators, and graduate students who are concerned with the education and personal growth of bilingual learners, and will be useful as text for courses in ESL/bilingual education, TESOL, applied linguistics, and multicultural education.

Results show that all subjects (Ss) reported being teased in childhood, resulting in confusion about differences, and the desire to be like everyone else. Ss also reported an emphasis on studying, strict household rules, and emotionally distant fathers that they attributed to being Chinese. Upon leaving home, Ss experienced the 3 responses of culture shock, a sense of independence, and an increase in personal freedom.

Abstract = {This study is based on the link between the field of social representations and norms, and the problem of biculturalism among young women of Maghrebian origin. The use of Boolean logic demonstrates compensatory structures and lets us make the concept of "normative models" operational: for these young women from a Maghrebian and French background, there are different ways of belonging within the norm. Students use compensatory structures which illustrate their strategies of negotiation with the family very well. These compensations permit them to remain within "the norm" with regard to their cultural origin; moreover, they show a positive valorization of self. Different from the students, the non-students in family conflict look less at compensating the gap with the majority. Their compensatory structures show a certain incoherence and a negative self-esteem. The normative system of the students seems more structured and balanced than that of the nonstudents.

The group aimed to assist the carers to consider what special needs their foster children had as well as to challenge their understanding of the impact of racism in society and of their own assumptions. The ethnicity of group workers, of the consultant, and of other agency staff were all highly relevant to the success of the group and to the particular difficulties it encountered. The bicultural worker team was especially valuable in confronting the defensive attitudes that prevailed among group members. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This reprinted article originally appeared in the ( Australian Journal of Education of the Deaf, Vol 2, pp. 5–9). This article touches on some of the major claims made in explications of bilingual models of literacy education for deaf students (C. Baker, 1997; S. Livingston, 1997; S. N. Mashie, 1995; and D. Mason and C. Ewoldt, 1996). The goal is to broaden the scope of the discussion on some of the major arguments and to encourage an expanded dialogue in this ongoing debate. It is not the authors' aim to argue against the concept of bilingual education for deaf students nor to advocate the exclusion of native sign languages from the classroom. Rather, they support the concept of a bilingual education for deaf students with native sign languages playing a key role; however they contend that the model as it is currently conceived requires further scrutiny and analysis.

Abstract = {Three studies are summarized which show the potential value of tactile aids for the development of improved speech production skills by profoundly deaf children. The 1st study examined the use of a tactile display of high frequency speech energy (2–7kHz) by a profoundly deaf female adult. The results obtained showed greatly improved discrimination when the tactile display supplemented hearing aid use. In the 2nd study, an 18-yr-old congenitally deaf man was provided with speech training using tactile aids to provide modeling and feedback. Recordings made pre- and posttraining of the S's productions of consonants in /aCa/, and simple sentences were played to panels of normal-hearing listeners. The results showed large improvements in the posttraining tokens. The final study outlines the results of speech training with tactile aids provided to 15 deaf individuals (aged 4–19 yrs). Test results show rapid changes in the Ss' speech production skills with accumulating evidence of transfer to meaningful communication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Examined the bilingual and bicultural identity and concomitant problems of kikokushijo, children of Japanese expatriates who return to Japan after a prolonged sojourn abroad. In the longitudinal study 4 kikokushijo (aged 17–18 yrs) completing high school in Toronto completed 2–3 interviews prior to leaving Canada and follow-up interviews every 6 mo for 2 yrs following their return to Japan. Identified common themes include adjustment difficulties, misfit identities, and ambivalent cultural and ethnic allegiance; each S coped differently. Despite the now prevalent view that little discrimination against kikokushijo remains, schools in both the host and home countries still tend to fault them for what they do not know, while giving little recognition to their bilingual and bicultural abilities. Findings suggest that factors that impede the adjustment of kikokushijo may come from both society and themselves… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Of the many factors affecting test validity, ethnicity has received comparatively little attention. In 2 recent studies (T. V. Barnfield, 1995; B. Grimmer, 1994) after head injury, Maori performed at lower levels on measures of neuropsychological functioning than their non-Maori counterparts. To begin exploring the sources of this discrepancy, a pilot survey was conducted to determine how the neuropsychological examination experience was perceived. In consultation with recent Maori clients, the authors designed a questionnaire of satisfaction with their service. Fifteen 23–56 yr old Maori and non-Maori Ss completed a questionnaire that covered areas such as demographics, degree of identification with Maori culture, preassessment anxiety and overall perception of neuropsychological assessment. Most Ss felt they had not been given adequate information by the referral agent to prepare them for the assessment. Maori were less satisfied overall with the service, especially in the areas concerning current Maori cultural practices, physical surroundings, type of service, and quality of service. Implications for changing test instruments are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Describes the advantages of the social skills training (SST) model and the utility of the concept of bicultural competence as more adequately meeting mental health needs of Native Americans than present government practices. An illustration of the process of culturally adapting SST is provided by outlining an assertion training program developed with and for Native Americans. The specifics were refined over 1 yr as a result of interactions with 30 tribal groups and agencies. Situations were identified in which Native Americans wished they had behaved differently (e.g., challenging employers who stereotyped Native Americans). The Native American traditions of role modeling, apprenticeship training, and group consensus parallel the SST principles of instruction, modeling, behavior rehearsal, reinforcement, feedback, skill improvement, and generalization to the natural environment. The key instructional element of this assertion program stressed the situation-specific nature of assertiveness. Discrimination skills in bicultural rights, language styles, social expectations, and social reinforcers were essential in training for bicultural competence. Native American group support and consensus were noticeable during behavior rehearsal and reinforcement segments. (28 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The best-adjusted Ss were bicultural, although oriented more toward the Latino than the Anglo culture. Quality of life depended upon determiners similar to that of the US mainstream culture: family, work, having children, physical health, education, spouse relationship, and religion. Depression levels and negative affect were higher than those reported for non-Latino samples, although overall psychological well-being was not significantly different. Input from the Latino community was used to construct a definition of psychological adjustment and facilitated the development of a culturally sensitive scale of psychological adjustment. Well-adjusted Ss, compared to the least well-adjusted Ss, had (a) better paying jobs, (b) a better education, (c) more years lived in the US, and (d) higher levels of acculturation.

Abstract = {Studied the effect of a 1st-grade bilingual-bicultural program on 3 nonintellectual attributes of children: self-concept, self-descriptions, and stimulus-seeking activity. 2 groups of 14 Chicanos and Anglos participated in the program. Ss were compared with 17 Chicano and 22 Anglo nonparticipant controls. All Ss were pre- and posttested on the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale and the Howard Maze Test. Results indicate that the program significantly enhanced the self-concepts of girls but not boys. The primary effect of the program on self-descriptions appeared to be in providing a situation where Chicanos no longer felt "picked on" and where their feelings of unhappiness, as expressed earlier in the program, were alleviated. In terms of changes in stimulus-seeking activity (i.e., openness to environmental stimuli), there seemed again to be a sex difference, with girls showing a significant improvement and boys showing no significant change. The control group showed no significant changes in self-concept or in stimulus-seeking activity for either sex. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examines bicultural conflict resulting from the clash between the customs of a newly adopted country and the values, customs, traditions, and heritage of the country from which an individual has emigrated. This problem is examined in relation to the difficulties (e.g., confusion, anxiety) it poses to Chinese immigrant children. Cultural differences are examined with regard to aggressive behavior, sexuality, thrift, affection, dependency, individualism, sports, tattling, education, respect for authority, and heroes and heroines. It is suggested that, faced with situations where courses of action are diametrically opposed or radically different, the immigrant child is often immobilized, not having the maturity to evaluate or modify choices or to adjust his/her values. It is concluded that both teachers and parents should be aware of these potential conflicts, avoid exacerbating the differences, and encourage in the immigrant child a healthy respect for cultural differences.

Abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to investigate the relation of a series of attitudinal/motivational variables to achievement in French of samples of Canadian and American adult students in an intensive French language program, and to assess the effects of the program on attitudes, motivation, and French proficiency. The results demonstrated an association between an attitudinal/motivational factor, referred to as an integrative motive, and French oral proficiency and reported satisfaction with the program for the sample of 89 Canadian students, but not for the 65 Americans, even though an integrative motive factor was obtained with both samples. Furthermore, both samples evidenced decreases in anxiety and attitudes toward bilingualism, and increases in French proficiency as a result of the program, while the American sample also demonstrated a decreased appreciation of the French Canadian community, and an increased desire to learn French. The results were interpreted as reflecting the role played by attitudes in the language learning situation, but attention was directed toward the significant influence the sociocultural background of the student can have on the nature of this role.

They also cannot receive their education through speechreading, written English, or manual forms of English and subsequently achieve anything comparable to the achievements of their hearing peers. Research is cited to show that native signers do better academically and maintain that advantage throughout their school years. Instruction through a natural sign language is also a benefit, and the transition to teaching through English can be successfully accomplished at about the 5th-grade level. It is also suggested that classroom teachers should seek to give deaf children positive feelings about themselves and their language and allow them to feel pride in the culture of the deaf community.

Abstract = {This research examines the roles of brand cultural symbolism and advertising type (i.e., bilingual vs. host country language) in influencing brand liking among biculturals (people who equally identify with two distinct cultures). Across four experiments, we show that a brand's cultural symbolism (or the degree to which a brand symbolizes a cultural group) moderates the impact of bilingual advertising (vs. English-language advertising) on brand liking among biculturals. Brands low in cultural symbolism can appeal to some types of biculturals by engaging in bilingual advertising, whereas there is no significant improvement in brand liking when bilingual advertising is paired with host-culture symbolic brands. This research also highlights the role of bicultural identity integration (BII), or the degree to which biculturals perceive their mainstream (host) and ethnic (home) identities as compatible (versus incompatible), as a key process mechanism that mediates these effects. We demonstrate that at high levels of BII, biculturals react more favorably to a bilingual ad than an English ad, but only for a less symbolic brand. At low levels of BII, advertising type has no significant effect on biculturals' brand evaluations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {For each of 5 tasks, 96 French- and English-Canadian high school students in 8 groups selected which of 5 photographs was being described by either an English Canadian or a French Canadian who spoke English with a distinct accent. Speaker variables were controlled by employing tape-recordings of both speakers who delivered descriptions of the target pictures, and a reading of each other's description. During the communication task, 1/2 the Ss were frustrated by being told that they were performing poorly while the remaining Ss were told that their performance was above average. Following the picture-selection task, Ss judged the personality of the speaker both in terms of the stereotype of French Canadians and evaluation. Ss also rated the performance of the speaker, the E, themselves, and their team. Major results indicate that although communicational efficiency was similar under all conditions, Ss from both ethnic groups rated the French-Canadian speaker's communication as poor relative to that of the English speaker. English Ss perceived the French-Canadian speaker in a manner consistent with the stereotype of French Canadians, while French Ss rated both speakers in this manner.

Abstract = {Tested the hypothesis that the effect of out-group members' speech style on observers' attitudes toward them varies according to observers' norms for in-group and out-group speech. Ethnocentrism and exposure to out-group members were not only expected to affect attitudes directly but to control speech norms, which themselves underlie intergroup perceptions. Language norms, ethnocentrism, attitudes toward Hispanics and Spanish language, and exposure to Hispanics were measured among 48 13-yr-old Anglophone students in a school containing a Spanish bilingual program. Ss responded to speech samples containing Standard English and syntactic, phonemic, and lexical intrusions from Spanish. These varieties had differential effects on normative judgments and evaluations of the speaker. Measures of speech norms had adequate internal and test–retest reliability. More ethnocentric Ss and Ss with less contact with Hispanics showed negative attitudes toward Hispanics generally and toward the speakers specifically. These relationships were partially mediated by speech norms, although both intergroup contact and speech norms made significant independent contributions to the prediction of out-group attitudes. It is concluded that individual differences in speech norms are important to understanding the effect of speech on intergroup attitudes.

It is a combination of imaginary representations of Algerian and French culture as reflected in the 2 parents. These diverse representations of an oedipal nature become intense and ambivalent, and they correspond characteristically to defense mechanisms. Two case studies of Algerian men reflect this development. Ss came from different walks of Algerian life, but both were subjected to family misfortunes and were transferred to France for treatment of depression. In both cases the father was identified with France and the mother with Algeria. This categorization aided recovery in these 2 particular cases.

Abstract = {The Multidimensional Acculturative Stress Inventory (MASI), a 36-item measure that assesses acculturative stress among people of Mexican origin living in the United States, was tested on 331 adolescent (14–20 years of age) high school students (204 female, 127 male) of Mexican origin. Exploratory factor analyses yielded 4 factors: bicultural practices conflict (9 items), Spanish competency pressures (8 items), English competency pressures (8 items), and bicultural self-consciousness (2 items). These factors accounted for 59.5% of the variance and correlated in the expected directions with criterion measures of acculturation and the Psychological General Well-Being Schedule. Bicultural practices conflict and bicultural self-consciousness emerged as the first and fourth factors for adolescents, which differed from the last 2 factors observed in a previous study of adults by Rodriguez, Myers, Mira, Flores, and Garcia-Hernandez (2002)—pressure to acculturate and pressure against acculturation. Comparisons of the MASI factor structures between adolescents and adults also revealed that English competency pressures and Spanish competency pressures played a prominent role for both adolescents in this study and adults in the study by Rodriguez et al. (2002). The congruence and difference in factor structure of the MASI between adolescents and adults indicates that both groups experience acculturative stress because of English- and Spanish-language competency pressures, but adolescents differentially experience difficulties in negotiating between American and Latino practices and identities. The results highlight the importance of assessing acculturative stress from both Latino and American culture and recognizing the varying levels of these sources of acculturative stress by generation.

Abstract = {The intricate interactions between language and culture shape bilingual and bicultural individuals' psychological responses to social contexts. Language carries cultural scripts, ideals, and practices, which can be activated by situational cues. In the process of managing two acquired languages, bilinguals shift their self‐perception and self‐presentation to accommodate the prototypical norms characteristic of the culture being primed by language use. Cultural mindset can explain such language priming effects. In the process of negotiating two intersecting cultures, integrating bicultural identities is central to psychological adjustment among individuals experiencing immigration‐based and globalization‐based acculturation, whereas bilingual or trilingual competence is important to sojourners' adjustment. The present paper reviews empirical work along these lines of research and suggests that it is possible for alternation and integration to coexist within the same individuals who integrate their bicultural identities and alternate their behavioural responses.

Data analysis resulted in 8 primary themes and 14 subthemes. Results revealed that breasts as a gender marker, gender identity, the breast/chest-gender identity relationship, SMW subtype identity, and both the presence of and resistance to heteronormative beauty codes are the principal factors involved in SMW’s bicultural breasted experience and beauty standard negotiation.

Abstract = {Extant studies on the links between acculturation and mental and substance use disorders among Asian/Pacific Islanders have been based on the assumption that acculturation is a homogeneous construct. However, emerging evidence suggests that the various components of acculturation do not manifest independently, but rather cluster in ways that reflect distinct profiles. We employ data on Asian/Pacific Islanders from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n = 968). Latent profile analysis is used to identify acculturation subgroups on the basis of indicator variables related to cultural identification, language ability and preference, and social engagement. Subsequently, the distribution of outcome variables in the domains of DSM disorders (lifetime history of clinical, personality, and substance use disorders) is examined across latent subgroups. We identified a 5-class solution: Class 1: Separated (12.91%), Class 2: Partial Bilingual/Bicultural (30.06%), Class 3: English Dominant/Asian Oriented (12.29%), Class 4: Full Bilingual/Bicultural (19.42%) and Class 5: Assimilated (25.31%). The highest rates of clinical disorders were observed among members of the 2 classes characterized by a strong preference for the use of the English language (Classes 3 and 5). The highest prevalence of nicotine (12%) and illicit drug use (15%) disorders was observed among members of the Assimilated class. Consistent with prior research, findings suggest that risk of morbidity is greater among more acculturated individuals; however, findings also suggest that an important level of nuance can be observed with respect to acculturative subtypes identified on the basis of cultural identification, language ability and preference, and social engagement.

A path analysis indicated that higher cultural stress scores predicted higher levels of all outcomes. These effects were consistent across genders, but varied by study site. Specifically, higher cultural stress scores increased depressive symptoms among participants in Miami, but not in Los Angeles.

Abstract = {Acculturation plays a critical role in the adjustment of Asian Americans, as a large proportion of them are immigrants in the US. However, little is known about how acculturation influences Asian American adolescents’ academic trajectories over time. Using a longitudinal sample of 444 Chinese American families (54 % female children), the current study explored the effect of mothers’, fathers’, and adolescents’ individual acculturation profiles and parent–child acculturation dissonance on adolescents’ academic trajectories from 8th to 12th grade. Academic performance was measured by grade point average (GPA), and by standardized test scores in English language arts (ELA) and Math every year. Latent growth modeling analyses showed that adolescents with a Chinese-oriented father showed faster decline in GPA, and Chinese-oriented adolescents had lower initial ELA scores. Adolescents whose parents had American-oriented acculturation profiles tended to have lower initial Math scores. These results suggest that Chinese and American profiles may be disadvantageous for certain aspects of academic performance, and bicultural adolescents and/or adolescents with bicultural parents are best positioned to achieve across multiple domains. In terms of the role of parent–child acculturation dissonance on academic trajectories, the current study highlighted the importance of distinguishing among different types of dissonance. Adolescents who were more Chinese-oriented than their parents tended to have the lowest initial ELA scores, and adolescents experiencing more normative acculturation dissonance (i.e., who were more American-oriented than their parents) had the highest initial ELA scores. No effects of parent–child acculturation dissonance were observed for GPAs or standardized Math scores. Altogether, the current findings add nuances to the current understanding of acculturation and adolescent adjustment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {As the world is increasingly globalized, more and more families now reside in a society culturally differing from their ethnic origin and thus face a bicultural environment. Ethnic minority families exemplify this situation. What values do parents from these families prefer when they socialize their children? To answer this question, the present research examines an extension of the intersubjective model of value transmission. In two studies conducted in Hong Kong, it was found that when constructing their value socialization preference, ethnic minority parent participants emphasized not only values they personally endorsed but also values they perceived to be normative in the settlement society and the ethnic society, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that the reference to these dual sets of perceived norms was a function of the participants’ plans about their children’s future destination: They were more likely to refer to values of a society when they to a larger extent expected that their children would reside in that society in future. The participants’ ethnic identity played a significant role too: The reference to perceived norms in the ethnic society was particularly pronounced among those who strongly identified with their ethnic group. Taken together, this extended model represents a useful tool for researchers to examine the intricate dynamics in bicultural and even multicultural families’ value socialization practice. It also offers insights for the understanding of various culture-related psychological issues, including behavioral influence of perceived cultural norms, cultural transmission, and effects of globalization.

Abstract = {Nowadays, globalization is connected with the emergence and reconstruction of new identities. For instance, the migration process implies the generation of new forms of identity, questioning the traditional homogeneous and static notions of identity. In this regard, the term "transnational identity" or "bicultural identity" has been suggested for these people that live in between two cultural frameworks and has to establish a dialogue between the country of origin ("there") and the host country ("here"). This study shows the bicultural and multiple nature of ten immigrant life stories. These narratives illustrate how bicultural and multilingual skills become part of the self definition through the appropriation of cultural voices that manage the origin and host lifestyles, building hybrid and multiple identities that preserve certain ties with the origin society and take certain forms of life of the new culture and society. The novelty embodied in this work is the qualitative approach taken in the research. Most of the literature on transnational identity and transnationalism are based on theoretical discussions or quantitative data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Purpose: We sought to determine the extent to which initial levels and over-time trajectories of cultural stressors (discrimination, negative context of reception, and bicultural stress) predicted well-being, internalizing symptoms, conduct problems, and health risk behaviors among recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents. Addressing this research objective involved creating a latent factor for cultural stressors, establishing invariance for this factor over time, estimating a growth curve for this factor over time, and examining the effects of initial levels (intercepts) and trajectories (slopes) of cultural stressors on adolescent outcomes. Methods: A sample of 302 recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents in Miami (median of 1 year in the United States at baseline) and Los Angeles (median of 3 years in the United States at baseline) was recruited from public schools and assessed six times over a 3-year period. Results: Perceived discrimination, context of reception, and bicultural stress loaded onto a latent factor at each of the first five timepoints. A growth curve conducted on this factor over the first five timepoints significantly predicted lower self-esteem and optimism, more depressive symptoms, greater aggressive behavior and rule breaking, and increased likelihood of drunkenness and marijuana use. Conclusions: The present results may be important in designing interventions for Hispanic immigrant children and adolescents, including those within the present wave of unaccompanied child migrants. Results indicate targeting cultural stressors in interventions may have potential to improve well-being and decrease externalizing behaviors and substance use within this population.

Abstract = {This article presents a case study of a Korean American student organization described as “struggling” by student leaders and administrators. Student leaders blamed themselves; however, I shift from an evaluative and utilitarian approach to ethnic student organizations to an analysis of ethnic student organizations (ESOs) as sites for learning about bicultural students. I use the methodology of case study and the conceptual framework of critical biculturalism to identify 2 factors that impacted the organization: essentialized and, at the same time, uncertain notions of Korean culture; and the influence of a majority Korean American evangelical church. Taking these into account, I find that students’ leadership of the organization may be an expression of their “tactical responses” as bicultural beings. Ultimately, this case study reveals that struggling ESOs should not be written off and offers a critical biculturalist approach to how students of color make sense of and live out the complexities and contradictions of identity, culture, and power.

Abstract = {One of the key challenges of today’s multicultural schools is the educational gap between immigrant and native youth. By focusing on the Turkish second-generation and natives in Belgium, Sweden, Austria and Germany, this paper aims to describe and explain the educational gap between immigrants and natives with a social psychological approach. (1) In describing the educational gap, longitudinal and comparative analyses in the four European countries indicated a widening gap between immigrant and native schools careers. Even Turkish second-generation students who started at the academic schools are less likely than similar natives to stay on and continue beyond secondary education. To explain this gap, this paper develops an explanatory approach from social identity theory and identity threat research. (2) The quality of intergroup relations, specifically intergroup friendships and teacher support, enhances immigrant school success via reducing identity threat. In contrast, discrimination undermines immigrant school adjustment. (3) Social identity strategies play a key role so that a bicultural identity increases vulnerability to identity threat in schools, where bicultural students are least successful in the presence of discrimination and under situationally-induced stereotype threat. (4) Segregation undermines school success and adjustment via reducing intergroup friendship and increasing discrimination. However, highly-segregated schools, where immigrants are the numerical majority, protect them from discrimination. (5) In hierarchically-stratified school systems like Germany, immigrant students are less successful than in less stratified schools like Sweden. This review paper underlines the significance of an explanatory approach from social identity threat and intergroup relations for understanding immigrant school success.

Abstract = {This chapter addresses the assessment of the social, emotional, and behavioral functioning of bilingual and bicultural children, including those native to the United States and those who have recently arrived in the country. This diverse group has significant differences both within the group and in comparison with English-speaking children native to the United States. These differences are often found in the domains most influenced by culture and are critical to understanding social and emotional functioning (e.g., languages spoken, acculturation, educational experiences, family structures, access to social support). This makes the social–emotional assessment of these children an extraordinarily complex task. Although these differences are substantial, it is important to remember that they also coexist with significant human commonalities (Achenbach et al., 2008). In this chapter, we frame the assessment of social, emotional, and behavioral functioning as an assessment of mental health rather than just as social, emotional, and behavioral problems. A comprehensive assessment of mental health in lieu of evaluation of psychopathology includes an understanding of strengths, resources, and resilience in addition to symptoms and problems. We address the challenges presented in understanding the social–emotional strengths and needs of bilingual and bicultural children and provide suggestions that reflect best practices in conducting social and emotional assessments of these children. This chapter pays special attention to school-based practice. This emphasis builds on two important aspects of schools and mental health. First, to the extent that children receive mental health services at all, the majority receive them in schools (Rones & Hoagwood, 2000). Second, school is where children have the most contact with the adults who will notice social, emotional, or behavioral difficulties and provide assistance. This role of schools as places where children in need can be first identified and as places where they are most likely to receive the services they need is especially important for immigrant youth, who often have less access to health care through other resources.

For decades, studies have outlined contrasting conceptions of creativity across cultures or emphasized the role of the cultural context in the development, expression, and assessment of creativity. In this chapter, the authors discuss the development of creativity in light of cross-cultural, bicultural, and multicultural studies after presenting a general overview of creativity as a field of investigation in psychology, including a general definition and related "cultural variations" of its conception.

Abstract = {Purpose: Recent research suggests that acculturation is a multifaceted construct with implications for substance use among Hispanics. However, few, if any, studies examining profiles of acculturation have been conducted using national samples. Moreover, no cluster-based studies have examined how acculturation relates to discrimination and substance use disorders among Hispanics in the United States. Methods: The present study, employing Wave 2 data on Hispanics (n = 6,359) from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions, aims to address these gaps. We use latent profile analysis to identify profiles of acculturation among Hispanics in the United States and, in turn, examine the relationships between membership in these profiles and experiences of discrimination and the prevalence of substance use disorders. Results: A five-class solution was the optimal modeling of the data. Classes were identified as Class 1: Spanish-dominant/strongly separated (17 %), Class 2: Spanish-dominant/separated (18 %), Class 3: bilingual/bicultural (33 %), Class 4: English-dominant/bicultural (16 %), and Class 5: English-dominant/assimilated (16 %). Bilingual/bicultural Hispanics (Class 3) reported the highest prevalence of discrimination (31 %). Spanish-language dominant Hispanics (Classes 1 and 2) reported the lowest prevalence of substance use disorders. Significant differences in the prevalence of substance use disorders were observed between the bilingual/bicultural (Class 3) and English-dominant/assimilated classes (Class 5), but no differences were noted between the two English-dominant classes (Classes 4 and 5). Conclusions: Study findings indicate that acculturation is heterogeneous in its expression among Hispanics and suggest that Hispanics who maintain their Spanish-language capacity are at a substantially lower risk for a variety of substance use disorders.

Abstract = {Identity integration among bicultural individuals refers to the perception that their two cultural identities are compatible. Previous research has shown that identity integration is likely to lead to enhanced creativity. However, this research was conducted among first‐ and second‐generation immigrants, but not among mixed‐race individuals. The current research examined identity integration and creativity among mixed‐race individuals. We also explored the role of integrated identity experiences at home. We found that identity integration was related to increases in creativity; and this was partly mediated via integrated identity experiences at home. Our findings suggest that positive bicultural experiences at home may create a context for the individual to integrate their biracial identities; and this is ultimately beneficial for creativity.

Abstract = {Four studies tested whether cultural values moderate the content of gender stereotypes, such that male stereotypes more closely align with core cultural values (specifically, individualism vs. collectivism) than do female stereotypes. In Studies 1 and 2, using different measures, Americans rated men as less collectivistic than women, whereas Koreans rated men as more collectivistic than women. In Study 3, bicultural Korean Americans who completed a survey in English about American targets rated men as less collectivistic than women, whereas those who completed the survey in Korean about Korean targets did not, demonstrating how cultural frames influence gender stereotype content. Study 4 established generalizability by reanalyzing Williams and Best’s (1990) cross-national gender stereotype data across 26 nations. National individualism–collectivism scores predicted viewing collectivistic traits as more—and individualistic traits as less—stereotypically masculine. Taken together, these data offer support for the cultural moderation of gender stereotypes hypothesis, qualifying past conclusions about the universality of gender stereotype content.

The book is very loosely divided into six chapters that focus on defining borderlands, colonization and decolonization, new ways of thinking of the borderlands, trauma, healing, and a final catchall chapter. The book succeeds by bringing the reader’s attention to the vast multiplicity of Latin@ circumstances (Latin@ is a construction that resists the gendered Spanish endings yet avoids the complexity of Latino/a), especially when one considers the innumerable ways in which bicultural identity is lived by Latin@ people in the United States and around the world. The author calls this multifaceted bicultural existence living on the borderlands. Hernández-Wolfe provides interesting examples of lives that are lived across lines. Stories are connected to historical and social conditions. This book teaches about broad political and social circumstances that affect people (e.g., prejudice against homosexuality in the Latin@ community), but not much about how one can expect these issues to affect Latin@ people psychologically.

Using a supplemental item from the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale, we classified participants into one of three acculturative statuses: Asian-Identified (n = 56), Western-Identified (n = 20), and Bicultural-Identified (n = 20). We used Ryff's (1989) Scales of Psychological Well-Being as a comprehensive measure of well-being, in addition to other commonly used indicators of well-being such as life satisfaction and depressed mood. We hypothesized that Bicultural-Identified individuals would show greater well-being relative to Asian-Identified and Western-Identified individuals as a result of these latter groups experiencing acculturative stress and bicultural stress, respectively. Results of a priori contrast tests largely confirmed our hypothesis, revealing the predicted pattern among four of six subscales of subjective well-being.

Abstract = {Despite the salience of behavioral autonomy and independence to parent–child interactions during middle adolescence, little is known about parenting processes pertinent to youth autonomy development for Latino families. Among a diverse sample of 684 Latino-origin parent–adolescent dyads in Houston, Texas, this study examines how parents’ cultural orientations are associated directly and indirectly, through parental beliefs, with parenting practices giving youth behavioral autonomy and independence. Informed by social domain theory, the study’s parenting constructs pertain to youth behaviors in an “ambiguously personal” domain—activities that adolescents believe are up to youth to decide, but which parents might argue require parents’ supervision, knowledge, and/or decision-making. Results for latent profile analyses of parents’ cultural identity across various facets of acculturation indicate considerable cultural heterogeneity among Latino parents. Although 43 % of parents have a Latino cultural orientation, others represent Spanish-speaking/bicultural (21 %), bilingual/bicultural (15 %), English-speaking/bicultural (15 %), or US (6 %) cultural orientations. Structural equation modeling results indicate that bilingual/bicultural, English-speaking/bicultural, and US-oriented parents report less emphasis on the legitimacy of parental authority and younger age expectations for youth to engage in independent behaviors than do Latino-oriented parents. Parental beliefs endorsing youth’s behavioral independence and autonomy, in turn, are associated with less stringent parental rules (parental report), less parental supervision (parental and youth report), and more youth autonomy in decision-making (parental and youth report). Evidence thus supports the idea that the diverse cultural orientations of Latino parents in the US may result in considerable variations in parenting processes pertinent to Latino adolescents’ development.

Abstract = {Objective: To develop a deeper understanding of how jealousy escalates to physical dating violence within Mexican American adolescent romantic relationships. Method: Using grounded theory, 20 focus groups of self-identified Mexican American adolescents (N = 64; 15–17 years old) were analyzed by level of acculturation and gender. Results: Three distinct “jealous” typologies resulting in dating violence were identified: normative jealousy (typically highly acculturated or bicultural male and female adolescents), jealous and possessive (typically bicultural male adolescents), and jealous and accepting of dating violence norms (typically low acculturated male adolescents). Across types, jealousy was upheld within a peer culture that constructed loose definitions of cheating behavior and was identified as the most salient relationship issue that held the potential to escalate to extreme forms of anger and resulting violence. Conclusions: Adolescents’ behaviors within their romantic relationships are embedded within a peer environment that legitimizes and fosters relationship jealousy. Jealousy is a particularly salient and troublesome relationship issue among acculturating Mexican American adolescents, who struggle as it is normatively experienced yet initiates processes leading to partner violence. Dating violence preventative interventions need to target both culturally influenced intrapersonal factors (e.g., communication and anger management skills, acceptance of dating violence) as well as peer norms (e.g., partner monitoring) to effect change among Mexican American youth.

Abstract = {This study aimed to better understand how minor mental health problems (MMPs) are perceived by well-educated urban dwellers in China who are influenced by Western values. Urban China is a rapidly changing society in which traditional Chinese culture and Western thought coexist. As a result, the established processes of interdependent self-appraisal have been challenged and a sense of a bicultural self has developed among a growing proportion of the population. The fieldwork for this study included interviews and observations. The results are derived mainly from interviews with professional practitioners, students, and lay people from three urban sites. One of the main findings was that respondents who referred to traditional and collectivistic Chinese values tended not to label MMPs as psychiatric disorders or illnesses but as challenges in daily life and relationships strain. While the Western medical model of MMPs considers them a form of illness, they were not viewed in this way in traditional collectivistic China in the past, even among educated urban dwellers. However, the urban and educated Chinese who have developed a stronger sense of a bicultural self are now more likely to perceive and deal with MMPs from a Western viewpoint.

Abstract = {Background: Recent immigrants have better mental health than the natives (‘immigration advantage’). Biculturals have better mental health than the monoculturals (‘biculturalism paradox’). Material: Mexican immigrants have lower rates of psychopathology than the US population. This is less true for Cubans and not true for Puerto Ricans. The ‘advantage’ also occurs in other groups. Biculturals have better mental health and endorse both cultures. Discussion: The theory of demoralization predicts that borrowing values from both cultures and applying them judiciously are more conducive to mental health than indiscriminately subscribing to either culture. Conclusion: The findings are consistent with the theory of demoralization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Drawing from a theory of bicultural family functioning 2 models were tested to examine the longitudinal effects of acculturation-related variables on adolescent health risk behaviors and depressive symptoms (HRB/DS) mediated by caregiver and adolescent reports of family functioning. One model examined the effects of caregiver-adolescent acculturation discrepancies in relation to family functioning and HRB/DS. A second model examined the individual effects of caregiver and adolescent acculturation components in relation to family functioning and HRB/DS. A sample of 302 recently immigrated Hispanic caregiver-child dyads completed measures of Hispanic and U.S. cultural practices, values, and identities at baseline (predictors); measures of family cohesion, family communications, and family involvement 6 months postbaseline (mediators); and only adolescents completed measures of smoking, binge drinking, inconsistent condom use, and depressive symptoms 1 year postbaseline (outcomes). Measures of family cohesion, family communications, and family involvement were used to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to estimate the fit of a latent construct for family functioning. Key findings indicate that (a) adolescent acculturation components drove the effect of caregiver-adolescent acculturation discrepancies in relation to family functioning; (b) higher levels of adolescent family functioning were associated with less HRB/DS, whereas higher levels of caregiver family functioning were associated with more adolescent HRB/DS; (c) and only adolescent reports of family functioning mediated the effects of acculturation components and caregiver-adolescent acculturation discrepancies on HRB/DS.

Abstract = {The increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among Latino children, later diagnosis, limited access to bicultural specialist support, and worsened health outcomes when compared to non‐Latinos points to the need for a culturally relevant parent education intervention. This pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a culturally derived intervention, Parents Taking Action, for 19 Spanish‐speaking mothers of children with ASD. This study introduces the Promotora de Salud Model of intervention delivery to the autism field. A mixed‐methods design including one group pre‐ and posttest design and focus groups was used to evaluate the outcomes of PTA. We found that the intervention was both feasible to implement and acceptable to participants. We also found significant increases in empowerment oriented outcomes for parents between pre‐ and posttest suggesting that the intervention is promising.

Abstract = {Prior studies suggest that people often search insufficiently in sequential-search tasks compared with the predictions of benchmark optimal strategies that maximize expected payoff. However, those studies were mostly conducted in individualist Western cultures; Easterners from collectivist cultures, with their higher susceptibility to escalation of commitment induced by sunk search costs, could exhibit a reversal of this undersearch bias by searching more than optimally, but only when search costs are high. We tested our theory in four experiments. In our pilot experiment, participants generally undersearched when search cost was low, but only Eastern participants oversearched when search cost was high. In Experiments 1 and 2, we obtained evidence for our hypothesized effects via a cultural-priming manipulation on bicultural participants in which we manipulated the language used in the program interface. We obtained further process evidence for our theory in Experiment 3, in which we made sunk costs nonsalient in the search task—as expected, cross-cultural effects were largely mitigated.

Abstract = {Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, little is known about how Muslims, as a minority group, cope with the challenges associated with engaging their religious practices in a predominantly non-Islamic context. This study aims to investigate how international Muslim science students dealt with the difficulties they faced in their religious practices in a foreign context, and specifically in their research laboratories and in the wider Taiwanese society with its pluralistic spiritual beliefs. Fourteen male Muslim graduate students from Indonesia were recruited to participate in a qualitative interview. In terms of conventional content analysis, their adjustment issues were related to their religious issues, including gender roles both inside and outside of the laboratory, inconvenient practices relating to prayer needs, and eating halal foods and having to face social discrimination off campus. Two types of major adaptation strategies were identified for dealing with such struggles, including religious coping through their Islamic beliefs and bicultural connections. Their major concerns about religious practices (e.g., praying 5 times per day) were resolved by communicating their needs directly with their laboratory classmates and advisors; however, they navigated the gender boundaries in the laboratory both subtly and inwardly through their Islamic beliefs. The practical implications regarding counseling and education are discussed both in a local and a global context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Terror management theory posits that cultural worldviews provide protection against death-related anxiety. To the extent that worldviews often encompass competing beliefs, the present research investigated the effect of the salience of an incompatibility between worldview elements. French nationals of second- or third-immigrant generation (N = 193) were exposed to compatible or incompatible aspects of their cultural identities and then induced to contemplate their own death or a neutral topic. Participants reminded of their mortality renounced their ethnic identity more in the cultural incompatibility condition, and this effect was confined to those who initially presented an integrated (or bicultural) identity. Mortality salience led to monoculturalism striving when bicultural participants considered incompatible aspects of both their cultures, hence verifying the importance of upholding a strong and unwavering cultural worldview to cope with death awareness. The role of death-thoughts accessibility and religious attitudes following participants’ efforts to shore up their cultural worldview is discussed.

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on the intersection of environmental displacement and language education. The devastating earthquake in Haiti brought this intersection into sharp focus as large numbers of Haitians have been forced to migrate internally (causing new problems of access to potable water, sustainable food sources and safe habitats, which portend repeated environmental displacement) and internationally, particularly to the U.S. As the former often leads to the latter, this chapter examines the growing and potential presence of environmentally displaced people—also called "climate refugees," "ecological refugees," "environmental diaspora," "environmental migrants," and "environmental refugees"—among the English language learner population and, thereby, the impact of climate change, biospheric degradation, environmental dislocation and sustainability in bilingual-bicultural education curriculum theorizing. Specifically, I examine the issue of environmental dislocation as identity in bilingual-bicultural education and introduce Daisaku Ikeda's (1928-present) educational philosophy as an Eastern, transformative eco-educational approach to this complex and developing issue. As I have elsewhere both reviewed extant literature on environmental displacement and examined Ikeda's United Nations Decade proposal at length, those discussions will not be reiterated here (see Goulah, 2010a, 2010b). Instead, I focus on three of Ikeda's views as Eastern approaches required at this time of environmental and linguistic dislocation: cosmological identity as ecological selfhood, abstraction at the root of environmental and linguistic displacement, and value-creating pedagogy as a new current in bilingual-bicultural education. First, however, I examine the state of environmental displacement and its interrelation with English language learners in the United States.

We also tested whether bicultural self-efficacy moderated the relationship between acculturative stress and mental health. Finally, we examined whether generational status moderated the impact of racial and cultural predictors of mental health by testing our model across immigrant and U.S.-born samples. Results indicated that our hypothesized structural model represented a good fit to the total sample data. While racism-related stress, acculturative stress, and bicultural self-efficacy were significant predictors of mental health in the total sample analyses, our generational analyses revealed a differential predictive pattern across generational status. Finally, we found that the buffering effect of bicultural self-efficacy on the relationship between acculturative stress and mental health was significant for U.S.-born individuals only.

Each of the women featured in this chapter considers herself to be socially and culturally proficient both within immigrant Bosnian and mainstream U.S. cultures; each is also academically successful and professionally ambitious. In their own words, the young women relate their lived experiences in U.S. culture and their processes of acculturation and identity construction. The analysis highlights the conceptions and reconstruction of cultural and religious identity among these women, who all identify themselves as ethnically Bosnian and religiously Muslim. Narratives and analysis also discuss the role of race, language, and cultural distance in the women's identity construction process. Each adolescent woman idealizes a bicultural identity in which she is able to step between both Bosnian and U.S, cultural worlds. The women describe various degrees of success with this cultural code-switching and explain their processes of highlighting or downplaying their religious and cultural identity in various social situation. While their experiences in U.S. schools and social contexts vary, all the women are conscious of various influences on their religions and cultural identities and ascribe personal agency to their bicultural identity construction.

Abstract = {This chapter reviews several key aspects of immigrant youth development within an ecological framework. In contrast to risk/deficit models of minority development, we draw from perspectives emphasizing resiliency and highlight research on developmental competencies among immigrant youth. Although growing rapidly in numbers, immigrant youth continue to be an understudied and underserved child population in the United States. With an absence of political representation, unclear legal statuses or gateways to citizenship, and lacking access to social, educational, and medical services, many immigrant families and children face unique challenges to a healthy everyday life in the United States. These challenges include racism and discrimination, which can negatively impact the development of any child regardless of their culture of origin or family socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, many immigrant children and adolescents thrive developmentally in spite of these social and economic barriers, and researchers are documenting these noteworthy pathways of success. In particular, there is increasing discussion around the "immigrant paradox," a phenomenon in which the most recently immigrated youth (who are also most likely to reside in poverty, have parents with low-wage work, and experience barriers to social services) exhibit superior educational and behavioral outcomes when compared to more highly acculturated same-ethnicity peers (Garcia Coll & Marks, 2011). Given these recent trends emphasizing the developmental promise of immigrant youth, this chapter reviews recent research on several developmental competencies particularly salient for immigrant children. These include the developmental tasks of becoming bicultural in social and family relationships, developing healthy multiethnic identities, and budding cognitive and social skills that yield facility in multiple languages (i.e., bilingualism). We contend that developing these competencies is of singular importance for supporting the overall healthy growth and development of youth in immigrant families, and supporting them should be a focus of research and intervention efforts moving forward. To situate these developmental competencies in context, ecological perspectives explicating child-environment interactions within social settings also frame this review (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006). We focus on research capturing microsystems, the everyday social settings including home, school, peer, and neighborhoods, that shape the above-mentioned developmental competencies. We focus on microsystems primarily because a relatively large proportion of context-related immigrant youth development research resides at the microsystem level (compared to direct measurement and consideration of macrosystem or exosystem research). We also attend to research of the mesosystem when possible, capturing transactions involving immigrant youth across multiple microsystem settings. Strong alliances across social settings allow immigrant children to access and coordinate their varied sources of developmental support and promote their own and their family's well-being (Garcia Coll & Marks, 2009). Parent-school involvement interactions, for example, are commonly studied mesosystem processes that are known to widely support children's and adolescents' academic successes (Cheung & Sin-Sze, 2012). By emphasizing interactions among social settings, in this chapter we hope to highlight opportunities for public policies and interventions that might support developmental competencies among immigrant children and their families, By situating our review of the bicultural, ethnic identity, and bilingual developmental competencies so vital to the health and development of immigrant youth in these ecological settings, we hope to stimulate ideas for future research that may expand our appreciation for and understanding of immigrant youth-context interactions.

The second section will address an additional set of studies on bicultural identity orientations and the code-switching process strategies that individuals would likely use in diverse Intercultural and intergroup conflict encounters. The third section will explicate the multicultural identity attunement perspective and offer some application directions stemming from the various identity-based frameworks. The fourth section will emphasize the intentional steps needed to cultivate a mindful identity transformation process and also offer several directions for future research concerning identity-based conflict issues.

Abstract = {Previous studies reported mixed findings on the relationship between acculturation and health status among Asian Americans due to different types of acculturation measures used or different Asian subgroups involved in various studies. We aim to fill the gap by applying multiple measures of acculturation in a diverse sample of Asian subgroups. A cross sectional study was conducted among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese Americans in Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area to examine the association between health status and acculturation using multiple measures including the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation (SL-ASIA) scale, clusters based on responses to SL-ASIA, language preference, length of stay, age at arrival in the United Sates and self-identity. Three clusters (Asian (31%); Bicultural (47%); and American (22%)) were created by using a two-step hierarchical method and Bayesian Information Criterion values. Across all the measures, more acculturated individuals were significantly more likely to report good health than those who were less acculturated after adjusting for covariates. Specifically, those in the American cluster were 3.8 times (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.2, 6.6) more likely and those in the Bicultural cluster were 1.7 times more likely (95% CI: 1.1, 2.4) to report good health as compared to those in the Asian cluster. When the conventional standardized SL-ASIA summary score (range: -1.4 to 1.4) was used, a one point increase was associated with 2.2 times greater odds of reporting good health (95% CI: 1.5, 3.2). However, the interpretation may be challenging due to uncertainty surrounding the meaning of a one point increase in SLASIA summary score. Among all the measures used, acculturation clusters better approximated the acculturation process and provided us with a more accurate test of the association in the population. Variables included in this measure were more relevant for our study sample and may have worked together to capture the multifaceted acculturation process.

Abstract = {Although Muslims have a significant presence at American universities, they are largely ignored by campus policies and resources and may find it difficult to reconcile their university experience with their religious values and practices. Using bicultural acculturation as a theoretical lens along with interviews and document analysis, this exploratory study of ten Muslim students at one university suggests that students have acquired the tools to successfully navigate membership in both American and Muslim cultural groups, evaluating each setting before invoking a particular identity. However, the acculturation process does not require any change by the institution. While participants described a need to adopt situationally-appropriate behaviors, they did not expect accommodation from the university or their peers.

Abstract = {Negotiating racial politics in the United States is a rapidly transforming and dynamic matter. As a result, racial/ethnic socialization (R/ES) measurement must match this transformation to reflect the current processes utilized by Black Americans to manage racial conflict. We describe the scale construction of the Cultural and Racial Experiences of Socialization (CARES), a multidimensional assessment of R/ES based on Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization theory. Additionally, we tested the CARES for its relation with gender and perceived racism. Utilizing a national sample of 373 Black college students, Exploratory Factor Analysis revealed the CARES to have 35 items and a 5 factor-solution. The CARES demonstrated strong overall internal consistency and its factors had moderate to strong internal consistency coefficients. The CARES factors allude to the complex role of R/ES as a social cognitive strategy for managing racial conflict. New concepts include both racism and bicultural coping strategies. We move beyond traditional concepts of cultural mistrust, which focus on a suspicion of the motives of White people, with the Racial Stereotyping factor that includes messages conveying cynical views of other Black people based on social class, gender and colorism. Gender differences in R/ES indicate that parents may perceive the consequences of racial conflict and miscues to be more dismal for their sons than their daughters. Interaction effects were found between R/ES and perceived racism. Family practitioners can use the findings to guide parents that are vacillating on the importance of discussing racial hierarchies with their children.

Our study used a community-based approach to better understand factors that influence breast and cervical cancer screening among Hmong women. Objective: This article shares lessons learned during the process of developing and conducting qualitative research with a Hmong community with limited experience with research. Method: We conducted 17 key informant and 84 in-depth interviews with Hmong women and men. Research team discussions, insights from Hmong research team members, input from our Community Advisory Committee, and project documents were sources of information about the process of conducting research in this community. Results: Lessons learned concern including a cultural insider as an investigator; building community partnerships and support; establishing and working with a community advisory committee; hiring and training bilingual, bicultural staff; and using culturally appropriate materials and methods in a small, kinship-based community. We used multiple strategies to ensure that this study was conducted in a culturally appropriate manner. Conclusion: The lessons learned from our experiences can provide guidance to researchers on methodological and practical issues in conducting research with the Hmong and can inform future research with the Hmong and other similar underserved populations.

Abstract = {This paper reports the identity negotiation experiences of first, second and 1.5 generation Chinese immigrants in Australia. Integration into the Australian larger society requires first generation immigrants to learn or improve their English language skills and adapt to the host cultural practices to the extent possible so that they can be accepted as a member of the mainstream society. Second and 1.5 generation immigrants have the advantage of being well-equipped with knowledge of the host cultural practices and English language skills as they were either born in the host country or migrated at a young age. However, as they grow up, they realize that it is not possible for people with Chinese ancestry to be 100% “Australian”, no matter how well they speak the English language or how closely they follow the Australian way of life. Their physical appearance sets them apart from the Anglo-Australians at first sight. Consequently, they also need to perform to the expectations of both cultural groups, and this is what they do on a daily basis. Drawing upon data from 35 semi-structured interviews with first, second and 1.5 generation Chinese in Australia, this study illustrates that shifted identity, rather than blended identity is favoured by majority of respondents as they navigate through the bicultural environment to “fit in” different contexts. The Findings from this study highlight that identification with a culture does not necessarily suggest belonging to that culture. Identification and belonging are not the same. Those findings are discussed in light of implication for theories on identities and acculturation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: This study examined sources of indigenous identity among urban American Indian youth that map the three theoretical dimensions of a model advanced by Markstrom: identification (tribal and ethnic heritage), connection (through family and reservation ties), and involvement in traditional culture and spirituality. Method: Data came from self-administered questionnaires completed by 208 urban American Indian students from five middle schools in a large metropolitan area in the Southwest. Results: Descriptive statistics showed most youth were connected to multiple indicators on all three dimensions of indigenous identity: native parental heritage, native best friends, past and current reservation connections, involvement with cultural practices, tribal language and spirituality, and alignment with native and mainstream cultural orientations. A latent class analysis identified five classes. There were two larger groups, one with strong native heritage and the highest levels of enculturation, and another that was more bicultural in orientation. The remaining three groups were smaller and about equal in size: a highly acculturated group with mixed parental ethnic heritage, those who had strong native heritage but were culturally disengaged, and a group with some mixed ethnic heritage that was low on indicators of enculturation. Evidence for the validity of the latent classes came from significant variations across the classes in scores on an American Indian ethnic identity (modified Phinney) scale, the students’ open-ended descriptions of the main sources of their indigenous identities, and the better academic grades of classes that were more culturally engaged. Conclusions: Despite the challenges of maintaining cultural identities in the urban environment, most youth in this sample expressed a strong sense of indigenous identity, claimed personal and parental tribal heritage, remained connected to reservation communities, and actively engaged in Native cultural and spiritual life.

Abstract = {This study examines the literary representation of adopted Chinese girls’ psychological sense of community in Chinese-American communities. Psychological sense of community is defined as the perception that an individual is part of an inclusive social network (Hill, 1996). This sense is multi-dimensional; three specific dimensions are living in a bicultural community, participating in cultural festivals, and replicating birth-country food practices (e.g., Frost, 2008; Mannarini & Fedi, 2009). The researchers identified 37 children’s books that featured portrayals of Chinese girls adopted by U.S. families. A content analysis was conducted to determine the extent that the three dimensions were evident in the books. The analysis was based on concepts drawn from the community psychology literature. All three senses of community dimensions are described, and a fourth dimension (compensatory information/symbol) is identified. This last dimension was consistent with literature about immigrant and adoptive populations. Implications of this study for practice/research are noted.

Abstract = {Context: Latinos experience significant health disparities at the end of life compared with non-Latinos. Objectives: To determine the feasibility of a patient navigator intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for Latino adults with serious illness. Methods: This was a pilot randomized controlled trial that included 64 Latino adults with life-limiting illness randomized to an intervention or a control group. All participants received a packet of linguistically matched materials on palliative care. In addition, intervention participants received up to five home visits from the bilingual, bicultural patient navigator. Visits focused on addressing barriers to palliative care through education, activation, and culturally tailored messaging. Outcomes included feasibility and advance care planning rates, documentation of pain management discussions in the medical record, and hospice utilization. Results: Of the 32 patients randomized to the intervention arm, 81% had at least one home visit (range 1–5) with the patient navigator. Overall, advance care planning was higher in the intervention group (47% [n = 15] vs. 25% [n = 8], P = 0.06), and 79% of intervention participants had a discussion about pain management documented in their medical record vs. 54% of control patients (P = 0.05). Hospice enrollment between the two groups (n = 18 decedents) was similar (n = 7 intervention vs. n = 6 control); length of stay in the intervention group was 36.4 ± 51.6 vs. 19.7 ± 33.6 days for control patients (P = 0.39). Conclusion: A culturally tailored patient navigator intervention was feasible and suggests improved palliative care outcomes for Latinos facing advanced medical illness, justifying a fully powered randomized controlled trial.

Abstract = {The Indian region of Ladakh has recently undergone comprehensive sociocultural changes through the process of acculturation. The present study employs an acculturation psychological framework to assess how two groups of Ladakhi college students navigate through different degrees of exposure to acculturation and how this affects their mental health. Using mixed methods, 292 (age: M = 20.89, SD = 1.66; 64.4% females) respondents were included in the quantitative assessment and 12 participated in semistructured interviews. Analysis revealed that students with less acculturation exposure were more oriented toward ethnic culture and to a greater extent experienced impaired mental health when compared with the sample with more acculturation. Most prevalent among the students (34.2%) was a bicultural orientation, integrating both ethnic and mainstream culture. In general, acculturation orientation was not associated with quantitative measures of depression or anxiety. The qualitative analysis revealed agency and cultural identity to be pivotal factors in the process of reproducing culture and negotiating cultural change.

Abstract = {This study examined the acculturation process with particular attention to how individuals navigate, evaluate, negotiate, adopt, and integrate various cultural aspects. A qualitative approach using in-depth interviews with Americans in Sweden and Swedes in the U.S. was employed to gain a nuanced and in-depth understanding of how the process is experienced at different stages and what role cultural, societal, and interpersonal factors play. Results emerging from a grounded theory analysis revealed a selective process involving identification of cultural differences and evaluation of host-culture aspects as complementary, superior, inferior, necessary, or unnecessary compared to home-culture ones. Culture-specific features are treated as additive, integrative, or mutually exclusive. Host-culture interaction and home-culture contact influence the process in important ways. Home-culture core values are rarely abandoned in favor of host-culture ones and the latter are not simply added. Bicultural competence is achievable; however, retention of a firm home-culture identity is a likely acculturation outcome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed growing research on the experiences of children and youth after migration or resettlement. However, nearly all of this research focuses on children and youth who arrived in the country with their parents. We know little of the unique experiences of refugee youngsters who came to this country without parental company. How do they negotiate the different cultures in the absence of parents? In this article, we draw on in-depth interview data with 19 Sudanese emerging adults who came to the United States as unaccompanied refugee minors to examine issues of acculturation and adaptation. Our findings show that having a strong root in their native culture and identity helped them make good choices, maintain focus, and avoid distractions associated with negative aspects of the U.S. youth culture. Our participants also discussed the importance of learning the new ways. As a result, those who maintained their native culture and combined it with the positive aspect of the U.S. culture were the ones who did best in their adaptation. Our research confirms previous findings on immigrant and refugee youth with parents that a bicultural orientation is the best for adaptation. Our findings also illustrate a more specific and agentic process of cultural appropriation with a flexible orientation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {For bicultural individuals, visual cues of a setting’s cultural expectations can activate associated representations, switching the frames that guide their judgments. Research suggests that cultural cues may affect judgments through automatic priming, but has yet to investigate consequences for linguistic performance. The present studies investigate the proposal that heritage-culture cues hinder immigrants’ second-language processing by priming first-language structures. For Chinese immigrants in the United States, speaking to a Chinese (vs. Caucasian) face reduced their English fluency, but at the same time increased their social comfort, effects that did not occur for a comparison group of European Americans (study 1). Similarly, exposure to iconic symbols of Chinese (vs. American) culture hindered Chinese immigrants’ English fluency, when speaking about both culture-laden and culture-neutral topics (study 2). Finally, in both recognition (study 3) and naming tasks (study 4), Chinese icon priming increased accessibility of anomalous literal translations, indicating the intrusion of Chinese lexical structures into English processing. We discuss conceptual implications for the automaticity and adaptiveness of cultural priming and practical implications for immigrant acculturation and second-language learning.

Age differences were found across the ethnic identity statuses but not for the continuous REI measures. Overall, adolescents placed predominantly at the traditional (identified with indigenous culture) and marginal (neither identified with indigenous nor mainstream culture) ethnic identity statuses with fewer marginal and more bicultural (identified with both indigenous and mainstream cultures) categorized adolescents across the age-range. Traditional students followed by those classified as bicultural evidenced greater REI and adaptive functioning in comparison with marginal and mainstream students. Predicted relationships between REI and adjustment among Canadian First Nation adolescents were supported; findings suggest potential benefits of First Nation communities for REI development.

Abstract = {People living in multicultural environments often encounter situations which require them to acquire different cultural schemas and to switch between these cultural schemas depending on their immediate sociocultural context. Prior behavioral studies show that priming cultural schemas reliably impacts mental processes and behavior underlying self-concept. However, less well understood is whether or not cultural priming affects neurobiological mechanisms underlying the self. Here we examined whether priming cultural values of individualism and collectivism in bicultural individuals affects neural activity in cortical midline structures underlying self-relevant processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Biculturals primed with individualistic values showed increased activation within medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) during general relative to contextual self-judgments, whereas biculturals primed with collectivistic values showed increased response within MPFC and PCC during contextual relative to general self-judgments. Moreover, degree of cultural priming was positively correlated with degree of MPFC and PCC activity during culturally congruent self-judgments. These findings illustrate the dynamic influence of culture on neural representations underlying the self and, more broadly, suggest a neurobiological basis by which people acculturate to novel environments.

Abstract = {When people perceive that they are rejected because of a group membership, identification with that group can increase, a phenomenon known as rejection-identification. Immigrants represent an interesting case for rejection-identification because (a) they can face rejection from both members of the majority group in the host country (e.g., Americans) and their ethnic community (e.g., Mexicans) specifically because of the membership in the other and (b) their ethnic and national identities are tied to different contexts and carry different levels of investment. In a survey of Latino immigrants in the United States, it was found that perceived group-based rejection from Latinos was related to lower ethnic identification and stronger identification with the United States and marginally stronger bicultural identification as Latino-American. Perceived group-based rejection from other Americans was related to stronger disidentification with the United States, but had no relationship to ethnic identification. These effects were independent of feelings of personal acceptance. The application of the rejection-identification model to the case of immigration is discussed.

Abstract = {This article evaluates the psychological processes, discursive practices, and sociopolitical mechanisms underlying the identity reconstruction of Muslim immigrant women in the United States and the Netherlands. Specifically, it focuses on the ways in which Muslim immigrant women who are embedded in both Islamic and Western cultures negotiate their traditional and modern identities and self-representations and construct a coherent self-narrative about their bicultural existence as “Western-Muslim.” The qualitative evidence presented here expands existing theoretical and empirical discussions on biculturalism and acculturation by demonstrating the ways in which contextual factors define the negotiation repertoire that is available to bicultural individuals. The findings of this article also call into question some of the earlier findings on cultural conflict hypothesis, because it shows that successful negotiation of bicultural identities depends not so much on whether the individual perceives these identities and cultures to be compatible with each other, but rather on the availability of a coherent self-narrative of belonging to both cultural worlds.

Abstract = {Chinese, Chinese-Canadian, and Euro-Canadian children 7, 9, and 11 years of age were presented scenarios in which story characters either lied or told the truth to help themselves but harm a collective, or vice versa. Children classified, evaluated, and justified their evaluations of the truthful or untruthful statements in each scenario. Cultural differences emerged in the children’s evaluations but were especially apparent in their justifications. Chinese children rated more positively statements that helped a collective and harmed an individual than vice versa, and they showed concerns for a group over the self when evaluating moral statements, thus reflecting collectivist inclinations. Euro-Canadian children did the reverse, demonstrating individualistic tendencies. Bicultural, Chinese-Canadian, children’s judgments and justifications were situation specific, offering preliminary evidence for the possibility that bicultural individuals shift, at a relatively early age, between cultural frames in their interpretations and evaluations of moral dilemmas, depending upon the context.

Abstract = {Objectives: The present study used a cultural and social cognitive conceptual framework to investigate whether alcohol expectancies and valuations would mediate the associations between specific acculturation orientations and alcohol‐related risk behaviors. Design: The sample comprised 1,527 Hispanic students attending colleges and universities in diverse regions of the United States. Respondents completed self‐report measures of Hispanic and American cultural practices; alcohol expectancies and valuations; and self‐reported frequency of hazardous alcohol use, binge drinking, sexual activity under the influence of alcohol, driving under the influence of alcohol, and riding with a drunk driver. Latent class analysis was used to classify participants into acculturation orientations. Results: Results indicated that acculturation orientations were differentially associated with alcohol‐related risk outcomes, with separated bicultural and low bicultural orientations inversely related to all of the alcohol‐related risk behaviors except for riding with a drunk driver. Negative expectancy valuations were positively associated with endorsement of binge drinking and drunk driving and negative expectancies were negatively associated with binge drinking, drunk driving, and riding with a drunk driver. With the exception of sexual activity under the influence of alcohol, the associations between acculturation orientations and alcohol‐related risk behaviors were partially mediated by positive alcohol expectancies. Conclusions: Our findings provided relevant data that are informative for preventing alcohol and related risk behaviors among Hispanic college students.

Abstract = {This qualitative study explored the identity development process of 11 undocumented college students living in the United States, focusing on how undocumented college students negotiate the interplay of acculturation, ethnic identity, and educational and career pursuits. A semistructured interview protocol was used and data analysis was iterative, consistent with grounded theory methodology. Four major themes emerged from the data: (a) “sewn with two threads” describes the salience of bicultural identity; (b) enhancement of positive attributes as a result of documentation struggles; (c) challenging reflections, addressing the ways in which documentation status challenges one's perception of oneself and the world; and (d) identity formation as an ongoing negotiation, capturing the long-term shifts in understanding of status implications and emotional response to this understanding. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for educators, counseling psychologists, and career counselors.

Feminism for us has not become a separate lens through which we see the world; rather, it has become a tool we can use to blur those borders, facilitating an ease of integration, emphasizing our reality of intersectionality, without guilt or shame or overwhelming confusion. Acquisition of this new lens, this new layer through which we are now able to see the world, has resounded with us in a way that speaks truth, that shows truth. We are continuously on this path toward integrating our identities, crossing the borders without fear or destruction of what little certainty we have obtained as young, single, heterosexual, bicultural, bilingual, Catholic, Latina feminists.

Abstract = {Chen, Heatherton, and Freeman review the unique strategy of longitudinally assessing the neural changes that occur during the acculturation process. This process differs from the typical research strategy of comparing individuals from two unique cultures or using bicultural individuals and priming them with different cultural cues. The authors use this strategy to determine whether longitudinal study of neural responses can predict acculturation better than typical behavioral measures. Neuroimaging studies indicate that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is activated in response to self-judgments in both Western and Eastern cultures and in response to judgments about close others (e.g., one’s mother) in Eastern cultures. Longitudinal analysis showed that Chinese immigrants to the USA who displayed greater acculturation had more activation in this brain region for self-judgments than for judgments about close others. Studies of the reaction to positive emotion expressions of in-group and out-group faces have shown activation of the ventral striatum, a structure in the brain’s reward circuit. Longitudinal study of Chinese graduate students who were in school in the USA showed that higher ventral striatum activity to in-group facial expressions showed more in-group friends on a social networking website. Lower ventral striatum activity to in-group facial expressions showed lower number of in-group friends on a social networking website. The authors conclude by offering several ideas for future research, including using diffuse tensor imaging to investigate white matter integrity changes over time and using more cultural specific cues in experimental protocol.

Abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to describe how pastoral counselors draw on religious and theological studies along with psychological studies. How do counselors bring these distinct disciplines to bear on their counseling practice? This is a question about interdisciplinary methods, which are shaped by implicit or explicit religious orientations. Pastoral counselors can be described as bilingual and bicultural. Their graduate education teaches them the languages of both psychological and religious studies. They learn methods for bridging these disciplines more often by example than explicit discussions about methodology. As this chapter illustrates, the near history of American pastoral counseling in the 20th century generated several distinct ways of relating psychological studies with religious and theological studies. I trace this history and outline two dominant methods and one emergent method of relating psychological and religious studies to the practice of counseling. Is there something unique about the kind of help that people get from pastoral counselors who bridge psychological studies and religious and theological studies? How is such counseling shaped by the private faith compartments of lay pastoral counselors and the public vocations of religiously endorsed counselors? This chapter explores these questions by looking at the ways that pastoral counselors draw on both psychological and religious/theological knowledge in the counseling they do. A brief look at history highlights why questions about interdisciplinary method became important in the second half of the 20th century. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

With this thesis as a starting point, the implications of globalization for human development are discussed: the impact of the Internet on the embodied self, globalization and localization as two sides of the same coin, and the emergence of global and local identities, including their bicultural and hybrid manifestations. Furthermore, attention is given to the balance between homophily, as a necessary condition for effective communication between different cultural positions, and heterophily, as a source for innovation and creativity at cultural interfaces. In this context, psychology as a discipline is criticized for its universal pretensions. Finally, arguments are presented for studying the influence of globalization on lifelong development, including the process of aging, and for the necessity of dialogical models for the study of self and identity in a globalizing world.

Abstract = {This chapter begins with a description of extreme within-group and between-group differences among Hispanics. This diversity affects psychological test usage and mandates early evaluation of client language skills, acculturation status, countries of origin, and immigration details. An examination of psychometrics applied to standardized tests precedes description and discussion of adaptations of these tests. Adaptations of standardized tests include translations and adaptations, as well as comparisons between original and translated versions. Some adaptations may include approaches to assess Hispanic ethnic identity and/or one’s cultural self, as opposed to a translated Western self. The Tell-Me-A-Story (TEMAS; Costantino & Malgady, 1999), an underutilized, nonstandardized test, has acceptable psychometrics and provides an instrument comparable to standardized tests with adaptations. Of equivalent and comparable importance to test adaptation is adaptation of intake procedures. For example, attention to cultural issues identified by cultural formulations and culture-bound disorders can reduce cultural issues related to diagnosis and psychiatric treatment. Many community mental health centers use the multicultural assessment–intervention process (MAIP) model, described later in this chapter. Acculturation status categorization can be integrated in these settings to provide competent and ethical multicultural services. As a result, acculturated, bicultural, marginal, and traditional Hispanics receive different assessment services and psychological tests. Fundamental alterations in education and training are necessary to provide enduring changes in how psychological tests are used in a multicultural society. These changes include a cultural competency model associated with practice guidelines and fairness in representing ethnic minority students and faculty. Adequate mentoring and academic supports are required for all program students, and cultural contexts should permeate all program components and activities. Scientific competency and cultural competency are equally important and essential for practice and multicultural societies. Personal and professional language fluency assessment and training are now an ethical imperative for services to Spanish-dominant and bilingual clients.

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of including acculturation concepts in behavioral and social science research that focuses on immigrants and minorities, the conceptualization of acculturation has varied substantially across studies. The present study was conducted to assess the feasibility of Schwartz et al.’s model (Schwartz, Unger, Zamboanga, & Szapocznik, 2010) by applying the consensual qualitative research approach (Hill et al., 2005) with existing data obtained in a qualitative study with 22 Japanese and Japanese American women in Seattle, Washington. Overall, the model provided a useful framework in assessing acculturation among Japanese and Japanese Americans even though some adjustment appeared to be necessary. There was noticeable variability across three domains (i.e., Practice, Value, and Identity) with both foreign-born Issei (1st generation) and the U.S-born Nisei/Sansei (2nd and 3rd generation) groups. On the Practice domain, both the foreign-born and the U.S.-born groups showed a tendency toward bicultural orientation whereas two groups presented a distinct pattern on both the Value and Identification domains. The process of acculturation and enculturation on these domains were illustrated with specific examples. The importance of incorporating recent cultural changes of Japanese Americans is discussed. The dynamic interactions among individuals, family, and the environment are also highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: This research examines the impact of biculturalism on the decision making, identity perceptions, and consumption patterns of children of parents from different countries of origin and different cultural and ethnic backgrounds (i.e., biculturals from birth). Methodology: This research uses semi-structured depth interviews with the adult children of binational households. We use our Cross Ball and Jar (CBJ) projective technique, which utilizes a tactile, hands-on sorting and ranking process to facilitate discussion of the multifaceted identities and cultural affiliations of bicultural consumers. Findings: Our findings reveal that these "true" biculturals, growing up within a bicultural and binational home, have a more fluid, less clear-cut perception of their identity. Four emergent themes are examined: "Openness," "Splitness," "Outside the Mainstream," and "Badge of Honor." Research implications: Based on these findings, the complexity of identity perceptions is revealed. Participants' discussion of their struggles to fit in adds to our efforts to better understand multiculturalistn's impact, an understanding facilitated by the use of our CBJ projective technique. Originality/value of chapter: This study raises awareness about the consumption behavior of multicultural consumers and their ongoing interaction with mainstream society. Second, our research extends the current literature on multiculturalism and biculturalism, by focusing on this particular type of bicultural consumer. Finally, this research tests the innovative CBJ projective technique, as a simple and flexible interactive tool to assist researchers in exploring complex, multifaceted identities.

Abstract = {To explore the possible cognitive consequences of biculturalism, the authors examine the complexity of cultural representations in monocultural and bicultural individuals. Study 1 found that Chinese American biculturals' free descriptions of both American and Chinese cultures are higher in cognitive complexity than that of Anglo-American monoculturals, but the same effect was not apparent in descriptions of culturally neutral entities (landscapes). With the same procedures, Study 2 found that the cultural representations of biculturals with low levels of Bicultural Identity Integration (BII; or biculturals with conflicted cultural identities) are more cognitively complex than that of biculturals with high BII (biculturals with compatible cultural identities). This article shows that cultural frame switching and BII have meaningful cognitive consequences; furthermore, it suggests that exposure to more than one culture may increase individuals' ability to detect, process, and organize everyday cultural meaning, highlighting the potential benefits of multiculturalism.

Abstract = {Background/Context: Many scholars in the fields of teacher education, multicultural education, and bilingual education have argued that children of recent immigrants are best served in classrooms that have teachers who understand the cultural background and the home language of their students. Culturally knowledgeable and responsive teachers are important in early education and care settings that serve children from immigrant families. However, there is little research on immigrant teachers’ cultural and professional knowledge or on their political access to curricular/pedagogical decision-making. Focus of Study: This study is part of the larger Children Crossing Borders (CCB) study: a comparative study of what practitioners and parents who are recent immigrants in multiple countries think should happen in early education settings. Here, we present an analysis of the teacher interviews that our team conducted in the United States and compare the perspectives of immigrant teachers with those of their nonimmigrant counterparts, specifically centering on the cultural expertise of immigrant teachers who work within their own immigrant community. Research Design: The research method used in the CCB project is a variation of the multivocal ethnographic research method used in the two Preschool in Three Cultures studies. We made videotapes of typical days in classrooms for 4-year-olds in early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings in five countries (England, France, Germany, Italy, and the United States) and then used these videos as cues for focus group interviews with parents and teachers. Using a coding framework designed by the national CCB team, we coded 30 focus group interviews. The coding framework was designed to facilitate comparisons across countries, cities, and categories of participants (teachers and parents, immigrant and nonimmigrant). Findings/Results: Teachers who are themselves immigrants from the same communities of the children and families they serve seem perfectly positioned to bridge the cultural and linguistic worlds of home and school. However, our study of teachers in five U.S. cities at a number of early childhood settings suggests that teachers who are themselves immigrants often experience a dilemma that prevents them from applying their full expertise to the education and care of children of recent immigrants. Rather than feeling empowered by their bicultural, bilingual knowledge and their connection to multiple communities, many immigrant teachers instead report that they often feel stuck between their pedagogical training and their cultural knowledge. Conclusions/Recommendations: Bicultural, bilingual staff, and especially staff members who are themselves immigrants from the community served by the school, can play an invaluable role in parent–staff dialogues, but only if their knowledge is valued, enacted, and encouraged as an extension of their professional role as early childhood educators. For the teachers, classrooms, and structures in our study, this would require nonimmigrant practitioners to have a willingness to consider other cultural versions of early childhood pedagogy as having merit and to enter into dialogue with immigrant teachers and immigrant communities.

The seven theoretical and empirical papers collectively address issues surrounding acculturation, cultural home and belonging, identity development and conflict, intercultural personhood, and psychological well-being. This special issue raises and addresses key questions on the conventional notion of a stable and secure cultural identity, challenges the common conception of bilingualism and biculturalism, analyses the processes through which different types of bicultural identities are formed, and suggests directions for future research on the critical issue of searching for a "cultural home" in a multicultural society.

Abstract = {Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is integral to the successful treatment of HIV infection. Research has indicated that HIV-infected Latinos may have difficulty adhering to ART. While studies have demonstrated strong relationships between numerous psychosocial factors and ART adherence, no research has examined if cultural factors are also involved in ART adherence among Latinos. Our study examined the relationship between acculturation to mainstream U.S. culture, bicultural self-efficacy, and ART adherence among HIV-infected Puerto Rican adults living in the United States. Participants with ≥95% adherence scored higher on U.S.- and Latino-involvement acculturation scales and on a measure of bicultural self-efficacy compared to those with suboptimal adherence. Among bicultural HIV-infected Puerto Ricans, both acculturation and self-efficacy to navigate between cultures were positively related to adherence. Understanding the role of an individual’s sociocultural experience may help elucidate why HIV-infected Latinos have difficulties achieving optimal ART adherence and improve ART adherence interventions.

Abstract = {Many of the principles and practices that have influenced outdoor education in Aotearoa New Zealand find their genesis in the United Kingdom and North America. In recent times, many of these foundational assumptions have been called into question. This paper highlights how emerging ‘local’ voices are questioning and reframing how outdoor education is conceptualised and practiced. In large part this is due to a sense of distinctiveness borne from the bicultural foundations that underpin governance and policy-making. This paper explores how outdoor educators are developing pedagogies that acknowledge the particularities of our context, particularly the bicultural foundation of Aotearoa New Zealand. The paper highlights how social and cultural influences shape educational policy and how outdoor educators are responding, both theoretically and practically, to meet the needs of learners in an increasingly diverse society.

Abstract = {The current research investigated how patterns of home and host cultural identification can explain which individuals who have lived abroad achieve the greatest creative and professional success. We hypothesized that individuals who identified with both their home and host cultures (i.e., biculturals) would show enhanced creativity and professional success compared with individuals who identified with only a single culture (i.e., assimilated and separated individuals). Further, we expected that these effects would be driven by biculturals' greater levels of integrative complexity, an information processing capacity that involves considering and combining multiple perspectives. Two studies demonstrated that biculturals exhibited more fluency, flexibility, and novelty on a creative uses task (Study 1) and produced more innovations at work (Study 2) than did assimilated or separated individuals. Study 3 extended these findings to general professional outcomes: Bicultural professionals achieved higher promotion rates and more positive reputations compared with assimilated or separated individuals. Importantly, in all 3 studies, integrative complexity mediated the relationship between home/host identification and performance. Overall, the current results demonstrate who is most likely to achieve professional and creative success following experiences abroad and why.

Abstract = {Writing is a culturally situated activity. When writing is outsourced to other cultures, because of a lack of knowledge of the users' culture and the influence of the local culture, those doing the writing and design, despite various strategies adopted for overcoming these disadvantages, may not know how to culturally situate the writing. It is therefore important that bicultural people who know the users' culture as well as the culture of those doing the outsourced work give writing teams feedback about the users' culture. While cultural differences depend on various categories like ethnicity, nationality, and profession, this chapter focuses on the cultural miscommunication caused by nationality, partly because in outsourcing, nationality is an important category, which causes cultural miscommunication and partly because it would take too much space to deal with the cultural differences caused by other categories. My chapter therefore examines writing situations in places like India to where writing is outsourced. I argue that although those doing the writing attempt to eliminate the effects of local influences in their writing, the problem of lack of cultural situatedness is not fully addressed. As a solution, I suggest that bicultural people, who know both the users' culture and the culture of those doing the outsourced work, act as a resource to help those doing the outsourced writing to understand the users' culture. Finally, I give examples of culturally situated documentation and point out how such documentation greatly helps users. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {In this chapter, we explore cross-cultural differences in brand extension response in more detail. Specifically, we further examine the idea that brand extension response differs between cultures due to differences in the way that brand extension fit is judged. We base our research on cross-cultural psychology describing cultural differences in styles of thinking, with East Asian societies characterized by holistic thinking and Western societies characterized by analytic thinking. Holistic thinking involves an orientation to the context or field as a whole, whereas analytic thinking involves a detachment of the object from its context and a focus on attributes of the object. Our general prediction, in line with Monga and John (2007), is that styles of thinking influence the way in which consumers from Eastern versus Western cultures judge brand extension fit and arrive at brand extension evaluations. We provide further support for styles of thinking as a major contributor to cultural differences in brand extension response in three studies. In study 1, we replicate Monga and John (2007), finding that Eastern consumers are more positive in their judgments of brand extension fit and evaluation than are Westerners. We find this pattern across multiple brand extensions that are very distant to moderately distant from their parent brands (Coke and Kodak). In addition, we provide evidence for styles of thinking as the mechanism for these differences, finding that the types of extension thoughts generated by Easterners (holistic) and Westerners (analytic) mediate the influence of culture on brand extension response. In the next two studies, we adopt novel approaches for examining brand extension evaluations across cultures. In study 2, we provide new evidence using a hypothetical parent brand (Excera), finding that Easterners (Westerners) provide more (less) positive evaluations of brand extensions distant from the parent brand. By using a hypothetical parent brand, we rule out alternative explanations for study 1 findings based on possible cross-cultural differences in parent brand knowledge/beliefs. In study 3, we take a different approach to studying the role of analytic and holistic thinking in cultural differences by comparing brand extension responses for Easterners, Westerners, and bicultural consumers. We find, as expected, that bicultural consumers fall midway between the two extremes, with brand extension responses that are more positive than those of Westerners but less positive than those of Easterners.

Abstract = {With the increasing Latino population in the United States, it is critical to examine the influence of the process of acculturation on health care practices and utilization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between acculturation level and post-partum visit (PPV) compliance among Latinas participating in a larger psycho-educational intervention aimed at encouraging women to engage in positive healthcare practices. Acculturation was measured with the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire which assigned participants to five categories: Assimilated, Separated, Moderate, Bicultural and Alienation. Logistic Regression analyses were conducted to predict post-partum visit attendance. Odds ratios and relative risk of not attending the post-partum visit are presented. Results suggest women in the Separation and Assimilation groups were less likely than bicultural group members to attend the PPV. The only other variable that was significant in this analysis is the group condition, indicating that the intervention group was more likely to attend the PPV than the control group. Women identifying as bicultural seem to participate more actively in their own healthcare as they draw on the cultural assets that have a positive influence on informal health practices, such as healthy eating and refraining from drug use. Bicultural group members can also use formal skills related to language and knowledge of the dominant culture to help effectively navigate the healthcare system. Implications for research, intervention and practice are discussed to improve healthcare practices and increase utilization among Latinas.

Abstract = {This research examined whether peer relationships amongst ethnic minority status children reflect the social groups to which children belong and the degree to which they identify with these groups. A longitudinal study was conducted to investigate the influence of group identities (i.e., ethnic and national) on children's perceived peer acceptance and preference for same‐ethnic friendships. Measures of ethnic and English identification, perceived peer acceptance, and friendship choice were administered to 207 south‐Asian English children, aged between 5 and 11, at two time points 6 months apart. In line with predictions, longitudinal analysis showed that bicultural identification (i.e., higher ethnic and English identity) was related to higher perceived peer acceptance and less preference for same‐ethnic friendships. Importantly, as hypothesized, this finding was limited to the older children with more advanced social‐cognitive abilities. The results suggest that older children who adopted a bicultural identity were able to strategically ‘flag’ their multiple group identities, within their multicultural peer groups, to obtain acceptance amongst the maximum number of peers and show less preference for same‐ethnic friendships. This study extends previous peer relations research, which has typically focused on individual social deficits or classroom norms, by showing that group identities influence peer relationships amongst ethnic minority status children.

Abstract = {North American research has consistently reported higher social anxiety among people of Asian heritage compared to people of Western heritage. The present study used a cross-national sample of 692 university students to explore explanatory hypotheses using planned contrasts of group differences in social anxiety and related variables. The East Asian socialization hypothesis proposed social anxiety would show a linear relation corresponding to the degree of exposure to East Asian cultural norms. This hypothesis was not supported. The cultural discrepancy hypothesis examined whether bicultural East Asian participants (residing in Canada) would endorse higher social anxiety in comparison to unicultural participants (Western-heritage Canadians and native Koreans and Chinese). Compared to unicultural participants, bicultural East Asian participants reported higher social anxiety and depression, a relation that was partially mediated by bicultural participants' reports of lower self-efficacy about initiating social relationships and lower perceived social status. Overall, the results suggest higher reports of social anxiety among bicultural East Asians may be conceptualized within the context of cultural discrepancy with the mainstream culture.

This study specifically evaluated the effect of genetic counseling and Connexin-26 and Connexin-30 genetic test results on participants’ deaf identity and understanding of their genetic test results. Connexin-26 and Connexin-30 genetic testing was offered to participants in the context of linguistically and culturally appropriate genetic counseling. Questionnaire data collected from 209 deaf adults at four time points (baseline, immediately following pre-test genetic counseling, 1-month following genetic test result disclosure, and 6-months after result disclosure) were analyzed. Four deaf identity orientations (hearing, marginal, immersion, bicultural) were evaluated using subscales of the Deaf Identity Development Scale-Revised. We found evidence that participants understood their specific genetic test results following genetic counseling, but found no evidence of change in deaf identity based on genetic counseling or their genetic test results. This study demonstrated that culturally and linguistically appropriate genetic counseling can improve deaf clients’ understanding of genetic test results, and the formation of deaf identity was not directly related to genetic counseling or Connexin-26 and Connexin-30 genetic test results.

Abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression are common mental health disorders in the refugee population. High rates of violence, trauma, and PTSD among refugee women remain unaddressed. The process of implementing a mental health screening tool among multiethnic, newly arrived refugee women receiving routine obstetric and gynecologic care in a dedicated refugee women’s health clinic is described. The Refugee Health Screener-15 (RHS-15) is a culturally responsive, efficient, validated screening instrument that detects symptoms of emotional distress across diverse refugee populations and languages. An interdisciplinary community partnership was established with a local behavioral health services agency to facilitate the referral of women scoring positive on the RHS-15. Staff and provider training sessions, as well as the incorporation of bicultural, multilingual cultural health navigators, greatly facilitated linguistically appropriate care coordination for refugee women in a culturally sensitive manner. Twenty-six (23.2%) of the 112 women who completed the RHS-15 scored positive, of which 14 (53.8%) were Iraqi, 1 (3.8%) was Burmese, and 3 (11.5%) were Somali. Among these 26 women, 8 (30.8%) are actively receiving mental health services and 5 (19.2%) have appointments scheduled. However, 13 (50%) are not enrolled in mental health care because of either declining services (46.2%) or a lack of insurance (53.8%). Screening for mental disorders among refugee women will promote greater awareness and identify those individuals who would benefit from further mental health evaluation and treatment. Sustainable interdisciplinary models of care are necessary to promote health education, dispel myths, and reduce the stigma of mental health.

Method: The Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE) is a population-based epidemiological study of Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area. Internal consistency reliability was assessed by determining the coefficient alpha and inter-item correlation coefficients. Content validity was assessed by bilingual and bicultural study researchers and community leaders. Results: The reliability and validity analysis supported the use of the Chinese version of the psychological and social well-being indicators in the PINE study. The value of Cronbach’s alpha for fives scales ranged from .64 to .82, indicating reasonable internal consistency. Content validity was established through intensive review by a panel of experts. Discussion: The instruments discussed in this report are reliable and valid measures to assess key dimensions of psychological and social distress of Chinese older adults.

Abstract = {Chinese American women with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are more vulnerable to poor diabetes outcomes than men because immigrant status, ethnicity, and economics intersect with gender to diminish disease management opportunities. We explored gender differences in factors associated with diabetes management at intake and after treatment with a behavioral intervention in first-generation Chinese American immigrants. A sample of 178 Chinese Americans with T2DM was enrolled in a single-cohort, repeated-measures delayed-treatment trial. Data were collected at baseline, 8, 16, 24, and 32 weeks with 6-week treatment provided after 16 weeks. Gender differences at baseline and gender by treatment interactions were noted. Women at baseline reported significantly worse depressive symptoms and general health.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2015-18606-014[/rid]). Background: Conducting research with underserved communities with little exposure to research presents a number of challenges and opportunities. Our study used a community-based approach to better understand factors that influence breast and cervical cancer screening among Hmong women. Objective: This article shares lessons learned during the process of developing and conducting qualitative research with a Hmong community with limited experience with research. Method: We conducted 17 key informant and 84 in-depth interviews with Hmong women and men. Research team discussions, insights from Hmong research team members, input from our Community Advisory Committee, and project documents were sources of information about the process of conducting research in this community. Results: Lessons learned concern including a cultural insider as an investigator; building community partnerships and support; establishing and working with a community advisory committee; hiring and training bilingual, bicultural staff; and using culturally appropriate materials and methods in a small, kinship-based community. We used multiple strategies to ensure that this study was conducted in a culturally appropriate manner. Conclusion: The lessons learned from our experiences can provide guidance to researchers on methodological and practical issues in conducting research with the Hmong and can inform future research with the Hmong and other similar underserved populations.

Abstract = {Heavy alcohol use in college students is a serious health risk. It is unclear how cultural variables impact alcohol use in Hispanic college populations. Here, the relationships between gender, bicultural identity, familism, and adherence to traditional gender roles with heavy episodic drinking (HED) in a Hispanic college sample are assessed. Participants, 80 males and 80 females, were asked to complete a questionnaire packet, which assessed demographic information, as well as measures designed to rate drinking amount and frequency, bicultural integration, familism, and traditional gender role adherence. Average age of the sample was 19.9 years (SD = 3.05), in which the majority of participants were classified as either Freshmen or Sophomores (88.8%). Overall, 47.5% of participants reported engaging in HED, with 51% of men and 44% of women reporting HED. Univariate analyses along with logistic regression were utilized to assess possible differences and correlates of HED. Neither individual predictors nor the overall model were statistically significant. These findings suggest the need for continued assessment of HED in Hispanic college students using other culturally based constructs, as well as psychosocial factors that are found to predict heavy drinking in other ethnocultural college-aged students.

Abstract = {This research provides experimental evidence for cultural influence on one of the most basic elements of emotional processing: attention to positive versus negative stimuli. To this end, we focused on Russian culture, which is characterized by brooding and melancholy. In Study 1, Russians spent significantly more time looking at negative than positive pictures, whereas Americans did not show this tendency. In Study 2, Russian Latvians were randomly primed with symbols of each culture, after which we measured the speed of recognition for positive versus negative trait words. Biculturals were significantly faster in recognizing negative words (as compared with baseline) when primed with Russian versus Latvian cultural symbols. Greater identification with Russian culture facilitated this effect. We provide a theoretical discussion of mental processes underlying cultural differences in emotion research.

Using purposeful and snowball sampling, adult participants responded to open-ended questions about their understanding of being Latino. Analysis indicated that changes in the environment or life circumstances had the greatest effect on the reevaluation of identity. This process, referred to as looping, occurred in 35% of the adults surveyed and illustrates the process that occurs when an individual questions previous understanding of identity yet does not lose his/her previous sense of committed self. In addition, the study found that adults who self-identify as having a bicultural orientation were more likely to experience a looping effect, though some Latino-oriented individuals also experienced this effect.

Abstract = {If all immigrants and sojourners could smoothly navigate between multiple cultures, this would be an ideal world. The ambivalent feeling associated with being bicultural may stem from the fact that cultures come in a “package”—they are not only defined by shared beliefs, norms, and practices but are also demarcated by race, ethnicity, and social class. In most societies, unfortunately, there are still wide power differentials among racial and ethnic groups (Lott, in press); immigrants and their descendants, especially visible ethnic minorities, are often bestowed with less power than their ethnic majority host in the society (see Deaux, 2006). These power differentials may manifest in a tendency for the majority group to dominate over ethnic minority groups. To justify and legitimize their domination, the majority group could hold negative stereotypes against the ethnic minority groups, as well as display prejudice and discrimination toward them (social dominance theory; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Facing such unfavorable treatment, ethnic minority group members understandably feel unjustly treated, angry, and resentful, thereby making it hard for them to identify with the mainstream culture (Verkuyten & Yildiz, 2007). Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that these individuals would incorporate the mainstream culture as a part of their self-definition. Importantly, when it involves the exposure to cultures of other racial or ethnic groups, the interplay of these two processes is moderated by individuals’ lay theories (beliefs) about the nature of race. Specifically, we postulate two types of lay theories, each setting up a different framework within which its beholders view the racial–ethnic world and result in a harmonious versus discordant interplay between multicultural mind and multicultural self. Because this model was built from my research on East Asian Americans (mainly Chinese Americans and Korean Americans), I focus the discussion that follows based on evidence from this particular group of bicultural individuals.

Two studies on Hong Kong undergraduates with different activation procedures (exposure to cultural icons in Study 1 and questionnaire language in Study 2) and different SWB measures (life satisfaction in Study 1 and subjective happiness in Study 2) provided convergent support to this hypothesis. The present research contributes to the existing understanding of culture and SWB by (a) examining the processes underlying the SWB judgment of bicultural individuals, (b) highlighting cross-situational variations of cultural influence on SWB judgment, and (c) allowing for testing causality of such influence.

Abstract = {Both nationally and within the State of California, it is unlikely that those children most susceptible to lead exposure are adequately screened for blood lead levels. New and creative approaches are necessary to reach these individuals. In-home phlebotomy was employed to test blood lead levels of 128 San Diego households containing Latino children aged 12-71 months. As part of a lead exposure study, these households were randomly selected from 12 census tracts in the downtown area during February-July, 2006. By employing a bicultural/bilingual phlebotomist, the participation rate for in-home phlebotomy was 89% among enrolled study participants. This rate is substantially higher than estimates for customary testing of similar underserved groups through physicians, has the advantage of reaching individuals without medical insurance, and contrasts favorably ($45 per individual test) with typical office visit costs. Culturally appropriate in-home phlebotomy may be a useful method for medical screening to meet the needs of underserved communities. Editors' Strategic Implications: The authors provide an excellent example of the importance of bringing prevention services to clients, literally in terms of the home visitation format but also with respect to the comfort level that may come from interacting with a bicultural and bilingual professional.

Abstract = {Most acculturation research has been conducted in immigrant settings. The present study examined the generalizability of acculturation models and the adaptiveness of acculturation strategies in another bicultural environment--a colonial setting. The sample included 138 girls (M = 13.8 years) and their parents from Hong Kong, a former British colony. Results verified that both Chinese and western acculturation occurred on individual psychological levels and that the bidimensional model was a suitable acculturation framework. Using hierarchical multiple regression, results suggested that acculturation towards Chinese (majority) culture was related to better adaptation in terms of higher academic achievement and positive family dynamics (parental nurturance and closer family relationships). Acculturation towards western (minority) culture was related to poorer adaptation in terms of engaging in greater misconduct and negative family interactions (larger intergenerational value discrepancies and family conflicts). Thus, acculturation towards the majority culture held adaptive implications, whereas acculturation towards the minority culture held maladaptive implications. Consideration of the bicultural composition (e.g., status, prestige, strength of cultural networks of each culture) should be incorporated into acculturation theory to better understand adjustment implications across a wide range of contexts.

Generation 1.5 students, who are bilingual and bicultural but maintain their heritage language, have been studied extensively in postsecondary settings, with little attention to their academic trajectories in secondary school. In this chapter, two strategies using mediation are discussed that proved instrumental in promoting access and engagement with academic writing. First, students' funds of knowledge pertaining to literary practices were identified and examined to highlight students' competencies as leverage for mediation to academic writing. Second, developing a topic for persuasive writing from students' narratives about their cultural backgrounds was mediated through whole-group and individual questioning from general to specific. The teacher's role emerged as actively valuing students' funds of knowledge and understanding their cultural backgrounds for leveraging to meet expectations of academic writing.

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined common barriers and best practices in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of Latino lay health promoter programs. Methods: Ten lay health promoter program coordinators serving Maryland Latinos were recruited in 2009 through snowball sampling for in-depth semistructured interviews with a bilingual and bicultural researcher. Program coordinators were asked about recruitment, selection, training, and supervision; key program elements; and evaluation. Analyses were conducted to identify common themes. Results: Respondents had worked up to 13 years in programs focused on such areas as awareness of healthy lifestyles and reducing risk of illness. Coordinators looked for Latino leaders with team-building skills and a desire to help the community. Six programs compensated promoters with stipends; 4 paid an hourly wage. Promoters were usually trained in monthly meetings that actively engaged them. Most programs conducted site visits, practice sessions, and performance evaluations. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that successful health promoter programs require needs assessments, formation of a target population advisory board, identification of appropriate promoters, and a significant amount of training. These findings can be used to guide future programs in the identification, recruitment, and training of health promoters as well as in program monitoring.

Abstract = {Bicultural individuals vary in the degree to which their two cultural identities are integrated—Bicultural Identity Integration (BII). Among Asian-Americans, for example, some experience their Asian and American sides as integrated (high BII) whereas others experience the two as divided (low BII). Past research on social judgement found that individual differences in BII affect the way biculturals respond to cultural cues or norms in their situation. Asian-Americans with low BII tend to contrast to the cultural norm (e.g. they exhibit typically American judgements when in Asian cultural situations) rather than assimilate to them, a response observed more among high BII individuals (e.g., they exhibit typically Asian judgements when in Asian cultural situations). Research has interpreted the contrastive response as reflecting implicit identity motives, yet past studies used measures that make cultural differences salient. Conscious awareness of the experimental hypothesis could elicit contrastive responses. The present research assessed forecasts of others’ behaviour in which cultural group differences are less obvious: Asians, compared to Westerners, forecast more positive behaviours from others. In three experiments with Asian-Americans, we found the contrastive response by low BII individuals persisted. They made more positive forecasts after exposure to American versus Asian cultural cues. This suggests that the moderating role of BII on responses to cultural cues is not a matter of demand characteristics or limited to stereotypical cultural differences. Implications for bicultural identity, implicit processes, and organizational behaviour are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to refine and expand a culturally tailored individual-level diabetes self-management intervention to a family-level intervention. Methods: Using community-based participatory research principles, Mexican American adults (n = 12) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and family members (n = 12) in the United States–Mexico border region participated in 6 focus group interviews, conducted by bilingual, bicultural facilitators. Facilitators and barriers to T2DM management were identified. Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Through an iterative analysis process, 5 categories represented participants with T2DM: (1) strategies my family can use to support our managing T2DM, (2) be sensitive to my challenges, (3) stop telling me what to eat or do, (4) how can we peacefully coexist, and (5) I feel supported. Categories identified by family members were (1) changing behaviors together, (2) sharing not controlling, (3) supporting positive behaviors, and (4) your behaviors frustrate me. Conclusions: The family was reinforced as a major influence for successful T2DM management. Family support requires that families value and develop knowledge and skills for T2DM management. This family intervention builds on family assets and relationships, shifting from traditional externally motivated individual models to create a shared commitment to manage T2DM among Mexican American adults.

Abstract = {This ethnographic study explores the identity development of 9 deaf participants through the narratives of their educational experiences in either mainstream or special schools for the Deaf. This exploration goes beyond a binary conceptualization of deaf identity that allows for only the medical and social models and proposes a bicultural ‘‘dialogue model.’’ This postmodern theoretical framework is used to examine the diversity of identities of deaf learners. The inclusion of the researcher’s own fluid cross-cultural identity as a bicultural ‘‘DeaF’’ participant in this study provides an auto-ethnographic gateway into exploring the lives of other deaf, Deaf, or bicultural DeaF persons. The findings suggest that deaf identity is not a static concept but a complex ongoing quest for belonging, a quest that is bound up with the acceptance of being deaf while ‘‘finding one’s voice’’ in a hearing-dominant society. Through the use of dialogue and narrative tools, the study challenges educators, parents, and researchers to broaden their understanding of how deaf identity, and the dignity associated with being a deaf person is constructed.

Abstract = {This study applies advanced conceptualization and measurement to an analysis of acculturation among 1632 Mexican-heritage preadolescents. We assessed whether—and how—multiple measures combine to form a latent acculturation construct that groups individuals into classes; and determine how many and what classes (or types) of acculturation are experienced by this sample of 5th graders. Measures included attitudinal, behavioral, and linguistic acculturation, generation status, time in the US, ethnic identification, and contact with the culture of origin. The analysis identified five classes of acculturation, differing in size and characterized by specific measures of acculturation: less acculturated, moderately bicultural, strongly bicultural, highly acculturated, and marginalized. Although most youths fell into the first four classes, consonant with their exposure to American society, a small minority of youths fell into the last class. Despite substantial exposure to US culture and recent exposure to Mexican culture, these youth showed little affinity for either culture. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This article describes and analyzes patterns of first sexual intercourse and contraception use from a bicultural perspective. Study results are based on a 2009–2010 large-scale national probability survey of young adults aged 18 to 24 years in Croatia (n = 1,005) and Norway (n = 871). The findings corroborated the persistence of the dual model of sexual initiation in Europe (Scandinavian vs. Mediterranean), in which Norwegian women and Croatian men reported coital debut at an earlier age than their gender counterparts. Age difference between partners and the prevalence of condom use at first coitus were similar in both countries, with differences in contraceptive choices emerging with time. Young Norwegian men and women switched from using condoms to hormonal contraception when having been coitally active for some time. Interestingly, “the pill” remains rather unpopular among young Croatian women. Controlling for selected variables, using a condom at most recent sexual intercourse was significantly associated with condom use at first intercourse in all groups except Norwegian men, as well as with years of coital activity (except among Croatian men). Additionally, the odds of a condom being used at most recent intercourse were significantly correlated with same-sex sexual experience (only among Norwegian men) and with reporting the most recent intercourse with a casual partner (only among Norwegian participants). Country-specific patterns of contraceptive use are discussed in the context of public health and prevention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This article describes the difficulties a mainstream family therapy service experienced in working with families from a refugee background. The experience of six therapists and five bicultural workers, who are also the referring agents, was captured in focus groups, and the reflections that emerged shaped a four-part approach for working with families from a refugee background. Live consultation, either by the family therapist or bicultural worker, is suggested as a way to marry the expertise of family therapists who are not cultural ‘insiders’ with the ‘lived experience’ and cultural expertise of bicultural support workers. The process of reflecting on therapeutic failure resulted in several principles for working therapeutically with families with a history of refugee trauma, unmet resettlement needs and family relationship challenges. These include maintaining a flexible approach to therapy, ascertaining a clear understanding of the referral context, defining an explicit therapeutic contract from the first session, being mindful of the important role that language plays and terminating therapy if it is contra-indicated.

Abstract = {Prior studies comparing US-born and foreign-born Asian Americans have shown that birth in the US conveys greater risk of obesity. Our study investigates whether retention of Asian culture might be protective for obesity despite acculturation to US lifestyle. We classified self-identified Asian American respondents of the California Health Interview Survey as traditional, bicultural, and acculturated using nativity and language proficiency in English and Asian language. We then examined the association of acculturation with overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) in a multivariate regression model. Acculturated respondents had higher adjusted odds of being overweight/ obese than bicultural respondents (2.13 [1.40–3.23] for men, 3.28 [2.14–5.04] for women), but bicultural respondents had similar odds of being overweight/obese as traditional respondents (.98 [.69–1.41] for men, .72 [.50–1.05] for women). Among the bicultural, second and first generation respondents were equally likely to be overweight/obese. Biculturalism in Asian Americans as measured by Asian language retention appears protective against obesity. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying this association.

Abstract = {Cross-national research on social description documents that Westerners favor abstract linguistic categories (e.g. adjectives rather than verbs) more than East Asians. Whereas culture-related schemas are assumed to underlie these differences, no research has examined this directly. The present study used the cultural priming paradigm to distinguish the role of cultural schemas from alternative country-related explanations involving linguistic structures or educational experiences. It compared Asian-Americans' descriptions of others and memory for social information following American versus Asian priming. Asian priming fostered more concrete, contextualized verb-based descriptions and reduced memory errors associated with trait inference, compared to American priming (and to separate samples of non-primed Asian-Americans and Euro-Americans). This provides the first incisive evidence that cultural schemas influence the linguistic categories used to describe and remember social targets. Implications for research on biculturals, culture-related schemas, and linguistic practices are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Within the motivation literature, it has been indicated that athletes respond more effectively to sport’s contextual challenges through effective adaptation skills. Fiske identified five core motives as facilitators of the adaptation process across cultures: belonging, understanding, controlling, self-enhancement, and trusting. Through a cultural sport psychology approach, the adaptation challenges and strategies of Canadian Aboriginal adolescent athletes from one community (Wikwemikong) are described as they traveled off reserve to compete in mainstream sporting events. Concurrently, Fiske’s core motives are considered in relation to youth sport participants from the aforementioned Aboriginal community. Culture sensitive research methods among the Wikwemikong, including community meetings, talking circles (TCs), indigenous coding, and coauthoring, were employed in this article. Data are reflected in three themes: (a) challenges pursuing sport outside of the Aboriginal community in advance of bicultural encounters, (b) challenging bicultural encounters in Canadian mainstream sport contexts, and (c) specific responses to racism and discrimination.

Abstract = {Following immigration emerges a need for integrating multiple identities into the sell. However, researchers disagree as to which strategy favors well-being. A high well-being is associated to perceiving less conflict and distance between the two cultures according to the bicultural identity theory, and to high identification to both cultures according to the acculturation strategies theory. The cognitive-developmental model, elaborated recently, predicts that perceiving higher coherence between both cultures will be related to higher well-being. The predictive values of these theories have been assessed with bicultural individuals. Regressions and contrasts tests support more strongly the cognitive-developmental model.

The present study explores cultural identity patterns and the sociodemographic and family contexts of 150 Arab Muslim American young adults ages 18-25 who completed an Internet study. The participants fell into three cultural identity groups: High Bicultural, Moderate Bicultural, and High Arab Cultural. Although all three groups demonstrated positive general family functioning, the Moderate Bicultural group was distinct in that they were less likely to be engaged or married, and they experienced less family support and more family acculturative stressors. The results highlight the importance of the family context in contributing to a stronger sense of cultural identity for young adults who fall at the intersection of Arab and American culture and Muslim faith.

A total of 115 deaf and hard of hearing (D/HH) adolescents completed a demographic questionnaire, the Deaf Identity Developmental Scale (DIDS) and an attitudes toward CI questionnaire. The DIDS results showed that participants' bicultural identity was strongest and marginal identity was weakest. In general, participants expressed positive attitudes toward CI. Stronger Deaf identity was associated with less positive attitudes regarding expected CI effects while stronger bicultural identity was associated with more positive attitudes. Also, bicultural identity did not contradict the acceptance of CI technology. It was concluded that exposure of D/HH youngsters to both Deaf culture and the advantages of CI seems desirable.

The study is a secondary analysis of data collected in a larger study; 393 older Norwegians and 202 older Canadians were included. The Norwegian and Canadian group self-enhanced their perceptions of psychosocial loss based on harmonious social relationships and being part of a larger social group. For self-perceptions of physical change, both groups self-enhanced on being self-sufficient and being part of a larger social group. Our findings suggest that Norwegians and Canadians are not highly individualistic people and also provide evidence of a bicultural self-perception of aging.

Abstract = {Purpose: Generally, due to limited availability of official statistics on the topic, little is known about suicide mortality in second-generation migrants. A recent study from Sweden showed that these people could be at a high suicide risk. In a generalised phenomenon, this aspect would represent an important issue in suicide prevention. This paper aims to report the profile of second-generation migrants who died by suicide and the suicide risk differentials of second-generation migrants with other Australians. Methods: Official suicide data from 2001 to 2008 were linked with State/Territory registries to collect information about the birthplace of the deceased’s parents to differentiate migration status (first, second or third-plus generation). The profile and suicide risk of second-generation migrants were compared with other generations by logistic and Poisson regression. Results: Suicide in second-generation migrants accounted for 811 cases (14.6 %). These tended to be represented by younger subjects, more often never married, as compared to the other cases. Second-generation males aged 25–39 years tended to have a higher suicide risk than first-generation migrants, but the risk was lower when compared with the third-plus generation. Second-generation migrants aged 60? tended to have a lower suicide risk than first-generation migrants. Conclusion: In Australia, second-generation migrants are not at a higher suicide risk as compared to first-generation migrants or locals (third-plus-generation). In males aged 25–39, a lower suicide risk was found in second-generations as compared to Australian-born third generation, which may be explained by their more advantageous socioeconomic status and the flexibility and resources rendered by having grown up in a bicultural environment. The higher suicide rates found amongst older first-generation migrants require further examination. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Understanding and engaging with cultural perspectives can enhance treatment for substance use issues and co-occurring mental health issues among culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. As not many services document the way they provide services to CALD clients, this research sought to investigate the ways in which alcohol and other drug counsellors at a specialist service balance cultural relevance with fidelity to a combination of psychosocial interventions. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with counsellors and clients at the Drug and Alcohol Multicultural Education Centre’s Counselling Service in a major Australian city. Interviews employed screening questions to explore the combination of brief solution focused therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and narrative therapy as well as bilingual counselling roles and information provided to clients about the service. Interviews were conducted in the four major languages spoken by clients of the service: Arabic, English, Mandarin and Vietnamese. The findings highlight 10 strategies for culturally relevant treatment. These include addressing clients’ understanding of counselling, offering bicultural and bilingual counsellors, enquiring about the importance of cultural identity to each client, responding to cues from clients about taboos or sensitive topics, and expectations about social roles and communication patterns. Furthermore, counsellors reflected upon the interpretability of psychosocial interventions in particular languages, and explained flexible and creative responses which integrate elements of cultural philosophy and communication styles into their practice of counselling.

Working in partnership with community incurs additional costs, some that can be represented in a budget summary page and others that are tied to the competing demands placed on community and academic partners. These cost considerations can inform development of community–academic partnerships. We calculated costs from a case study based on an ongoing CBPR project involving a Community Planning Group (CPG) of community co-researchers in rural Alaska and a bicultural liaison group who help bridge communication between CPG and academic co-researchers. Budget considerations specific to CBPR include travel and other communication-related costs, compensation for community partners, and food served at meetings. We also identified sources of competing demands for community and academic partners. Our findings can inform budget discussions in community-academic partnerships. Discussions of competing demands on community partners’ time can help plan timelines for CBPR projects. Our findings may also inform discussions about tenure and promotion policies that may represent barriers to participation in CBPR for academic researchers.

Abstract = {Background: Hispanics, particularly those with limited English proficiency, are underrepresented in psychiatric clinical research studies. We developed a bilingual and bicultural research clinic dedicated to the recruitment and treatment of Spanish-speaking subjects in the Predictors of Remission in Depression to Individual and Combined Treatments (PReDICT) study, a large clinical trial of treatment-naïve subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Demographic and clinical data derived from screening evaluations of the first 1,174 subjects presenting for participation were compared between the Spanish-speaking site (N = 275) and the primary English-speaking site (N = 899). Reasons for ineligibility (N = 888) for the PReDICT study were tallied for each site. Results: Compared to English speakers, Spanish speakers had a lower level of education and were more likely to be female, uninsured, and have uncontrolled medical conditions. Clinically, Spanish speakers demonstrated greater depression severity, with higher mean symptom severity scores, and a greater number of previous suicide attempts. Among the subjects who were not randomized into the PReDICT study, Spanish-speaking subjects were more likely to have an uncontrolled medical condition or refuse participation, whereas English-speaking subjects were more likely to have bipolar disorder or a non-MDD depressive disorder. Conclusion: Recruitment of Hispanic subjects with MDD is feasible and may enhance efforts at signal detection, given the higher severity of depression among Spanish-speaking participants presenting for clinical trials. Specific approaches for the recruitment and retention of Spanish-speaking participants are required. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {A representational theory of attitude change integrating research on social representations and media framing effects is proposed. The theory seeks to explain why some aspects of attitude and opinion are more malleable than others. It is posited that the framing of a given social issue may influence isolated attitudes and cognitions related to specific aspects of that issue (peripheral elements); however, framing should be less likely to influence relevant attitudes to the extent that they are anchored in societally elaborated representations, and hence form strong and coherent evaluative associations with more general concepts and values (central or core elements). As an initial test of the theory, proposed changes to a university affirmative action policy were framed using either a traditional remedial action or newly developed New Zealand-specific bicultural partnership frame. Qualitative analyses indicated that irrespective of condition, New Zealand European/Pakeha students endorsed societally elaborated "standard" discourses that positioned equality as being based solely on individual merit (i.e., grades) and opposed policies that also included ethnic group membership as a criteria used to govern resource allocations (i.e., targeted scholarships for ethnic minorities). However, participants who read the bicultural partnership frame tended to hedge such discourses by expressing limited support for the isolated and less heavily anchored issues specific to that frame. Quantitative analyses further demonstrated that although participants expressed increased support for a specific affirmative action program framed in terms of biculturalism, more generalized attitudes toward resource allocations favoring minority groups remained unchanged across conditions.

Abstract = {In this study, multicultural literature served as a site for Chinese Canadians to explore the interplay between their dual cultural backgrounds. After reading a story written by a Chinese Canadian author, participants were invited to imagine a dialogue between two characters with whom they identified, allowing the exploration of different aspects of their bicultural selves. Systematic examination of their dialogues, using cluster analysis of recurrently expressed dialogical themes, revealed four distinct expressive styles (Rhetorical Conflict, Imperative Conflict, Active Narration, and Embodied Reconciliation), each revealing a different bicultural stance. Both the rhetorically probing and explicitly imperative styles of expression reflected a fusion of Chinese and Canadian expectations regarding confrontation, although in different ways each also facilitated the maintenance of a conflictual cultural hierarchy. Active, but distanced, narrative description reflected the preservation of a collective sense of self that is characteristic of traditional Chinese culture. Finally, dialogic enactment of conflicting "voices" allowed reconciliatory, embodied, and generative fusions of Chinese and Canadian cultural expectations.

Abstract = {The multicultural movement accentuates the ability of counselors from one culture being able to efficiently work with clients of other cultures. A strong emphasis has been on counselors of the majority culture and their proficiency to cross cultural boundaries to facilitate productive sessions for ethnic minority clients. While it has been a much needed emphasis due to the majority of counselors being Caucasian, it is time to extend a shift of paradigm in expectations to ethnic minority counselors, especially those who are bicultural. Bicultural counselors possess a unique advantage when working with matching ethnic clientele: they can advocate for clients and families of their own cultural group in ways that others cannot. There exists a great responsibility which must be shouldered by ethnic minority counselors to act as cultural brokers between the majority culture and their own minority culture. However, there is no emphasis on this responsibility nor a systematic pedagogy that addresses teaching ethnic minority counselors ways in which they can use their unique position to promote mental health among people of their same culture. Consequently, counselors from ethnic backgrounds who are bicultural are not fully utilizing the resources available to them to foster mental health among their own people. As a cultural broker, the ethnic minority counselor can use the self as an instrument by (1) endorsing the utilization of counseling services, (2) modeling health, and (3) developing other bicultural counselors. These methods are ways in which the field can move beyond the textbook knowledge of multiculturalism while implementing practical measures to reach often unreachable populations.

Abstract = {We examined how cultural values of harmony and uniqueness are represented and maintained through physical media (i.e., colorings of geometric patterns) and how individuals play an active role in selecting and maintaining such cultural values. We found that colorings produced by European American adults and children were judged as more unique, whereas colorings produced by Japanese adults and children were judged as more harmonious, reflecting cultural differences in values. Harmony undergirded Japanese participants’ preferences for colorings, whereas uniqueness undergirded European American participants’ preferences for colorings. These cultural differences led participants to prefer own-culture colorings over other-culture colorings. Moreover, bicultural participants’ preferences acculturated according to their identification with their host culture. Furthermore, child rearers in Japan and Canada gave feedback about the children’s colorings that were consistent with their culture’s values. These findings suggest that simple geometric patterns can embody cultural values that are socialized and reinforced from an early age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Muslim high school students often face bicultural issues, unknown to American peers. Muslim students often deal with a "home culture" and a "school culture" and lead double lives, which can be a source of additional stress while making the transition from childhood to adulthood. This study explored the extent of acculturation issues experienced by Muslim students by using the Muslim Youth Acculturation Rating Questionnaire which is a questionnaire that was developed by the author for use in this study. A higher score on the MYARQ reflected greater extent to which the respondent experienced acculturation problems. Therefore, lower MYARQ scores are associated with higher acculturation (i.e., lesser extent of acculturation problems) while higher scores imply lower acculturation (i.e., greater extent of acculturation problems). This was a descriptive study based on a nationally representative geographic sample of high school students in the U.S. The students were systematically selected based on the criteria of being Muslim. Results from the 144 respondents indicated statistical significance in three areas. Boys had higher scores on the MVARQ than die girls. Urdu and Arabic speakers had higher scores than English and Other speakers. and the longer the length of residence for lespondeui's father and mother. die higher die respondent's scores. The results from this study support previous research findings. However, new information also was found which may have potential impact on the study of acculturation trends especially among Muslim youth living in America.

Abstract = {While social identity challenges probably confront all school administrators, the authors focus on a doubly marginalized leadership population—Black female principals—whose experiences are rarely tapped. Based on lessons from this study and the literature reviewed, the authors think that leadership preparation programs should give prospective administrators opportunities to gain knowledge and develop skills relevant to navigating their leadership identities. In the age of accountability, and with the pressures placed on the education system to ensure the success of all students, school leaders are under constant scrutiny. The appearance, speech, body language, and interactions of principals with students, parents, teachers, and community members are dissected. Stretching to satisfy expectations, many principals find themselves trying to conform to a predefined image. Work pressures like these prove immeasurably intense for many Black women. Society has subscribed to certain beliefs about different groups, and these beliefs affect the roles, responsibilities, and identities of the individuals. They can have a positive or negative influence. Many principals have created professional identities that they have fine-tuned and learned to steer Trial and error has helped them learn identity-fitting techniques, while other principals may still be learning how to effectively manage people, address supporters and nonsupporters, and be politically savvy. Regardless of how they develop their identity, principals work toward inventing and branding themselves, fulfilling public identities (e.g., caregiver) and trying out new identities, such as commander-and-chief. Black female principals must navigate their identities as bicultural beings with different stakeholder groups and within work spaces that are traditionally geared to monocultural White males.

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the perception and psychosocial impact of caregiving for Latino family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and compare them to non-Hispanic (NH) white caregivers. Design/methodology/approach: The paper opted for a survey design using the Screen for Caregiver Burden, Perceived Stress Scale, Short Form 36 Health Survey, Symptom Questionnaire, Center for Epidemiologic Depression, Sense of Coherence, Coping Resources Inventory, and the Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ-85). A total of 202 participants with 53 Latino caregivers (majority were Mexican-Americans) and 149 NH white caregivers also completed an in-depth qualitative interview describing their experience as caregivers. Findings: Latino caregivers, as compared to NH white caregivers, have higher subjective and objective caregiver burden and lower general health, social function, and physical function. They also reported higher levels of bodily pain and somatic symptoms. Caregivers experience a great deal of stress that can adversely affect their emotional and physical well-being. Latino cultural values influence the meaning ascribed to caregiving and how caregivers attempt to balance a perceived duty to family. Research limitations/implications: The sample was a convenience sample of caregivers responding to an invitation to participate. The Latino sample included primarily caregivers of Mexican-American descent and represented Latinos living in the South West section of the USA. Future research needs to include Latinos of diverse nationalities. Practical implications: The paper points out crucial differences between NH white and Latino caregivers. Understanding how Latino cultural values influence how Latinos perform and feel about caregiving duties may facilitate support for caregivers. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to study Latino caregiving. Two bilingual and bicultural researchers were part of the research team facilitating the collection and analysis of qualitative data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

(CCSSCI). The project aimed to educate and inform participants (elderly, family caregivers and aged home-care workers) on issues relevant to ageing and dementia and to empower the elderly to use basic music therapy techniques at home to improve their mood and to improve the job satisfaction of their carers. The project is still on going. This article describes and explains both its development and the music therapy models that inform practice. The outcomes from developing this pilot project include five important considerations for cross-cultural work. These were 'familycentred practice,' 'culturally sensitive practice,' 'the need for bilingual-bicultural therapists,' 'the use of culturally specific music' and 'therapists as consultants and resource persons.' It is hoped that this discussion will be useful to clinicians working with older Chinese migrants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The volume consists of 10 chapters. Chapter 1 frames the rest of the book by providing an overview of the complex issues that influence the needs of bilingual children, particularly in a country such as the United States. Chapters 2 through 4 discuss cross-language transfer—that is, how the structure of one’s native language may (or may not) affect second language acquisition, as well as the biological bases of normative and aberrant language development. These are critical points because a bilingual child’s second language acquisition process is informed by prior language learning and neuropsychological processes, all of which can be affected by environmental factors. Beginning with Chapter 5 and continuing through Chapter 10, specific types of assessment are addressed. This section includes chapters addressing the use of norm-referenced measures in bilingual assessment, the use of response to intervention techniques, and social–emotional evaluation in a bilingual–bicultural context. Assessment of acculturation factors is discussed as well. Chapters 9 and 10 review data specific to key areas of learning that may be affected by second language acquisition processes: reading and writing. Finally, Chapter 11 considers the special case of refugee children whose uniquely significant experiences, in addition to requiring specialized consideration in the assessment process, provide an example of the complex interplay between biology, experience, and culture.

Abstract = {Efficacious treatments are only valuable to the extent that they are used. Given ethnic disparities in mental health service utilization, this preliminary study examined differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic White (NHW) adolescents’ ratings of the acceptability of depression treatments and related constructs. Female high school students (N = 67; 54% Hispanic) read a vignette describing a depressed adolescent and rated the acceptability of four single treatments for depression (i.e., cognitive–behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, family therapy, and pharmacotherapy) and three treatment combinations. Hispanic adolescents completed a self-report measure of acculturation and all adolescents were interviewed about their beliefs of the causes of depression. Results showed more similarities than differences between ethnic groups, with Hispanic and NHW adolescents favoring psychological treatments over pharmacotherapy. Among Hispanic participants, overall ratings of treatment acceptability were significantly higher for bicultural adolescents than Hispanic adolescents immersed predominantly in non-Hispanic culture. Hispanic and NHW adolescents generally showed similar beliefs about the causes of depression, with both groups endorsing personality and cognitions at high rates, but Hispanics were significantly less likely than NHWs to endorse trauma as a cause of depression. Implications for decreasing ethnic disparities in unmet need for treatment are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The current paper explores the salience and impact of ethnic and national identities for immigrants that are negotiating more than two cultures. Specifically, we were interested in the ways in which Jewish immigrant adolescents from the former Soviet Union integrate their Russian, Jewish, and American identities, and to what extent identification with these three cultures predicts adaptation to varied life domains. In order to examine whether being Jewish has an impact on salience and predictive value of Russian and American identities, a sample of Jewish adolescents (n = 100) was compared with a sample of non-Jewish (n = 113) adolescent immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The study suggests that Jewish and non-Jewish adolescent immigrants differ in levels of Russian and American identity. Further, using structural equation modeling a bicultural model for Jewish and non-Jewish adolescents was tested. The results suggest that these two groups do not differ with respect to how Russian and American identities impact on adjustment. However, adding Jewish identity to the model for the Jewish sample significantly improved model fit, and rendered some of the impact of Russian identity non-significant. Thus a multicultural model that included all three identities had better explanatory power for this sample than a bicultural one. Implications for the study of ethnic identity of immigrants, particularly those whose lives involve multiple cultural affiliations, are drawn.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the combinatorial effects of enduring and momentary mechanisms of cultural identity salience on identity-based apparel brand choices of three Hispanic acculturation segments (Hispanic-dominant, mainstream-dominant, and balanced-bicultural). The hypotheses were empirically tested among Hispanic students at a midwestern university in the U.S. employing a two-session online experiment. Results revealed that the influence of cultural primes (momentary salience of the cultural identity) on subsequent brand choices of Hispanic consumers is moderated by their bidimensional acculturation (enduring salience of the cultural identity). As posited, the current study found that the same cultural primes had differential effects among the three Hispanic acculturation segments, with the largest effect size among the balanced-bicultural segment. Specifically, the results indicated that Hispanic-dominant and mainstream-dominant consumers were less responsive to cultural cues in the environment and were less likely to demonstrate significant preference shifts in response to cultural primes. However, balanced-bicultural consumers demonstrated significant shifts in their attitudes and purchase intent for Hispanic and mainstream apparel brands when exposed to cultural primes, such that their brand choices assimilated toward the primed identity. Results are discussed in the context of social identity theory, the self-stereotyping process, cultural frame shifting, and the bidimensional acculturation model.

Abstract = {While strides have been made in providing underrepresented groups with more opportunities, there remain challenges prohibiting individuals from partaking in certain opportunities. This chapter identifies the limitations affecting one's ability to make the desired contributions. Some may be related to ethnic and cultural factors; others may reflect the sociocultural context. One component of success is an awareness of what one brings to a situation (beliefs, values, ethnicity, gender, etc.), as well as the ability to assess a situation. With increased awareness of the factors limiting opportunities, individuals may be able to more effectively employ strategies for success. Another intent of this chapter is to help individuals anticipate specific circumstances and handle the challenges that arise because of ethnic or cultural differences. Devoting attention to one's interactional style is important in developing appropriate coping strategies. This chapter also illuminates the challenges that Asian Americans face due to their bicultural worlds and addresses the importance of providing opportunities that enable people to achieve mutually shared goals.

Abstract = {In this chapter, we define and discuss the constructs of multiculturalism and multicultural identity from both an individual and societal perspective, and also quickly summarize the relevant issues in acculturation theory, from which current cultural identity research took its roots. Second, we identify some concerns in multicultural identity research, such as how to best measure and conceptualize this type of identity, and the issue of individual and group differences. With regard to the latter, we pay special attention to the construct of Bicultural Identity Integration (BII) and its correlates. The implications of multiculturalism research, particularly benefits for the individual as well as society at large, are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss the relevance of multicultural identity theory and research to other types of multiple identities (e.g., bisexual identity).

Abstract = {This study explores transformations in the cultural identities of a group of pre-service teachers from mainland China during their educational experiences in Hong Kong, and how these transformations subsequently impact their professional identity. Individual and focus group interviews were conducted with 16 cross-border pre-service teachers from a teacher education institution. Findings demonstrate that 1) the participants recast their extant ideologies and cultural beliefs in response to multiple influences in their new context, enabling them to move beyond pre-established teaching values to re-construct their teaching identity; and 2) some participants constructed a bicultural and multilingual identity to gain legitimacy in the host context. The findings indicate that a more supportive context that provides more room for cultural awareness should be co-constructed by local and non-local pre-service teachers, institutions and policy makers. The study extends understanding of the interconnected relations between teacher identity and historical and social discourses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Methods: 141 Hispanic and African American preadolescent girls (mean age = 11.1 years, SD = 1.5 years) participated. Most of the participants were of Hispanic origin, had a bicultural orientation, and were obese. Participants completed surveys assessing weight-related teasing, emotional eating, weight control behaviors, demographic, and acculturation characteristics. Body weight and height were also assessed. Hierarchical regression analyses were run to determine the associations among study variables. Results: Fifty-nine percent of participants reported being weight-related teased by peers and 42% participants reported weight-related teasing by parents. Weight-related teasing by parent was associated with emotional eating and binge eating, whereas peer weight-related teasing was only associated with emotional eating. Conclusions: Findings demonstrated the differential association of weight-related teasing from peers and parents to emotional and binge eating in minority girls.

Abstract = {The present article focused on two types of communicative intent (directing behaviour vs. eliciting talk) expressed by mothers and teenagers during everyday family interactions in Estonian, Finnish, and Swedish mono- and bicultural families. Three monocultural groups consisted of 17 Estonian, 19 Swedish, and 18 Finnish families living in their country of origin; two bicultural and bilingual groups consisted of 18 Estonian and 18 Finnish families residing in Sweden. All the children were between 9.0 and 13.0. The results revealed that the Estonian monocultural mothers were highly directive and direct: issuing behavioural directives most frequently and using the highest proportion of imperatives among all samples. Contrary to our expectations, the mothers who tended to be more concerned with controlling their children's behaviour also elicited conversation more frequently from teenagers by using a larger number of information requests. These requests seemed to serve as another form of attempted control over adolescents' behaviour--their communicative behaviour. The Swedish monocultural children were more active in controlling their mothers' behaviour than their counterparts, possibly illustrating the Swedish value of generational equality.

Participants were divided into 4 identity orientations (Chinese, American, bicultural, or other) and then assessed for differential patterns of mental health and community involvement. Chinese-centered identities were characterized by positive well-being and positive self-esteem. However, the American-centered and bicultural groups had well-being and self-esteem levels equal to that of the Chinese-centered group. Although the measures of menial health failed to differentiate the identity categories, both the Chinese- and bicultural-centered groups showed high involvement in Chinese culture, whereas American-centered participants were, significantly less involved.

Abstract = {Background: The perinatal period provides unique opportunities to identify and intervene with the co-occurrence of perinatal depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), and substance use problems. Psychosocial screening recommended for women seen in maternal child health settings tends to target single rather than multiple risk factors; there is limited research examining the co-occurrence of these issues especially in racially and ethnically diverse women across the perinatal period. These analyses explore the relationships of sociodemographic, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics in a large, diverse sample of women. Method: Women receiving perinatal services at routinely scheduled visits, including the 6-week postpartum visit, were recruited from 10 community obstetric/gynecologic clinics. Data were collected on perinatal depression, IPV, maternal substance use, and sociodemographic characteristics by bilingual, bicultural research assistants. Results: A total of 1868 women were screened, 1526 (82%) Latina, 1099 (58.8%) interviewed in Spanish; 20.4% (n = 382) screened positive for depressive symptoms based on an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of 10 or above, 20.9% reported harmful drinking, 4.3% reported drug use, 23% reported substance use problems, and 3.5% reported current or recent IPV. Women who were Black, Asian, Pacific Islander, or other race/ethnicity had greater odds for depressive symptoms relative to women who were Hispanic or Latino (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81, p = 0.005). Women reporting substance use problems (OR = 2.37, p < 0.0001) and IPV (OR = 3.98, p < 0.0001) had higher odds for depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a predominately Latina sample, 1 in 5 mothers (20.4%) screened positive for depressive symptoms and over one third (36.7%) reported one or more psychosocial issues during the perinatal period. Screening for multiple risk factors rather than just one can help clinicians tailor interventions for the successful management of psychosocial issues.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, The Immigrant Paradox in Children and Adolescents: Is Becoming American a Developmental Risk? by Cynthia García Coll and Kerivan Marks Amy (see record [rid]2011-09286-000[/rid]). The primary implication from this book is that it can be helpful to find out the history of any family’s immigration experience to provide effective and responsive services. Practitioners can take advantage of the optimism and determination of the first-generation immigrants and help them to recognize and maintain those assets. Programs can help support the bilingual and bicultural qualities of first- and second-generation immigrants in particular. One way to do that is to try to identify ways that such families can fend off and protect themselves from aspects of the U.S. environment that could prove detrimental during the assimilation process. Because of their marginalization and isolation, the voices of the immigrant community are rarely heard, and many of their needs may go unrecognized. One of the most powerful things a practitioner can do is to involve representatives from the immigrant community to assist with program development and delivery. The voices of insiders are critical to effective family life education and casework. Such representatives provide both information and networks that will make programs more likely to be effective. This book is timely—current and relevant to today’s challenges and needs. But it is not the final word on anything. As one author stated, ‘‘We just need to recognize that what we do not know or understand about the immigrant paradox still outweighs what we do know, a recognition that lays out a research agenda for the future’’ (p. 73). There are calls to action for child and family researchers, policy advocates, and practitioners. Hopefully, we will respond to those calls, making this volume soon out of date.

Abstract = {In a series of interviews with leading cross-cultural management (CCM) educators, we examine the state of the CCM field within business education. We invited eight prominent scholars and executive educators to consider the following main questions: What is the role of cross-cultural management in business curricula? What challenges do we face teaching this material? How can we create an engaged learning environment with the diverse audiences we encounter in our classrooms, and what theoretical frameworks best support these efforts? Last what is the future of cross-cultural management education? What changes and challenges can we expect? The learnings that emerged from our interviews are grouped around three main themes: the content of what we teach, our understanding of audiences with whom we work and their evolving expectations of cross-cultural management education, and the role, preparation, background and assumptions of the educators. This series of interviews contributes to highlight current trends in cross-cultural management education: a shift in content from knowledge to conditions of knowledge creation, a transition from monocultural audiences toward biculturals and global cosmopolitans, and finally, educators' changing responsibility from providing knowledge to developing and honing responsible, tolerant, and resilient global citizens.

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review three cultural concepts (acculturation, ethnic identity, bicultural self-efficacy) and their relationship to the known risk and protective factors associated with youth violence. We conducted a review of the relevant literature that addresses these three cultural concepts and the relationship among culture, violent behavior, and associated cognition. The available literature suggests that ethnic identity and bicultural self-efficacy can be best thought of as protective factors, whereas acculturation can be a potential risk factor for youth violence. We examine the connection between these cultural concepts and the risk and protective factors described in the 2001 Surgeon General's Report on Youth Violence, and present a summary table with cultural risk and protective factors for violence prevention. These concepts can assist physicians in identifying risk and protective factors for youth violence when working with multicultural adolescents and their families. Physicians are more effective at providing appropriate referrals if they are aware that navigating among different cultures influences adolescent behavior.

Abstract = {Parent cultural adaptation and preschool behavioral and socioemotional functioning were examined in a community sample of urban families from diverse cultural backgrounds. Participants were 130 families of children (mean age = 4.1 years) attending eight public Pre-Kindergarten programs in urban communities. Parents completed a measure of cultural adaptation that taps into acculturation and enculturation, and teachers reported on children's externalizing problems, internalizing problems and adaptive behavior in the classroom. Parents' ethnic identity was a significant predictor of children's functioning. The retention of parents' culture of origin and specific aspects of acculturation are related to positive outcomes in a sample of culturally diverse families of preschoolers living in urban communities. Bicultural parents (those with high ethnic and US American identity) had children with lower levels of internalizing problems and higher levels of adaptive behavior relative to parents who were not bicultural. Implications for enhancing positive child outcomes through the promotion of parental ethnic identity are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this commentary, I outline the common and distinctive components in the cultural adaptation studies in this special issue and compare cultural adaptations with universalistic and culture-specific perspectives. The term cultural attunement may be more reflective than cultural adaptation insofar as the cultural additions in these studies make the treatments more accessible by adding language translation, cultural values, and contextual stressors. These additions most likely enhance the level of engagement and retention in therapy for Latino families. The work ahead requires a deeper examination of the cultural theories of psychological distress and the cultural theories of change in therapy. A final proposal is made in this commentary for considering the bicultural aspects of the cultural adaptation or attunement enterprise, insofar as the clinical research encounters with immigrants are bicultural encounters. These encounters can reach beyond the notion of cultural "adaptation" of mainstream evidence based treatments to ethnic minorities and present a unique opportunity for mutually enriching bicultural integration of theory, research, and practice.

Abstract = {Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy of Entre Dos Mundos/Between Two Worlds (EDM) prevention for Latino adolescents. Method: In an experimental trial to compare implementation formats, 41 Latino families were randomly assigned to EDM action-oriented skills training groups, and 47 families were randomly assigned to unstructured EDM support groups. Both groups addressed identical EDM session themes. Results: No significant differences between the intervention delivery methods were found; both EDM groups showed improvements. Statistically significant dosage effects occurred from pretest to posttest. Controlling for pretest scores, family income, parent education, and time spent in the United States, parents who attended more group sessions reported significant decreases in their adolescent child’s aggression, oppositional defiant behavior, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and attention problems, with concomitant gains in family adaptability, bicultural support, and bicultural identity integration. Effect sizes for high-dosage families were moderate to large. Conclusions: Initial evidence suggests that EDM is efficacious for immigrant Latino adolescents.

Abstract = {Depression is one of the most prevalent health problems for immigrants in the United States (U.S.) and it has been associated with the process of acculturation. A cross-sectional study was conducted to identify subgroups of Korean immigrant women based on their Korean as well as American acculturation levels using cluster analysis and to determine whether these subgroups differ on depressive symptoms in 200 Korean immigrant women aged 20–64. Cluster analysis identified four as the most appropriate number of subgroups: they were designated as Korean cluster (45%), Marginalized cluster (26%), American cluster (22%), and Bicultural cluster (7%). Korean cluster had high scores on Korean acculturation and low American acculturation, Marginalized had low for both, American had high scores on American acculturation, low for Korean acculturation, and Bicultural had high scores for both. Women in the Marginalized subgroup reported significantly higher depression scores than women in the American and Korean clusters. It is important to identify immigrants who do not relate to either their heritage culture or the new host culture and address their mental health risk issues.

Abstract = {This chapter examines the theoretical construct of biculturalism from a socialization perspective and focuses on children and adolescents who come from environments that foster dual-culture socialization. A gap in the literature on socialization is at the heart of this chapter. The implicit assumption in socialization research is that children are enculturated into a single culture; therefore, culture is not salient in understanding socialization processes because if everyone has nearly the same experience, then differences that occur between children and socializing agents are not due to culture per se. When culture has taken on relevance in socialization research, it has been in the form of cross-cultural research that aims to compare the socialization practices of two or more distinct cultural groups to determine how differences in child-rearing affect some aspect of a child's behavior (Chao, 1996). The traditional view of socialization (Maccoby & Martin, 1983) does not take into account the fact that many individuals are members of two cultural groups and that their socialization may involve intergenerational transmission to two cultural orientations (Haritatos & Benet-Martinez, 2002). Bicultural socialization may occur simultaneously, as in the case of a child who is socialized to one culture by one parent and to another culture by the other parent, or by one cultural perspective from parents and another from grandparents and other family members (Silverstein & Chen, 1999). Another way that dual socialization occurs early in a child's life is when parents adhere to the lifestyle of one culture at home and teachers practice another culture at school. This "growing up" in two cultures and bicultural transmission is the theme of this chapter. I first discuss why growing up in two cultures and becoming bicultural is a timely and necessary topic for discussion in understanding developmental processes in cultural transmission. To understand this point, it is necessary to present information on the changing demographic profile of the United States. The intent is to show how immigration is recasting the "face" of America and to suggest that there are sizeable numbers of immigrants and their children who wish to hold onto their heritage culture. From this flows the second major topic, which addresses the conditions that favor heritage cultural socialization that result in bicultural development. Third, I discuss the theoretical issues that relate to ethnic socialization that are critical to bicultural development. Finally, a review of the empirical literature is presented that enables a better understanding of the variations in the transmission of culture across generations.

Abstract = {People are being exposed to second cultures in growing numbers, yet the role played by second-culture exposure in shaping sociocognitive skills has received little theoretical attention. The authors address this gap by exploring the relationship between acculturation strategies and integrative complexity. Consistent with the acculturation complexity model, studies of both Asian American college students (Study 1) and Israelis working in the United States (Study 2) show that biculturals are more integratively complex across domains (e.g., culture, work) than either assimilated or separated individuals. Using priming manipulations to clarify the directional flow of causality between acculturation and integrative complexity, the authors also find that greater integrative complexity among biculturals is driven by acculturation pressures (Study 3). Finally, the authors discuss the adaptive implications of multiculturalism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2003), the Latino population represents 42.7 million of the total population. Most recent estimates by the Pew Hispanic Center (2006) indicate that 44.7 million of the 300 million people living in the United States of America are of Hispanic origin. Close to 40% of the Latino population are largely Spanish speakers. Another number of bilingual Hispanics prefer to address emotional and family issues in the Spanish language. There is a plethora of literature regarding counseling English-speaking Latinos and Latinas, but information about working with Spanish-speaking Hispanic clients is rare. Subsequently there is a need not just for competent multicultural clinicians but also for multilingual service providers in all areas of life, including physical and mental health. Despite a lack of clinical support on the efficacy of cross-cultural counseling and family therapy practice, it is nevertheless safe to believe that multicultural sensitive practitioners need to provide services in a manner congruent with the culture of the client. In this chapter, the authors argues the need to increase the number of bilingual and bicultural mental health providers who are competent in evaluating, diagnosing, and treating Hispanic clients, and the need to develop effective and affordable models of mental health services for Latinas and Latinos.

Abstract = {This chapter is an inquiry extrapolating from our understanding of the Chinese psyche by considering the immigration experience and its impact on the emerging second generation of Chinese Americans, typically referred to as "ABCs"—American-born Chinese. The Chinese American family can choose three distinct paths: first, to assimilate into American society, adopting Western cultural constructs of independence and shedding the behaviors and beliefs associated with the native culture. Second, to forgo assimilation and acculturation processes, choosing perhaps to live within ethnic enclaves and associating solely with Chinese immigrants; and third, to attempt to be bicultural, not assimilating but rather going through an acculturation process that attempts to integrate aspects of both Western and Eastern cultures. All three methods of development have their challenges and this chapter focuses upon this last group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {A behavioral signature of cross-cultural competence is discriminative use of culturally appropriate behavioral strategies in different cultural contexts. Given the central role communication plays in cross-cultural adjustment and adaptation, the present investigation examines how meta-knowledge of culture—defined as knowledge of what members of a certain culture know—affects culturally competent cross-cultural communication. We reported two studies that examined display of discriminative, culturally sensitive use of cross-cultural communication strategies by bicultural Hong Kong Chinese (Study 1), Chinese students in the United States and European Americans (Study 2). Results showed that individuals formulating a communicative message for a member of a certain culture would discriminatively apply meta-knowledge of the culture. These results suggest that unsuccessful cross-cultural communications may arise not only from the lack of motivation to take the perspective of individuals in a foreign culture, but also from inaccurate meta-knowledge of the foreign culture.

Abstract = {Purpose: This study explored how often sound-field amplification and personal frequency-modulated (FM) systems are used in preschool classrooms, teacher perceptions of advantages and disadvantages of using hearing assistive technology, and teacher recommendations for hearing assistive technology use. Method: The study used a cross-sectional survey design. Participants were professionals who provided services to preschool-age children who are deaf or hard of hearing in public or private schools. A total of 306 surveys were sent to 162 deaf education programs throughout the United States; 99 surveys were returned (32%). Simple statistics were used to describe the quantitative survey results; content analysis was completed on open-ended survey comments. Results: Surveys were received from teachers working at listening and spoken language preschool programs (65%) and at bilingual–bicultural and total communication preschool programs (35%). Most respondents perceived that hearing assistive technology improved students’ academic performance, speech and language development, behavior, and attention in the classroom. The majority of respondents also reported that they definitely would or probably would recommend a sound-field system (77%) or personal FM system (71%) to other educators. Conclusion: Hearing assistive technology is frequently used in preschool classrooms of children who are deaf or hard of hearing, with generally positive teacher perceptions of the benefits of using such technology.

Abstract = {Building upon recent research that defines psychological development as a continuous process of sense-making situated within a cultural and historical context, this paper explores how culturally diverse youth growing up in New York City use evaluative language to enact relational complexity as they make sense of technologically mediated interpersonal interactions with their peers. Forty-four individuals (ages 15–20) participated in a quasi-experimental research workshop that engaged them in the process of sense-making by asking them to write projective narratives toward a vignette depicting text-massage mediated interpersonal interaction embedded among monocultural and bicultural group of peers. Data analyses focus on evaluative devices used by youth and manifest the relational flexibility of sense-making by immigrant youth and their U.S. born peers across diverse relational dimensions. Results suggest that immigrant youth are able to coordinate diverse ways of interpreting interpersonal interactions across relational dimensions, manifest by varied use of logical/hypothetical, causal and affective evaluative devices. In contrast U.S. born youth largely use same frequency of evaluative devices across two relational dimensions. Statistical analysis highlights the use of affect in projective narratives by exploring a discursive learning hypothesis: that higher use of emotions in the process of sense-making by U.S. born youth gradually scaffolds the use of emotions in narrative by immigrant youth.

In an overall sample of 2,935 clients served in the western region of Melbourne from 1997-1999, ethnic minority clients from a non-English-speaking background who received services from a bilingual, bicultural case manager were compared with ethnic minority clients who did not receive such services and with clients from an English-speaking background. The clients' engagement with 3 types of services was assessed: community care teams, psychiatric crisis teams, and psychiatric inpatient services. Compared with ethnic minority clients who were not matched with a bilingual clinician, those who were matched generally had a longer duration and greater frequency of contact with community care teams and a shorter duration and lower frequency of contact with crisis teams. Clients born in Vietnam who were matched with a bilingual clinician had a shorter annual mean length of hospital stay and a lower annual mean frequency of hospital admission than Australian-born clients.

Abstract = {Four theoretical models that may explain the effects of acculturation and language use on delinquency were examined based on a sample of Chinese Canadian youths (aged 10–20 yrs old). They were social control, personal dysfunction, culture conflict, and bicultural models. The results revealed that acculturation increased delinquency involvement whereas bilingualism reduced it, particularly for foreign born respondents. These findings lent some support to the social control and bicultural models. However, the observed correlations between acculturation and social control factors were weak, and acculturation still showed an independent effect on delinquency after controlling for social control, thus suggesting that social control may not explain the effect of acculturation on delinquency. Put together, the results were most consistent with the bicultural model and pointed to the importance of balancing adherence to one's ethnic culture and acculturation to the host society.

Ss with culturally hearing identities tended to have become deaf later in life than those with culturally deaf identities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The authors present a new approach to culture and cognition, which focuses on the dynamics through which specific pieces of cultural knowledge (implicit theories) become operative in guiding the construction of meaning from a stimulus. Whether a construct comes to the fore in a perceiver's mind depends on the extent to which the construct is highly accessible (because of recent exposure). In a series of cognitive priming experiments, the authors simulated the experience of bicultural individuals (people who have internalized two cultures) of switching between different cultural frames in response to culturally laden symbols. The authors discuss how this dynamic, constructivist approach illuminates (1) when cultural constructs are potent drivers of behavior and (2) how bicultural individuals may control the cognitive effects of culture.

Abstract = {Examined the bilingual and bicultural identity and concomitant problems of kikokushijo, children of Japanese expatriates who return to Japan after a prolonged sojourn abroad. In the longitudinal study 4 kikokushijo (aged 17–18 yrs) completing high school in Toronto completed 2–3 interviews prior to leaving Canada and follow-up interviews every 6 mo for 2 yrs following their return to Japan. Identified common themes include adjustment difficulties, misfit identities, and ambivalent cultural and ethnic allegiance; each S coped differently. Despite the now prevalent view that little discrimination against kikokushijo remains, schools in both the host and home countries still tend to fault them for what they do not know, while giving little recognition to their bilingual and bicultural abilities. Findings suggest that factors that impede the adjustment of kikokushijo may come from both society and themselves; some kikokushijo refuse to identify with the society in which they live, thereby adding to their own isolation.

Abstract = {Investigated whether persons with a well-developed sense of interdependence or independence could be described as bicultural. 120 participants (aged 12–89 yrs) were selected to represent the 4 patterns of self-construal (bicultural, Western, traditional, and culturally-alienated). It was predicted that on a measure of self-construal, the mean scores of the respondents in the 4 groups would differ in strength with the bicultural experience group, in particular, exhibiting both a high independent and a high interdependent score on a measure of self-construals. Results show that in terms of independent self-construal, the bicultural and Western groups scored significantly higher than the traditional and alienated groups. For the interdependent self-construal, the traditional and bicultural groups scored significantly higher than the Western and alienated groups. The bicultural group was the only group to score significantly higher on both types of construals. It is concluded that the availability of both types of self-construal may facilitate communication and adaptive behaviors for persons interacting in multiple cultures.

Abstract = {We used data from two telephone-administered health surveys to explore African Americans’ preferences for interviewer race. The first survey utilized African American interviewers to assess ethnic identity and aspects of healthy eating among 617 African American adults. In the second survey, interviewers of varying races queried 534 African American adults about their motivations to eat healthier. The motivation survey contained almost no racial content, whereas 40% of the ethnic identity survey assessed racial content. Using only ethnic identity survey data, we found that respondents with Afrocentric or Black American identity components were more likely to prefer African American interviewers than respondents with solely assimilated, bicultural, or multicultural identity components. Ethnic identity survey respondents were also more likely to prefer racially/ethnically matched interviewers than motivation survey respondents. Ethnic identity respondents with a college or graduate degree reported lower hypothetical comfort with a white interviewer than respondents with a high school education.

Abstract = {To obtain a more nuanced, emic look at the practice, role, and perceived benefits of religion/spirituality among Latino caregivers than has been possible with forced-choice measures, we posed an open-ended survey question to informal caregivers of Mexican descent. Fifty-eight caregivers described how their spiritual beliefs and practices have been important or meaningful in their role as a caregiver. Inductive thematic analyses conducted by a bilingual-bicultural coder (and confirmed by a secondary coder) yielded six thematic categories (e.g., Methods of Religious or Spiritual Practice, Timing of Practices, Beliefs/Spiritual Perspective as Related to Providing Care, How Religious/Spiritual Beliefs and Practices Help Caregiving). Findings clarify why religious/spiritual involvement seems to have a consistently beneficial effect for Latino caregivers. For example, interviews revealed a reliance on positive forms of religious coping; emphasis on personal engagement and private practice; incorporation of religiosity/spirituality into the daily stream of life; perceived connection of religion/spirituality to family; and experience of close attachment to God, some other divine being, or an affirming spiritual order. We discuss implications for Latino caregiver well-being, interventions, and research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Approaches to working with culturally diverse populations require sensitivity to and knowledge of the context, historical experience, and evolving identity of various socio-cultural and ethnic groups. This exploratory qualitative study examines how the 1.5 generation of Hmong in higher education make meaning of the trauma of the Secret War in Laos as a part of their identity and current lives in the United States. The Secret War trauma and subsequent forced migration left many older Hmong traumatized, and may predispose the 1.5-generation Hmong to secondary traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The current study was guided by the principles of hermeneutic phenomenology as described by Van Manen (1990). Thematic analysis was used for coding. A small group of 1.5-generation Hmong was interviewed individually and as a focus group. Four themes emerged in the study: the continued clandestineness of the Secret War, shared hardship, gratefulness, and bicultural identity. This study gives a snapshot of the complex legacy of grief for lost family, a sense of exclusion from mainstream society, and gratitude to parents that is a hallmark of many young Hmong-Americans. Adjusting to both their own Hmong culture and mainstream American culture appears difficult and confusing in many ways to the 1.5 generation in higher education. At the same time, the Hmong often struggle with their traumatic past history, which is generally not recognized by mainstream society. This current study suggests that the struggle to define oneself as Hmong-American with all of its implications remains significant for the 1.5-generation Hmong and has implications for social work practice.

This article also reports on data from a subset of participants (n = 27) that self-identified as bilingual, bicultural, and highly culturally competent from a larger mixed-methods study of 89 Latina/o therapists. The results support the utility of personalismo, respeto, charlar (small talk), language and education, and self-disclosure in building respectful relationships with, and in conducting the initial interview with Latina/o clients.

Abstract = {It has been proposed that mate value influences both the mate selection process and the quality of a romantic relationship once it has been formed. The aim of this study was to test the relations among perceived own and partner’s mate value and relationship satisfaction. As a relationship is a dynamic process, in which assessments made by 1 member of the pair are not independent of the assessments made by the other member, we used an actor–partner interdependence model to test how one’s assessments of own and partner’s mate value (actor effects), along with his or her partner’s assessments of own and partner’s mate value (partner effects), combine to predict relationship satisfaction. To explore the possible effect of cultural context on the structure of relations among those variables, we conducted the study in 2 rather different cultures: Iran and Croatia. Not surprisingly, there were culture- and gender-related differences in mate value assessments. However, the structure of the relations among these assessments and relationship satisfaction was similar in 2 cultures, confirming the evolutionary hypothesis about the universal relevance of mate value in pair bonding. Specifically, the models showed that in both cultures the actor’s own effects are stronger than the partner’s ones, and that one’s estimate of partner’s quality as a mate is generally the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction. The results are discussed in terms of both culturally contingent perceptions of own and partner’s mate value and a more universal underlying mechanism (feeling of satisfaction as a function of partner’s mate value).

Follow-up procedures to the ANOVAs revealed that bicultural Latinos obtained significantly higher scores on social interest and lower scores on depression when compared to the high and low acculturation level groups. The results suggest that biculturality is the stage of acculturation that is least detrimental to Latinos' mental health and the ability to fit within a host culture.

It finds that second generation Patel women and men reject alike their parents’ perception of dating as non-Indian behavior and the American perception of dating as healthy fun. Rather, Patel women and men have reconceptualized dating in a manner that appeals to their identities as Indian-Americans. Accordingly, dating for them is not only a means of exploring their preferences in intimate partnering, but must necessarily have an end goal binding it – namely marriage. Gender structures within the Patel community create differential dating experiences for Patel women and men. In response, Patel women and men have devised strategies in their dating behaviors evinced in their partner selections, age at onset of dating, their employing of secrecy in dating, and utilizing particular semantics of dating.

Abstract = {The article discusses how adolescents interpret their relationships with their parents in two different cultural contexts. Interpersonal conflicts have been largely studied to understand adolescent– parent relationships across different cultural groups, including immigrant families who are often caught between bicultural values and expectations. The balancing act of reconciling values of the “culture of origin” with values of the “culture of destination” is likely to create discrepant views between parents and adolescents. What kind of everyday disagreements occur between parents and adolescents in two distinctly different cultures—India and the United States (US)? How are these disagreements resolved? To what extent are adolescents able to take parents’ perspectives in interpreting and resolving disagreements? How do the perspectives of Indian adolescents compare with those of the Indian immigrant adolescents? These research questions were addressed through individual interviews of 40 adolescents in Baroda, India and New York, US. The results indicate that adolescents in both societies experience everyday disagreements related to regulation of behaviour/activities and interpersonal relations, academics, chores and finance. Mutual accommodation and adolescent compromise were the commonly used strategies of resolving disagreements. More adolescents from the Indian group acknowledged their responsibility to accommodate to parents on account of faith in parents’ experience, respect for them and the belief that parents have children’s welfare at heart. Although adolescents from both groups also endorsed the need for parent accommodation to adolescent views, parent compromise featured more in the Indian immigrant group.

Abstract = {In the context of the current identity discussions, the interrelations between acculturations, psychological resources, and self-esteem as well as the satisfaction with life of deaf and hard-of-hearing people (N = 629) were examined by means of a questionnaire-based survey. To check these interrelations, one-factor and two-factor analyses of variance were employed. The results show that bicultural, deaf, and hearing acculturation styles have the advantage over marginal acculturation, but the results for marginal acculturation need to be discussed in depth to ensure a comprehensive understanding of them. All in all, bicultural acculturation seems to be a secure option for psychosocial well-being. The availability of psychological resources (optimism, self-efficacy) seems to be of special importance for the quality of self-esteem and satisfaction with life. On the other hand, the power of these psychological resources is closely associated with good communicative conditions in the individual biographies of the participants in this study as well as with their education level. Going beyond a methodological discussion then, the mission for educators would seem to be one of making good communicative conditions available to each deaf or hard-of-hearing child and optimizing academic achievement so as to ensure a secure, comprehensive, and differentiated opening up of the world and psychological empowerment. In this way, a good foundation can be laid for developing quality of life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Acculturation has been linked to an increased prevalence of alcohol-related problems. However, most of the research has been conducted with Hispanic populations in metropolitan areas of the United States, none of which is on the U.S.-Mexico border. This study examines the association between acculturation, heavy episodic drinking, and DSM-IV alcohol abuse and dependence among Hispanics in the Texas-Mexico border. Methods: The study used data from a survey conducted (2002 to 2003) along the Texas-Mexico border and included 472 male and 484 female Hispanic adults from El Paso, the Rio Grande Valley, and colonias. Based on the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II scale, respondents were coded into 4 acculturation categories: "very Mexican oriented," "Mexican bicultural," "Anglo bicultural," or "very Anglo/Anglicized." Results: Acculturation was related to lower rates of alcohol use disorders among men and a higher frequency of heavy episodic drinking among women. Multivariate analyses indicate that men who report heavy episodic drinking and those who are "very Mexican,"bicultural Mexican," or "bicultural Anglo" are more at higher risk for alcohol abuse and/or dependence compared with "very Anglo/Anglicized" men. For women, acculturation level did not predict alcohol disorders. Statistical analyses included testing for bivariate associations and multivariate logistic regression predicting heavy episodic drinking alcohol abuse or dependence. Conclusions: This study suggests that acculturation has different effects on drinking for men and women. This finding needs some attention as literature also indicates that women drink more and may develop more alcohol-related problems as they acculturate. This increase in women's drinking is probably because of U.S. society's more liberal norms governing female drinking. The "bimodal" distribution of risk, in which only men in "very Anglo" group are at a lower risk than the others, may be unique to the Border. The association between acculturation and alcohol use disorders does not appear to be linear and the effect of acculturation is not uniform on individuals' drinking behavior.

Abstract = {Southeast Asian adolescents in the United States face the daily challenge of adjusting to the American culture and their culture of origin. However, little is known about how the patterns of their bicultural adjustment influence psychological symptoms, especially when faced with other challenges such as community violence and negative life events. Additionally, the overrepresentation of Southeast Asian youth in the mental health and juvenile justice systems also necessitates a deeper understanding of the adjustment of this group of adolescents. Data from a sample of 80 Vietnamese and Cambodian adolescents who were between 13 and 18 years old revealed high rates of community violence witnessing and victimization, and a moderate level of negative life events. All of these stressors were related to higher externalizing and trauma-related symptoms, but only violence victimization and negative life events were related to higher internalizing symptoms. There was an additive effect of higher bicultural orientation related to lower externalizing and traumatic-stress symptoms in the face of stress and violence exposure, but no moderation effects were found.

Using a person-centered approach, meaningful typologies of cultural orientation were derived for fathers, mothers, and adolescents. Overall, results provided support, though qualified, for the notion that generational dissonance is linked to depressive symptoms through decreased supportive parenting. In general, having a parent with a bicultural profile seemed to be most advantageous if adolescents similarly had a bicultural profile, whereas more American oriented adolescents with more Chinese oriented parents reported the least supportive parenting and most depressive symptoms. Directions for future research and the benefits of using a person-centered approach in research of acculturation and generational dissonance are discussed.

A total of 291 Ss provided information about their sociocultural backgrounds and their cultural experiences, and they rated how characteristic each of 120 trait-attributes was of themselves, their native cultural group, and their nonnative cultural group. Comparisons between monocultural and bicultural groups revealed a reaffirmation effect. Compared with monoculturals, biculturals saw themselves as more similar to their native cultural group, they evaluated that particular group's attributes more positively, and they saw the 2 cultural groups as less similar to each other.

In this article, we introduce the concept of biculturalism and provide the foundation necessary for understanding literature on this topic, beginning research in this area, and recognizing biculturalism in everyday life. In unpacking the construct of biculturalism, we first define it along with its components and related constructs (e.g. acculturation strategies). Second, we compare and discuss various ways of measuring biculturalism (e.g. unidimensional versus bidimensional models). Third, we organize and summarize the limited literature on individual differences in bicultural identity, focusing on the construct of Bicultural Identity Integration (Benet-Martínez & Haritatos, 2005). Lastly, we review the possible outcomes resulting from biculturalism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Studies worldwide point toward increased risk of mental health issues among immigrants. Immigrants’ ability to integrate the cultural identity of their new country has been found to be a key factor in their psychological well-being. Even though researchers agree on the crucial role of identity integration in immigrants’ well-being, the current literature has two main limitations: (1) researchers do not agree on the importance that should be allocated to each of the cultural identities, and (2) research has focused on bicultural individuals as opposed to multicultural individuals. The present paper proposes to study Canadians immigrants living in the province of Quebec who, because of the political and linguistic situation of the province, face the challenge of integrating two new cultural identities (Quebecer and Canadian) to their original one. Specifically, cluster analysis was used to observe identity profiles that naturally emerge among 120 Canadian immigrants from the province of Quebec. Identity profiles were then compared on various indices of well-being to identify the optimal identity structure. In total, four identity profiles emerged, differing in their levels of identity coherence (i.e., similar levels of identification with each group) and identification to either the original group or the Quebecers. ANOVA results confirmed that identity profiles differed in their average level of well-being. First, immigrants with coherent profiles displayed higher levels of well-being. Second, among incoherent profiles, the profile where identification to the original group is the highest showed the greatest well-being. Implications suggest that in order to maximize immigrants’ well-being, psychologists should focus on the coherence between cultural groups as well as identification to the original group.

Abstract = {Today’s most pressing social challenges require people to recognize their shared fate and work together—to think and act interdependently. In the three studies reported here, we found that appeals for increased interdependence may undermine the very motivation they seek to inspire. We examined the hypothesis that invoking interdependent action undermines motivation for chronically independent European Americans but not for bicultural Asian Americans who are both chronically independent and chronically interdependent. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that priming interdependent rather than independent action undermined European Americans’ motivation to perform challenging mental and physical tasks. Study 3 showed that framing an appeal for environmental sustainability in terms of interdependent rather than independent action led to decreased motivation and resource allocation among European Americans. Motivation was not undermined for Asian Americans, which reveals how behavior is divergently shaped, in the land of the free, by foundational sociocultural schemas of independence and interdependence. This research has the novel implication that it may be necessary to invoke independent behaviors in order to successfully motivate interdependence.

Abstract = {On the surface, it appears that bilinguals may have a distinct disadvantage in terms of cognitive functioning early in their developmental process. However, as the individual develops, this deficit evolves into a cognitive asset. Specifically, there is a growing body of evidence that indicates that as development evolves, greater efficiency in executive function develops. Hence, bilingualism is either a deterring or as a facilitating variable depending on the developmental stage when the measurement occurs. It could be that for a younger individual, then, bilingualism has a diminutive effect on cognitive functioning, whereas for the older individual, bilingualism may have a facilitating or potentiating effect on executive functioning. Balanced bilinguals who learn English second may develop less-effective technical dominance which, in turn, may result in a reduction of scores on tests that reflect such a domain as is the case in many standardized tests. Hence, one could erroneously conclude that the individual is "motivated" but "cognitively limited" when in reality it could both be a reflection of a true lack of a balanced bilingual person's abilities as well as simply measurement error. The issue then becomes how to tease out the potential confounds, to be clear with what one is measuring, and to realize that Spanish and English are not "equivalent" languages, like possibly English and German as both are more technically sensitive languages. Failing to understand that Spanish is more sensitive to social and emotional issues and that English is more sensitive to technical ones would allow for an appreciation that one needs to understand that bilingualism is only the beginning of understanding biculturalism. The main issue then is to determine clearly what the construct in question is and to make sure that the linguistic issue do not dominate or supersede the careful measurement of all aspects of psychological functioning, especially social and emotional ones where psychologists have historically lagged behind relative to cognitive assessment. Finally, it could be that whenever the discussion begins to change from strictly bilingual assessment to understanding the effects of culture, then the focus on what construct is being measured may reconceptualize the problem. That is, if bilingualism is the first step in understanding biculturalism and its measurement, then reducing measurement error in bilingual assessment is critical. Similarly important is that once this is controlled, then the focus should shift to understanding how being bicultural is more of a meta-construct that more carefully addresses how individuals from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds perform on psychological tests. And when this is addressed, one wonders whether the historic disadvantage on cognitive tests during early development indicating that Hispanics are less able will shift to understand how this initial disability eventually turns into a long-term cognitive advantage.

Additionally, RAs assessed tool feasibility with five MA women to determine its usefulness for a later study. The translation process resulted in a distress assessment instrument suitable for use in a low-literacy, Spanish-speaking population.

This new edition is not a mere revision of the earlier text, being thematically and structurally different enough that reading both editions is recommended. The subtitle of the first edition was 'A Guide for Americans' in contradistinction to the new version's 'Going to Work in Japan', a difference suggestive of both a broadening and a narrowing of scope. Broadening in that the new edition transcends the bicultural, contrastive theme of its predecessor, and narrowing in that its target readership is more sharply defined as prospective employees. There is throughout the text a refreshing lack of academic jargon, and the material is presented in elegant prose that describes complex concepts with admirable clarity. Condon and Masumoto have wisely attempted to provide only the most general guidelines for working in Japan. And in spite of its subtitle's implication that this is a text for prospective workers, anyone with an interest in Japan would benefit from this book, if only as an indispensable introductory guide while waiting for the authors to produce the authoritative, comprehensive text on Japan's distinct yet increasingly fissiparous culture.

Abstract = {Biculturalism (having two cultures) is a growing social phenomenon that has received considerable attention in psychology in the last decade; however, the issue of what impact (if any) biculturalism has on individuals’ adjustment remains empirically unclear. To answer this question, we conducted a meta-analysis that included 83 studies, 322 rs, and 23,197 participants. Results based on the random-effects approach show a significant, strong, and positive association between biculturalism and adjustment (both psychological and sociocultural). This biculturalism-adjustment link is stronger than the association between having one culture (dominant or heritage) and adjustment. Thus, our results clearly invalidate early sociological accounts of this phenomenon, which portrayed bicultural individuals as “marginal” and stumped between two worlds. Analyses also indicate that the association between biculturalism and adjustment is moderated by how acculturation is measured, the adjustment domain, and sample characteristics.

Abstract = {Prior research has documented cultural dimensions that broadly characterize between-culture variations in Western and East Asian societies and that bicultural individuals can flexibly change their behaviors in response to different cultural contexts. In this article, we studied cultural differences and behavioral switching in the context of the fast emerging, naturally occurring online social networking, using both self-report measures and content analyses of online activities on two highly popular platforms, Facebook and Renren (the “Facebook of China”). Results showed that while Renren and Facebook are two technically similar platforms, the Renren culture is perceived as more collectivistic than the Facebook culture. Furthermore, we presented evidence for the first time that users who are members of both online cultures flexibly switch and adapt their in-group sharing behaviors in response to the online community in which they are: They perform more benevolent in-group sharing when they participate in the Renren community and less so when they participate in the Facebook community. We discussed both the theoretical and methodological implications of the current research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

(2001), Lessons learned from 23 years of a Deaf psychiatric inpatient unit: Part 2. JADARA, 44(2), 82-100. The Deaf Unit at Westborough State Hospital was a specialty psychiatric inpatient unit for deaf persons established in a state mental hospital in Massachusetts in January, 1987. The vision that guided the creation of this unit was that of a "culturally affirmative" treatment program for deaf persons (Glickman & Zitter, 1989). This meant creating, as much as we could, a Deaf space, with American Sign Language (ALS) used as the language of treatment, large numbers of deaf staff at all levels of the organization, and a Deaf sensitivity brought to everything we did. The unit never relinquished the vision of cultural affirmation though in practice achieving it was easier said than done. I think most of the staff would agree that, at our best, we were a well-functioning bicultural, bilingual program, where cross-cultural conflicts were often handled skillfully. In the 23 years of its existence, the Westborough Deaf Unit provided psychiatric care for around 200 deaf people, many of whom were hospitalized numerous times. We learned a number of important lessons about the problems of deaf psychiatric clients, about how to adapt assessment and treatment for them, and about the creation of culturally affirmative and clinically competent treatment environments. This chapter presents my summary of these lessons. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

The present study extends this literature by testing M. J. Miller and R. H.

W. Berry, 2003) across behavioral and values domains—in 3 independent cluster analyses with Asian American participants. Present findings supported the domain-specific acculturation strategy hypothesis as 67% to 72% of participants from 3 independent samples using different strategies across behavioral and values domains. Consistent with theory, a number of acculturation strategy cluster group differences emerged across generational status, acculturative stress, mental health symptoms, and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help.

Abstract = {Family life is vital to most Latinos. Family resilience thus is an important perspective for family scholars working with Latino families to adopt because of its focus on wellness and adaptability, in effect, punctuating the strengths common among Latino families. Toward the latter part of the twentieth century, conversations among family scientists and family therapists more and more included the concept of resilience. Researchers began examining family dynamics that provided a more accurate portrayal of family life, as well as in terms of providing professional support to families. Although we are primarily focusing on family resilience as the focus of analysis, we also discuss how cultural values, beliefs, attitudes, and practices can be integrated into a resilience framework for Latino families. For example, evidence shows that being bicultural and maintaining original cultural values contribute to positive mental health. Our discussion springs from Hawley and DeHaan's assertion that if we emphasize resilience in clients, then we will focus on strengths. Within this primary assertion, one assumes that if families possess qualities that enable them to withstand seemingly insurmountable barriers, then we should focus on the observable cultural norms and behaviors that contribute lo Latino families' well-being. In this chapter, we thus pull together several threads that form a tapestry displaying familias fuertes (strong families). Building upon Walsh's model of family resilience, Hawley and DeHann's work integrating lifespan and family perspectives, and a review of the literature of family resilience among immigrant Latinos, our chapter provides a preliminary framework for understanding and supporting Latino families in therapy. Our goal in positing this emerging clinical framework is to account for various dimensions of family strengths among Latino families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Theory building and research on resilient family systems has evolved over lime, beginning with family stress theory focused on factors that protected the family system from entering into a crisis. With the addition of the postcrisis recovery processes of adjustment and adaptation, the foundation of family resilience theory was established. With the rapid development of psychological theories and research on resilient children and adults, family scholars drew from these theories and research methods to advance their own body of work on ethnic family systems and their resilience. Research on ethnic family systems followed along the psychology-guided pathway with the inclusion of dimensions of ethnicity as categorical variables inserted in the equation to explain variability in the chosen indices of resilience. Consequently, the in-depth study of ethnicity in family systems and the advancement of a systems theory of resilience have been limited. The study of resilience in ethnic minority family systems continued to evolve as reflected in a three volume Sage book series. While affirming the value of understanding ethnic family systems, these studies also revealed the limitations of the then current theories and research methodologies when applied to ethnic family systems. At one end of the spectrum of limitations was the dependence upon stereotypes to give meaning to the conceptualization, as well as the design, data collection, and interpretation of findings. At the other extreme were a dependence on Western and white middle class measures and a conspicuous absence of metrics grounded in the ethnic and cultural dynamics and processes of the populations being studied. In the middle of this continuum of weaknesses was the absence of constructs that reveal the dynamics of the ethnic family as a system embedded in a social and ecological context. Ethnic families in the US are, at a minimum, bicultural with indigenous ethnic and ancestral origins engaged (by forced immigration, migration and/or colonization) in survival and adaptation in a context that has its own schema of norms, expectations, beliefs, values, and traditions. It is our intention in this chapter to address these and other conundrums by introducing a Relational and Resilience Theory of Ethnic Family Systems.

Abstract = {This article endeavors to investigate the role of social networks in contributing to the quality of life of an elder and middle-aged Deaf population. In particular, it poses the question of whether a certain network composition (deaf and hearing network persons) provides positive resources to improve quality of life and attempts to identify moderating and mediating connections between social networks and quality of life. Based on the data collected in a survey of 107 members of the Deaf community aged 45–81 years, it was possible to ascertain the fact that a larger social network is significantly associated with a higher quality of life, but the size of the deaf network is principally decisive. The hypothesis that a bicultural network composition would have a particular positive effect on the quality of life could not be confirmed. Findings revealed that the effect of deaf network size on the quality of life is mediated by personal resources concerning self-efficacy and communication skills. Moreover, evidence was sound for the functional equivalence of social and personal resources, which suggests that potential negative effects of reduced personal resources on the quality of life could possibly be compensated by a larger deaf network and vice versa.

Abstract = {Study 1 established a valid Spanish version of the Daily Stress Inventory (DSI) among 62 bilingual Hispanic volunteers (aged 18–80 yrs). Study 2 used the bilingual version of the DSI to assess differences in the level of stress experienced by 235 Hispanic volunteers (aged 18–82 yrs) from 3 selected Hispanic groups: very Hispanic/Hispanic-oriented bicultural, "true" bicultural, and Anglo-oriented bicultural/very Anglicized. Groups were determined by the adapted version of the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans. Bilingual DSI scores were highly correlated with the scores of the original DSI when both instruments were responded to simultaneously by fully bilingual individuals. Ss at different acculturation levels had different scores on impact/event scales when a median-split method of analysis was employed, suggesting that acculturation level may be related to stress level.

The voices represented are those of two Hungarian immigrant professionals and their families. The families found media technology beneficial in all three areas explored: the development and maintenance of HL, relationships with relatives, and heritage culture. Adult family members also repeatedly pointed out the significance of their own active involvement in the process, and their responsibility in selecting appropriate resources and in being available to support children in their optimal use of media technology.

Abstract = {A high prevalence of risk behaviors among the rapidly growing Latino youth population in the United States adds urgency to the need to identify effective recruitment and retention strategies for research studies and prevention programs. The objectives of this study are to (a) describe the culturally responsive recruitment and retention strategies used in the Familias Fuertes–Georgia program and (b) discuss the evaluation of the relative importance of these strategies. Familias Fuertes (i.e., Strong Families) is a community-based, primary prevention program for families in Latin America with children between the ages of 10 and 14 years. The main program goal is to reduce high-risk behaviors among adolescents by strengthening family relationships and promoting self-regulation and positive conflict resolution strategies. A pilot feasibility study was conducted to determine the appropriateness of the Familias Fuertes program for Latino families living in the United States. To promote participation, 15 culturally responsive recruitment and retention strategies were developed using a three-step process. These strategies contributed to the successful recruitment and retention of Familias Fuertes–Georgia study participants. Participating parents, the community liaison, and the community leader evaluated the relative importance of the 15 culturally responsive recruitment and retention strategies. Three of the strategies emerged as more important than others: face-to-face recruitment by the community liaison; bilingual, bicultural, and experienced facilitators; and free on-site child care. Further research is needed to develop strategies promoting the participation of male caregivers/fathers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The book is organized around three expansive themes that strongly draw on its focus on educational change: (1) educational practices and identities, (2) literacy, youth cultures and virtual spaces, and (3) educational policies and professional identities. Despite its limitations in terms of organization, the book provides an extremely valuable contribution to the field of language and education. The book, in its attempt to address contexts of educational change, demonstrates that 'spaces for "agentive" action are as open and "available" as they have ever been'. This volume is strongly recommended to anyone with an interest in current educational issues in the United States and Mexico—and beyond, as the challenges facing the educational communities presented in these chapters could easily be extended to other communities elsewhere.

Abstract = {The psychopathology of migrants is usually related to either an original etiopathology, or to traumatic conditions of the migration or to adaptation constraints to the host country. Many researches observed a higher rate of admission in psychiatric hospitals for immigrants, but few were interested in differentiating mental health and illness by comparing a group of healthy individuals with ill ones in a population of migrants. The assumption of this research is that the trajectory, an intercultural variable defined as the spatial and temporal way they integrate migration into family choices, is a linked-factor to etiopathogeny in migration. Within the framework of a study on risk and linked factors related to mental illness (140 variables) this hypothesis was tested on male North Africans migrants (N = 150) in Southern France, by a questionary elaborated and applied according to a culture contact psychology methodology. The results given by the factor analysis tended to distribute the variables along two main factorial axes: mono-cultural (host country culture vs. country of origin culture) and intercultural (insertion vs. integration), revealing the presence of four groups (over-adapted, marginalized, inserted and integrated). They are characterized by the way they integrate migration into family choices which appeared directly linked to mental morbidity. The results show that it is not the migration by itself which constitutes a trauma but rather its integration into the family plan which either ensures stability or leads to an upset in the family balance jeopardizing mental health by the double pathogenic effect of marital and acculturative stresses. Moreover it appears that the etiopathogenic weight of the contradiction between the cultural norms depends on the culture considered to be the reference by the migrant. The de facto bicultural choice (strong adhesion to host country values in spite of the country of origin in the over-adapted group) is a mental health factor. At the opposite the frustrated bicultural choice (very weak adhesion to host country values, as by necessity the country of origin remains the reference in the marginalized group) appears as a risk factor. The choices of intercultural compromises within the family structure (that I will coin as interculturation) lead to a real betterment for mental health (integrated group). These results change the evaluation of the pathogenic effects of migration which were generally interpreted through either the direct attribution of an etiopathogenic function to migration or by emphasizing an imported psychopathology. Psychopathological illnesses of immigrants turned out to be correlated with the trajectory, a variable defined as the spatial and temporal way they integrate migration into family choices, determining factors in mental health. Thus the trajectory seems to be the non-dyscrasia vs. dyscrasia answer given by immigrants to the break in the symbolic ascendancy imposed by migration.

Abstract = {This study explored the within-person dynamic organization of emotion in East-Asian Canadian bicultural individuals as they function in two cultural worlds. Using a diary design, we examined under what conditions their emotional structure resembles that of Westerners or that of East Asians. As predicted, when these bicultural individuals identified with a Western culture or had recently spoken a non-Asian language, their positive and negative affect were inversely associated. When they identified with an Asian culture or interacted in an Asian language, this inverse association disappeared. This study shows that as bicultural individuals identify and communicate with members of one or the other cultural group, they may adopt a culturally congruent phenomenology, including a distinct affective pattern.

Abstract = {Literatures on ethnic identity and acculturation have supported orthogonal conceptualization and separate measurements of ethnic identity and identification with the majority group or the larger society. The author further argues to conceptually differentiate identification with the majority group and identification with the larger society. A study with Asian American students (n = 91) and African American students (n = 115) in a large US Midwestern public university revealed no correlation between ethnic identity and identification with White Americans for Asian Americans and a small negative correlation at marginal significance for African Americans. These results support the orthogonal model. While identification with White Americans positively predicted national identity in regression analyses for both samples, ethnic identity also added a unique positive main effect, and additionally through an interaction effect suppressed the strength of identification with White Americans, for predicting national identity among American-born Asian Americans. Bicultural identity integrating ethnicity and nationality was suggested as the identity mechanism explaining this result. Thus, identification with the majority group and national identity were empirically shown to be different concepts, and ethnic identity can contribute to national identity. Suggestions for future research include regional comparative studies and deeper analysis of bicultural integration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The confluence of Chinese and Western cultures in Hong Kong since the signing of the Treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) in 1842 has been long enough for biculturalism to mature, not fully but strong enough to add to Hong Kong's uniqueness and vibrancy. Here I first provide a psycho-social analysis of two different forms of biculturalism that vary from lower to higher degrees of bicultural integration. Second I develop a model of bicultural selves for understanding bicultural individuals in terms of their Chinese and Western selves. Finally I apply this model to address the question of how the parallel processes of decolonialization from Hong Kong's past and its future psychological reunification with Mainland China may produce a new biculturalism.

Special attention is drawn to the theoretical and methodological advances made by applications of the dynamic constructivist approach to the study of the behaviours of bicultural individuals experimentally. Reviewed evidence alludes to the possibility of two forms of biculturalism that develop in different contexts: Chinese becoming bicultural as a result of emigration vs. Chinese becoming bicultural in their homeland as a result of exposure to foreign cultures brought about by globalization or westernization. Recent findings concerning the specific form that biculturalism may take in Hong Kong Chinese after the reunification with China are also discussed. It is concluded that further research throwing light on the potentially unique factors that determine bicultural integration in Chinese societies is warranted.

Subjective cultural variables collectively accounted for 2% to 28% of the variance in communication preferences. In addition, several associations were discovered: (a) having an interdependent self-construal was associated positively with preferences for significant other as a source, family sources, fear messages, media channels, and face-to-face channels; (b) having a bicultural identity was associated positively with preferences for family sources and media channels, but negatively with a desire for no information; and (c) having a marginal identity and equity attributions were associated positively with preferences for fear messages and a desire for no information, but negatively with preferences for expert sources.

Abstract = {Much of the past research in marketing communications has focused on one language or on monolinguals and how they process information (Usunier, 1996), generally ignoring the language of the communication. Hence, consumer research has not fully explored the impact that different languages can have on message perception. The goal of this chapter is to further understand how language choices and multilanguage situations impact the process and the social perception of a message. Although consumer research in this area is still in its infancy, three main areas of research have emerged. The three streams of research are unique language processing, bilingual cognitive processing, and bilingual-bicultural processing. As language and communication does not take place in a vacuum, overlap between these research streams does exist. The present research examines some of the factors that determine the way in which people process and interpret messages and suggests future research directions.

Abstract = {In this chapter we are concerned with the ways an ideology of reconciliation is materialized in an exhibition space at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington. One of the fundamental objectives of this museum is to "represent the bicultural nature of the country, recognizing the mana and significance of each of the two mainstreams of tradition and cultural heritage, and provide the means for each to contribute effectively to a statement of the nation's identity..." (Museum's Mission as cited in Bossley, 1998, p. 2). Biculturalism, the concept of partnership between Maori and Pakeha (non-Maori), has its roots in the controversial founding constitutional document of New Zealand, The Treaty of Waitangi. Inside the museum, the 'physical' interfacing of Maori and Pakeha takes place in the Signs of a Nation: Nga Tohu Kotahitanga exhibition. This exhibition is subdivided into three main spaces. The first two deal with the fundamental ideas of the Treaty of Waitangi: government, citizens' rights, and conceptions of land. The third is the Poringi exhibition, which presents both the Maori and Pakeha sides of a land rights case that is currently before the Waitangi Tribunal. The aim of this chapter is to investigate some of the ways difference, struggle, and coexistence are enacted across ideational, interpersonal, and textual meanings in three-dimensional space.

Abstract = {This handbook applies proven techniques, derived from bilingual/bicultural classrooms, to teaching literacy in the twenty-first century. Its goal is to help teachers increase their understanding of bilingual learners in order to maximize instruction. Teachers can use this handbook to expand their understanding of literacy and bilingualism: implement literacy approaches; assess students' development; and learn through reflection. Complete and straightforward instructions, illustrated by case studies, allow teachers to use the strategies in this handbook on their own or in teacher-led study groups. They can select from the variety of approaches the ones which best match their students' needs and their own teaching style. All of the approaches share characteristics that help motivate students of varying language abilities to develop literacy. The approaches have been modified and tested with bilingual students of different ages and language backgrounds in bilingual, ESL, mainstream, special education, and deaf education classes ranging from preschool through high school. New in the Second Edition: Five new approaches with their corresponding classroom implementation; Additional information in each introduction addressing its theme; New material on issues of language, culture, and literacy development of students completely new to the English language; and Annotated bibliographies with sample books to support literacy within language and content area classes. This book is intended for a broad audience of teachers in any type of classroom where bilingualism plays a role, and is an excellent text for preservice and inservice courses that prepare teachers to work with English language learners.

The latter are often unaware of deeply embedded cultural assumptions of individualism in their psyches and in psychoanalytic and psychological theories and norms. This can result in psychopathologizing Asian North Americans or seeing them as inferior. The most difficult part of doing psychoanalytic therapy with them is first learning a different normality/psychopathology continuum from Euro-North Americans, and then ascertaining where a patient's psychopathology is on this different continuum. The nature of the therapy relationship is related to three psychosocial dimensions of Asian hierarchical relationships. Anger, communication, the bicultural self, the magic-cosmic and spiritual self, and trauma and immigration are then delved into. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Although ethnic identity development is primarily the result of racial socialization practices, it may also be influenced by other contextual factors.

Exploratory factor analysis and path analysis were used to explore the influence of certain contextual factors on the ethnic identity content of study participants. The findings suggest that urban hassles negatively affect the content of ethnic identity but that this effect may be mediated by racial socialization.

Abstract = {The ways in which immigrant health profiles change with shifts in acculturation is of increasing interest to scholars and policy makers in the United States, but little is known about the mechanisms that may link acculturation and self-rated health, particularly for Asians. Utilizing the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) and its data on foreign-born Latinos (N = 1,199) and Asians (N = 1,323) (Pennell et al. 2004), we investigate and compare the associations between acculturation and self-rated health for immigrants to the United States from six major ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican). Using comprehensive measures of acculturation, we demonstrate that across ethnic groups, and despite the widely varying contexts of the sending countries and receiving communities, native-language dominance is associated with worse self-rated health relative to bilingualism, and measures of lower acculturation—coethnic ties and remittances—are associated with better self-rated health; and moreover, these associations are only partially mediated by socioeconomic status, and not mediated by acculturative stress, discrimination, social support, or health behaviors. We speculate that immigrants who maintain a native language while also acquiring English, as has been shown for other immigrant outcomes, attain a bicultural fluency, which also enables good health. Surprisingly, we do not find strong associations between duration of time in the United States or age at migration—measures frequently used to proxy acculturation—with self-rated health. Our findings illustrate the complexity of measuring acculturation and its influence on health for immigrants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Previously, scholars have implied that leadership theory is “universal” enough and can be applied systematically regardless of cultural influences in subcultures. Leadership research has limited its scope of discernment to dominant society, implying that nonmainstream individuals will acquiesce and that cultural differences are inconsequential. Therefore, the intention of this study was to address the disparity between current leadership theories and a subgroup perspective. Specifically, this study explored leadership from a Lakota Sioux perspective. In this qualitative grounded theory study, six major and five minor themes surfaced: Traditional Values and Behaviors, Putting Others First, Lakota Leadership Qualities (Men, Women, and Fallen Leaders), The Red Road, Nation Building (“Real” Natives and Bicultural), and Barriers. These findings reveal that Lakota leadership is not elucidated by current theory. Thus, to effectively illustrate leadership, researchers should broaden contextual aspects to include subcultures.

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of a culturally grounded, community-based diabetes prevention program among obese Latino adolescents. Methods: Fifteen obese Latino adolescents (body mass index [BMI] percentile = 96.3 ± 1.1, age = 15.0 ± 0.9 years) completed a 12-week intervention that included weekly lifestyle education classes delivered by bilingual/bicultural promotoras and three, 60-minute physical activity sessions per week. Participants were assessed for anthropometrics (height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference), cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity/inactivity, nutrition behaviors, and insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance by a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Results: The intervention resulted in significant decreases in BMI z score, BMI percentile, and waist circumference; increases in cardiorespiratory fitness; and decreases in physical inactivity and dietary fat consumption. In addition to these changes, the intervention led to significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and reductions in 2-hour glucose levels. Conclusions: These results support the feasibility and efficacy of a community-based diabetes prevention program for high-risk Latino youth.

The purpose of this study was: (1) to offer culturally-grounded recommendations towards the development of effective Teen Dating Violence (TDV) programs and/or the modification of existing programs, and (2) to identify potential barriers to Mexican American youth’s participation in TDV programs. Using the perspectives of Mexican American youth (15 to 17 years old) and a phenomenological study design, focus groups (N = 14) were conducted that were homogeneous by gender and level of acculturation (low/bicultural/high). Youth provided recommendations for program design (i.e. Design it to explore between-group and within-group cultural variability, Design it to be broad in scope, and Keep it positive) and program implementation (i.e. Make the program fun and non-threatening, and Involve peers, couples, and individuals) within the context of acculturation. Adolescents’ suggestion of a program delivered in smaller groups that support sharing within peer relationships may stem from a desire for intimacy within close relationships—re-creating a sense of familismo. Teen dating violence programs best meets the needs of Mexican American adolescents by including programmatic components that are grounded in personalized cultural values.

Abstract = {This study explores the referral experience of physicians who refer Latinos to end-of-life care and challenges associated with the referral process. Qualitative data were collected in New Jersey through semistructured, open-ended interviews. Six physicians participated in this study: 1 oncologist, 2 internists, 1 gerontologist, and 2 infectious disease specialists. The study reveals that language barriers, level of family involvement, and generational group of the patient and the family contribute to the complexity of the physician’s experience. Physicians’ comments evidence the importance of culturally competent training in medical school and continued education on this topic for physicians who did not receive such training. Bilingual bicultural hospice admissions’ staff available at the physician’s office could enhance the referral experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Three conceptualizations of psychosocial development were investigated among Canadian First Nation adolescents. Loevinger’s social cognitive model of ego development reflects the way in which an individual views the self and social reality. From Eriksonian theory, ego strengths refer to the emergent values or outcomes that represent resolution of the eight psychosocial stages of development, and ethnic identity is a domain of personal identity with special relevance for minorities. As expected, age and biological gender differences were found for ego development. Associations between ego development and ego strengths were supported as were age differences in ethnic identity status. Traditional students (strongly identified with indigenous culture) demonstrated greater ego strengths than bicultural (identified with both their own and mainstream cultures) adolescents.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Creating Infrastructures for Latino Mental Health edited by Lydia P. Buki and Lissette M. Piedra (see record [rid]2012-16323-000[/rid]). The reviewers describe this as a timely book that sheds light on the need for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers to think creatively on how to meet the mental health needs of a growing Latino population. As noted in the Preface, the overarching theme of the book is that in order to establish the basic organizational structures and facilities required to meet the needs of Latino mental health, there should be a radical change in the status quo. As noted throughout the text, there is a dire need for ample facilities, resources, and bilingual and bicultural personnel, yet there are not enough culturally competent and bilingual professionals available to meet this need. The reviewers believe this book takes a step in the right direction by bringing together scholars from multiple disciplines to tackle this issue. The reviewers conclude that, overall, this book provides a valuable contribution to the Latino mental health field. Although the book tends to focus on a specific segment of Latinos (i.e., immigrant, Spanish speaking) and could have included other segments (e.g., U.S.-born, third generation and beyond, middle class), it is a good first step. In the reviewers' opinion, the book does a good job in providing an overview of infrastructure needs as well as recommendations for how to address these needs, and the editors have done an excellent job in bringing together a diverse group of authors to tackle the challenge of providing the readers guidance on how to address the gap in Latino mental health services.

Abstract = {Reply to comments made by Christine T. Chambers on the current authors' original article EVENDOL, a new behavioral pain scale for children ages 0 to 7 years in the emergency department: Design and validation (2012). EVENDOL, a new behavioral pain scale, was developed to measure pain among young children from birth to 7 years across a range of situations from acute pain to entrenched pain in medical, surgical, and post-trauma settings. The aim of the authors was not only to provide information on French research on pain assessment in young children, including the psychometric validation criteria used for the instrument, it was also to make more widely available an instrument that appears relevant and useful in day-to-day practice. The long, thorough translation procedure used only bilingual and bicultural caregivers, most of whom were working in the area of pain among children. EVENDOL nevertheless proved fairly easy to translate, because it is a clinical measure intended for use by health care professionals, so that aspects of wording acceptability and comprehensibility that are crucial in subjective questionnaires are less so here. The authors contended that what underpins the validity of a translated measure is the quality of the translation and the transcultural stability of the concept measured.

Design: A cross-sectional survey with 297 adult Arab Americans used (a) a demographic and health survey, SF-36 Version-1, to assess physical and mental health and (b) the Acculturation Rating Scale for Arab Americans-II to assess acculturation. Findings: Participants reported significantly better physical health and worse mental health compared to the published norm for the 1998 U.S. population. Better physical health was associated with demographic factors and bicultural identification; better mental health was associated with attraction to American culture. Attraction to American culture predicted alcohol use, whereas attraction to Arabic culture predicted cigarette smoking. Conclusion: Different patterns of association existed between acculturation and physical and mental health among Arab Americans. Implications for Practice: Findings suggest that acculturation is an important factor to consider in the well-being of Arab Americans, especially in their mental health.

The purpose of this research is to describe the meaning and experience of cultural safety as depicted by nurses in New Zealand and to illustrate the potential for this to inform U.S. nursing education and practice. This interpretive hermeneutic study explored cultural safety as described by 12 experienced nurses who were selected through snowball and purposive sampling. Audiotaped interviews were conducted after ethics approval. Interpretive analysis uncovered five themes that are described with data and paradigm cases. Cultural safety considers the perspective of the patient as the norm in contrast to the culture of health care. Understanding historical power differences and personal biases can help challenge victim-blaming responses by health care providers. Incorporating these understandings into reflective practice enhances the possibility of culturally safe learning for students and culturally safe care for patients.

The present study examines the nature of public conversations about ethnicity and adoption of 41 elementary school age girls adopted from China and the ecological factors related to less frequent occurrences of such conversations and to the positive nature of these experiences. Results indicate that family structure (single parent vs. two parents) and parental bicultural competence predict membership in the favorable condition (reporting fewer public interaction experiences and reporting more positive experiences, respectively).

Through in-depth personal interviews with 35 second generation youth from diverse cultures, the authors explored: (1) parental influences and expectations of their children’s mate choices; (2) the roles of gender, birth order, and length of residency in the United States in expectations for mate selection; and (3) immigrant youth’s preferences for marriage partners. The findings showed that immigrant parents hold mostly endogamous views. Youth’s dating experiences are influenced by their gender, their birth order, and their family’s acculturation. Second generation immigrants generally seek bicultural partners like themselves. Narratives from the participants provide insight into the attitudes that guide mate selection of these young adults from immigrant families.

Assessment of pain within a bicultural environment has the potential to cause ineffective pain management and unnecessary suffering amongst Indigenous people. It has been recognised that non-Indigenous nurses sometimes demonstrate culturally unsafe practices during the pain assessment process. These practices have arisen due to limited knowledge of what constitutes 'cultural safety' and how nurses can apply this concept during pain assessment.

Abstract = {This article discusses a study that examined cultural frame switching among bicultural Greek participants living in the Netherlands. The research demonstrated that self-evaluations, self-stereotypes, and attitudes toward family integrity and friendship were affected by cultural framing. Experimentally primed bicultural participants and monocultural comparison groups in the Netherlands and Greece were used. Activating Greek culture especially, in comparison to activating Dutch culture, led to a less positive evaluation of the personal self, stronger Greek self-stereotyping, and stronger endorsement of family integrity and friendship. Similar differences were found when comparing monocultural Dutch and monocultural Greek participants. In addition, cultural priming affected group identification, which was found to be associated with perceptions and attitudes. The pattern of results suggests that group identification, in part, mediates the relationship between cultural framing and perceptual and evaluative responses. It is concluded that social identity principles are important for understanding the experiences of bicultural individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Findings support the orthogonality of bicultural identifications and good validity and reliability for the KACIA.

By surveying county-level ethnic program specialists in the decentralized California state system, the study identified strategies considered effective for reaching African American, Asian American, Latino, and Native Americans communities and overcoming barriers to treatment-seeking. In multivariate analysis, strategies were linked to ethnic-specific Medi-Cal penetration rates calculated as measures of access. Results indicated that undertaking outreach activities was associated with greater access for Latinos and Native Americans. For Asian Americans, hiring bilingual or bicultural staff was associated with greater access but having a bilingual or bicultural receptionist was associated with lesser access. For all minority groups as well as for Whites, the overall supply of mental health practitioners in the county was strongly associated with greater access. The study documented real-world efforts to improve minority access and, despite limitations imposed by its cross-sectional design, provided preliminary evidence of effectiveness.

Abstract = {The goals of this chapter are to examine the exploration of ethnic and racial identity issues beyond adolescence among minority group members. There is wide variation in the extent of ethnic identity exploration during the transition to adulthood, depending on aspects of both the individual and the context. This chapter focuses on ethnic identity exploration in the American context and specifically on ethnic and racial minorities within that context. I consider individual processes and characteristics that influence ethnic identity exploration and the contextual factors that shape the course of such exploration during emerging adulthood. For convenience, I use the term ethnic identity to encompass three aspects of group identity processes: ethnic heritage, racial phenotype, and cultural background. Although these three aspects of group identity can be distinguished conceptually and have different implications for the individual (Alipuria, 2002), they often overlap as individuals strive to construct a coherent sense of self as group members. However, I use separate terms when discussing research that explicitly focuses on one or another aspect. I begin with a summary of the development of ethnic identity before and during adolescence and then examine this process following adolescence in a variety of contexts and for individuals with a range of group identity challenges, such as being bicultural or being biracial.

The goals of this chapter are to first highlight some of the social and linguistic practices that have been observed in deaf parent/deaf child and hearing parent/deaf child family contexts. Our review is influenced by a sociocultural theoretical framework in which engagement and guided participation support a child's development of language and identity. Second, we review what is known about classroom interactions in early childhood and elementary school contexts. Third, we discuss some practical considerations with respect to teachers emulating deaf caregiver--deaf child practices and consider some of the obstacles that may challenge this potential approach. Finally, taking together all of the research findings reviewed on caregiver--infant and teacher--student interaction, we end with a discussion in which we propose a new conceptualization of an educator of the deaf whose primary focus would be to guide and promote, through everyday practice, the bilingual and bicultural identity development of deaf children using communication strategies modeled upon effective family engagement.

Abstract = {Italians have immigrated to Chicago since about 1850. The greatest numbers came between 1880 and 1914, with additional peaks in the 1920s and in the period from 1946 to the 1980s, when Italian immigration ended. The Collandia Ladies' Club was founded in Chicago in the 1950s as an auxiliary to the Collandia Men's Club, started in the 1930s by immigrants from Lucca. It consists of American-born Italian women and Italian-born post-World War II immigrant women. Entitled to membership because they have husbands in the Men's Club, these women have as their purpose "to help the men." The Collandia Club is recreational, its heart simple. Lifetime friendships are formed and fostered here where members come to play cards, to place bocce, and to speak Italian. Everyone knows about everyone else's troubles and pleasures. People get married, raise children, and grow old together. In some ways the Collandia represents the caffe and the piazza of the paese left behind. At the Collandia, I engaged in 2 and a half years of long-term participant observation (Hymes, 1974) to reach an emic interpretation of the culture. I came to realize the importance of being not just bilingual, but also bicultural. That is, I came to understand the extent to which language and culture are inextricably bound at the Collandia Club. Despite 30 to 40 years of living in Chicago, a familiarity with English, and incorporation of American holidays, the underlying mores of this club are Italian. Of these underlying mores, the most important phenomenon is the Italian cultural construction known as fare bella figura, literally "to make a beautiful figure." Figuratively, the phrase means "to engage in appropriate visual display, to look good, to show off, to put on the dog"--in short, "to perform." At the Collandia Club, a bella figura performance is always expected, encouraged, and constituted. Analysis of a partial transcript of a Collandia Ladies' Club financial meeting shows that within this bilingual, bicultural community, the concept of bellafigura is transferred into speech in English, too. That is, whether speaking Italian or English, one must/are bella figura. This analysis answers the following questions: What is the social context of this interaction? That is, how do these women "present" themselves? How are they members of the same speech community? What are the communicative strategies at work here? How do the women create "conversational involvement"? Where does "performance" occur? How is this an example of a communally constituted performance? What role does indirection and the view of women as "powerless" users of language play in this discourse? The overarching question of this analysis remains: How are language and culture inextricably bound? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (create)},

Abstract = {Developing health messages for bicultural audiences can present challenges because of potentially competing views about an issue that might be tied to each culture. To help illuminate what such beliefs might be with respect to smoking, a qualitative study was conducted with Mexican American adolescents in two U.S.-Mexico border communities. Adapting a consumer-behavior research method, we asked participants to construct collages representing their views of Mexican and American cultures as well as the overlap between the cultures. Participants then sorted concepts related to identity and tobacco within the cultural domains. Findings involved shifting cultural identities and the association of both tobacco promotion and prevention with American culture. Results also suggest that “making it” in America while remaining true to Mexican heritage is viewed as a much-admired outcome. It is suggested that framing health behaviors as consistent with this aspirational image is a promising health-promotion approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This article used life histories to intensely document the experiences of four senior-level African American male faculty members who worked in predominately White institutions of higher education located in the northeast. Data for this study was collected through a total of twelve in-depth interviews. The research revealed that whereas each of the respondents had experiences with being acculturated to predominately White educational settings, each scholar brought his own unique perspective to the acculturation process. The men revealed that there were definitely moments throughout their acculturation process in predominately White educational settings where they felt they were toggling between two cultures; and they indicated that at times this was problematic in their attempts to acculturate to those environments. The men did not indicate that they believed that there was a need for them to acquire a bicultural identity as a means of being successful in their acculturation efforts in predominately White college settings. Overall the men indicated that they were satisfied with their choices to pursue careers as faculty members in the academy and the men believed that they were meritorious in acculturating to its environments.

Abstract = {In this chapter, I reflect critically on how my experiences in U. S. higher education, both as a graduate student and junior faculty, were marked by a strong cultural tension. Stimulated by the interplay of multiple forces, this tension emerged from two important aspirations of mine: a firm desire to develop as a scholar in the United States and a personal effort to sustain my fluid identities as a mestizo, bilingual and bicultural, first-generation immigrant woman from Guatemala. Through the use of a personal narrative, I portray my efforts to develop an authentic, culturally-rooted academic identity in two distinct disciplines: modern dance and education. I focus on the aspect of "scholarly writing" because it represents the domain in which cultural tensions were most evident and excruciating for me. The narrative illustrates how scholarly writing was both a challenge and an opportunity for developing a Latina transnational immigrant identity and an authorial voice to overcome cultural racism and academic isolation in the United States. Special attention is given to the counter-spaces I co-created with mentors, colleagues, and students for promoting culturally-sensitive approaches to teaching, service, and scholarship. I conclude the chapter with some recommendations for Latinas and fellow women of color who seek to develop a culturally-rooted authorial voice in U. S. higher education.

Abstract = {This grounded theory study utilized art therapy techniques to explore the experiences of 8 Latino families that had immigrated to the United States. Focus group facilitators invited the parents and adolescent children in the families to share their acculturation experiences verbally and in family drawings. Emergent themes from each of three focus groups were categorized and used to interpret the participants' drawings, creating consistencies between the sources of data. The results suggested that the fathers struggled with unexpressed anxieties and stressors, the mothers were concerned with holding the family together with traditional values that they feared losing, and the adolescents demonstrated strengths as bilingual, bicultural agents of acculturation for the entire family system. Art therapy can facilitate communication about the complex nature of acculturation and can be incorporated into research methods for understanding family drawings.

Abstract = {It is impossible to know the full extent of Navajo social wellbeing prior to European contact. Today there are challenges with referring to tribal-specific statistics because they tend to be rare. However, there is evidence that wellbeing presents a complicated picture. For example, a negative indicator, diabetes has increased among Navajos. "Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, only six decades ago a rare phenomenon among the Navajo Indians, has become increasingly common in this population". Yet, this decline in wellbeing is attributed to nutritional changes that occurred as a result of shifting from more wholesome indigenous fare to commodity foods (white flour, shortening and salt) that are low in nutritional value and high in caloric value. The increase in diabetes is also thought to be due to increases in Navajo life expectancy; as a population ages, increases in chronic health conditions likewise occur. Navajo longevity has been on the rise, particularly since the 1960s, and the population had demonstrated significant growth since its low point in 1680. In the centuries since first contact with Europeans, mainstream American culture has impacted the Navajo way of life and society. Even so, a distinctive Navajo culture persists and thrives. Happiness among Navajos is quite varied. To those Navajos fully assimilated into mainstream American culture, their happiness will be more like mainstream notions of happiness, probably more hedonistic, material-and religion-based. However, to those Navajos more culturally attached to the traditional Navajo Ways, their happiness will more likely hinge on the lived practice and philosophy of walking in happiness or walking in beauty (Hózhó Násháádóó or Nízhónígóó Násháádóó). In between these are those Navajos more bicultural or multicultural, who combine mainstream conceptions of happiness with traditional Navajo ways. This chapter focuses on the salient conceptions of happiness anchored in more traditional Navajo culture. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {The 2002 Code of Ethics for Psychologists Working in Aotearoa/New Zealand marked a major departure from its predecessor and from codes of other jurisdictions. Following the lead of the Canadian Psychological Association, an aspirational model was adopted in which guidance for ethical decision making is directly related to broad principles and related values. The code explicitly admitted the views of Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. As a consequence it reflects a bicultural perspective, including a shift away from an individualized conception of people and their behavior to a stronger acknowledgement of the role of community and culture in people's lives. The social and political influences on the development of this code are described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {The underachievement of African American, Latino, and American Indian students in the United States has been partially attributed to poor engagement in school (e.g., Connell, Spencer & Aber, 1994; Steele, 1997). In this chapter, we consider the role of ethnicity in student engagement. A number of factors have been posited to influence minority students' engagement in school. Okagaki (2001) conceptualized these factors into three broad domains: the roles of the student, the family, and the school. We begin with a discussion of factors within the student, such as students' ethnic identity beliefs, experiences with discrimination, and bicultural efficacy, and the relations of these factors to students' engagement in school. In the second section, we examine the role that parents' beliefs, expectations, and behaviors play in ethnic minority students' engagement in school, paying particular attention to beliefs and values that can be attributed to parents' cultural models of education (Gallimore & Goldenberg, 2001; Lareau, 1996). Third, we consider how factors associated with teachers, peers, and friends relate to ethnic minority students' engagement in school. In particular, we focus on students' access to same ethnic teachers and peers, the quality of relationships with teachers and friends, and pedagogical practices that may facilitate ethnic minority students' engagement in school. Finally, we identify the need for stronger empirical research around the identification and amelioration of the discontinuities between home and school cultures.

Next, issues related to counseling individuals with disabilities are discussed. In particular, disability-affirmative therapy is described, along with a template for key questions to explore with clients. Special issues in training and supervision are discussed from two perspectives: when the client or when the therapist is the person with a disability.

Abstract = {Ward and Liu present the historical origins of interethnic relations in New Zealand between the Maori and Pakeha and the development of bicultural relations. Further discussion delineates the immigration of several different ethnic groups into New Zealand over the past century, creating a more complex demographic. Existent ideals of the general population reveal signs of tolerance and harmony between ethnic groups. Improvements for the future that will provide the greatest benefit for all New Zealanders are suggested. Description of colonization reveals initial conflicts over land which was originally guaranteed to remain with the original owners. Recognition of Maori displacement and forced assimilation into cities reveals an early loss of indigenous culture. Protest movements are presented as engendering revival of culture and revision of the initial treaty to include tribal self-management, equality for all, cooperation, and redress. Historical review of the government responses to arrivals of various immigrant groups demonstrates discrimination and European preference. Ward and Liu explain that while these policies have changed, discrimination is still present in many areas. The authors express the view that relative deprivation and relative advantage have increased negative attitudes between groups. Discussion of recent research reveals the prevalence of multicultural ideology in New Zealand today and factors associated with positive attitudes are described. Research is also cited which reflects a preference for integration, but unwillingness to accommodate other cultural practices. In exploring means to improve ethnic relations, the authors identify the blending of biculturalism and multiculturalism as necessary given the special circumstances in New Zealand. Recent government initiatives are noted to have provided services to help equalize immigrants, particularly the recently proposed Multi-cultural cultural Act which provides recognition of Maori status, cultural maintenance, and participation for all groups.

Her focus is on their construction of a "borderland" that marks their social reality. She explores the process of negotiating identity within different spheres of social life that could travel across psychological domains. Finally, she ends up questioning the metaphors we have to represent the multiple identity space: hybrid, hyphenated, cross-border, and bicultural, to name a few. She points out that most of these terms build on an assumption that the psychological experience of living in between worlds is equivalent to experiencing the self as divided. Yet, as the author demonstrates, multiplicity in identity can be a psychological strength and a wellspring of meaningful action. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background/Context: This study examines the tactics that Haitian immigrant parents used to negotiate the boundaries around home and school, presenting the possibility that families play an active and deliberate role in creating distance between the worlds of home and school. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The following research questions were explored: (1) Why do Haitian immigrant parents resist bridges between the worlds of home and school? (2) How might this resistance be seen as a show of agency? (3) How do the resistance and agency of Haitian immigrants complicate the in-school/out-of-school dichotomy and push theories that too easily bring in-school and out-of-school worlds together? Setting: Greater Boston, Massachusetts. Population/Participants/Subjects: Participants were 54 parents of Haiti-born (1.5 generation) and U.S.-born (second generation) Haitian American adolescents. Research Design: The study draws from a subset of data collected with Haitian families in a large longitudinal study of newly arrived immigrants from five different countries and from data collected in a supplemental study of second-generation Haitian families. Data sources include structured interviews and field notes. Data Collection and Analysis: Data were collected by bilingual, bicultural research assistants. Interviews were recorded whenever possible, transcribed, and, if necessary, translated to English. Data were analyzed for this article using classic qualitative thematic analysis techniques. Findings/Results: The findings suggest that parents actively constructed and reconstructed distinct boundaries for home and school rather than being passive victims of these boundaries. Three metathemes and seven related themes emerged related to the research questions: protecting the home terrain (displayed as a concern with family privacy; parental strictness; and discouraging friendships); equating schools with Americanization (shown through criticisms of U.S. schools/schooling; and parents’ limited contact with school), and negotiating a seat at the table (through parental advocacy; and reciprocal partnership-seeking) Conclusions/Recommendations: These findings question the pervasive notion in educational literature and practice that close links between home and school should be the goal of both teachers and families.

Abstract = {This research examines the mediating role of emotions implicated in the multicultural experience—creativity link. We propose that when individuals are dealing with apparent cultural contradictions upon encountering two cultures simultaneously, mentally juxtaposing dissonant cultural stimuli could lower positive affect or increase negative affect, which could in turn induce a deeper level of cognitive processing of cultural discrepancies and inspire creativity. Two studies compared dual cultural exposure versus single cultural exposure among bicultural Singaporeans (Study 1) and compared self-relevant (jointly presenting local and foreign cultures) versus self-irrelevant (jointly presenting foreign cultures only) dual cultural exposure among monocultural Taiwanese (Study 2). As in past research, dual cultural exposure promotes creativity, particularly if one presented culture is self-relevant. Further, this effect was mediated by a less positive or a more negative emotional state. These findings illuminate the underlying influence of emotions activated by simultaneous exposure to diverse cultures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In globalized economies, people often encounter symbols of dissimilar cultures simultaneously. Research on the psychological effects of simultaneous exposure to dissimilar cultures is therefore strategically located at the intersection of globalization, culture, and psychology. In seven experiments, we showed that exposure to a commercial product that embodies symbols of two dissimilar cultures can enhance perceptibility of cultural differences (Experiments 2, 5, and 6) and perceptions of cultural incompatibility (Experiment 1). Furthermore, following simultaneous exposure to two dissimilar cultures, individuals may display defensive responses to “cultural contamination” of an iconic cultural brand when mortality concerns are salient (Experiments 3, 4, and 7). Finally, although we obtained a robust bicultural exposure effect across experiments, thoughtful elaboration about cultural complexities can attenuate this effect and its attendant defensive responses to “cultural contamination” (Experiments 5–7).

Abstract = {To investigate acculturation as it is influenced by Jewish identity, Russian Jewish immigrants born in the Former Soviet Union and American Jews of Eastern European ancestry were surveyed regarding their three identities: American, Jewish, and Eastern European ethnic/Russian. Study 1 examined perceived differences between the three cultures on a series of characteristics. Study 2 explored perceptions of bicultural identity distance between the American and Eastern European ethnic/Russian identities as a function of Jewish identity centrality. Findings revealed that for Russian Jews, Jewish identity centrality is related to less perceived distance between the American and Russian identities, suggesting that Jewish identity may bridge participants’ American and Russian identities. In contrast, for American Jews, Jewish identity centrality is not related to less perceived distance between the American and Eastern European ethnic identities. The authors discuss implications for the long-term acculturation of Russian Jews in the United States and the function of religion in acculturation.

Method: We compared recruitment strategies that yielded the enrollment target of 200 matched Latino and nonLatino families of children with ID and controls. Active recruitment strategies involved direct contact with potential participants; passive strategies included disseminating study information. Results: Effective outreach focused on community agencies where children had ongoing involvement and utilizing bilingual/bicultural staff. Latino families were significantly more likely to be recruited by an active strategy than non-Latino families. Active and passive strategies were both effective with non-Latino ID families. Asking research participants to inform other families about the study and sharing consent to contact lists with other investigators was productive with control families. Conclusions: Bilingual staff and active recruitment through familiar community services were successful in recruiting Latino families for research.

Abstract = {Introduction: This study examined ethnoracial differences in lifetime and recent tobacco use and related problems in a large convenience sample of Latino, Black, and Non-Latino White emergency department (ED) patients. In addition, ED patients’ use rates were compared with those of a statewide sample. Methods: Trained bilingual/bicultural health educators screened almost 53,000 ED patients in 8 ED/trauma units throughout San Diego County over a 2-year period. Measures included sociodemographic characteristics and tobacco use measures from the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test brief screening instrument. Results: A consistent finding was the lower prevalence of tobacco use among Latino patients compared with Black and Non-Latino White patients. Compared with their general population counterparts, Non-Latino White, Latino, and Black patients were more likely to have used tobacco in their lifetime and on a daily basis. Conclusions: Results indicate the high tobacco risk status of ED patients, regardless of ethnicity. More work is needed to develop effective approaches for ED-initiated tobacco interventions for patients in various racial/ethnic groups. Offering tobacco cessation support in opportune venues such as the ED holds great potential to improve accessibility to public health interventions for many underserved communities who may not have regular interaction with a primary care provider.

Abstract = {Purpose: This study focused on whether developmental communication disorders exist in American Sign Language (ASL) and how they might be characterized. ASL studies is an emerging field; educators and clinicians have minimal access to descriptions of communication disorders of the signed modality. Additionally, there are limited resources for assessing ASL acquisition. This article is designed to raise clinicians’ awareness about developmental communication disorders in ASL and categorize types of atypicality that have been witnessed. Method: We conducted 4 focus groups and one 1-on-1 interview with a total of 22 adults (7 Deaf, 15 hearing) who work at bilingual–bicultural (ASL–English) schools for the Deaf. Experiences of these educators and language professionals were analyzed qualitatively using a combination of grounded theory (Charmaz, 2001; Strauss & Corbin, 1998) and a modified van Kaam approach (Moustakas, 1994). Results: Participants confirmed observations of children with suspected communication disorders and considered the prevalence, possible etiologies, and psychosocial aspects of such disorders in ASL. They reported frustration at the lack of diagnostic tools for reliable identification and intervention strategies to be used in educational settings. Conclusion: This work provides us with practitioner accounts proving that developmental communication disorders do exist in ASL. Future reports will describe primary data from signers with atypical language attributes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The basic premise for Bi-Bi programs then in existence and that have since been developed is that ASL should be the only form of sign communication, resisting presentation of English through a sign modality, and that the teaching of English should be confined to reading and writing. People have been calling for research for almost two decades now and it has not been forthcoming. Data, per se, will not solve highly emotional issues, but can provide some insight and help in making decisions about the future. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants' average length of residence in the U.S. was 25 years, 52% were normal weight, 41% were vegetarians, 55% incorporated aerobic activity into daily lifestyle, and only 5% smoked. Hypertension and diabetes were most common chronic diseases (31 and 18%, respectively). Younger age, longer length of residence and a bicultural or more American ethnic identity were associated with greater participation in physical activity. Likewise, higher income, a bicultural or more American ethnic identity and depression were associated with higher fat intake. Poor self-rated health was associated with older age, female gender, BMI > 25, satisfaction with social support, and greater number of chronic disease conditions. A multitude of factors influence the practice of healthy behaviors and the perceived health of Asian Indian immigrants, which should be addressed when developing culturally appropriate health promotion interventions.

Addressing challenges of theory, methods, and application in acculturation research requires ongoing advancements in methods and theoretical and model development. The current study was designed to explain a person-centered approach to investigating acculturation and biculturalism and to illustrate this method with a sample of 315 Hispanic youth. Pattern analyses of the Hispanicism and Americanism scores from the Bicultural Involvement Scale yielded four distinct acculturation types, including one characterized by moderate scores on both scales. Relations between acculturation types and indicators of individual, family, and peer adaptation were tested. Results indicated that bicultural youth tended to show the most adaptive pattern of functioning across multiple sociocultural domains. Assimilated youth did not show as strongly negative a pattern as has been reported elsewhere. Implications and benefits of a person-centered approach are discussed.

These immigrants are bicultural and bilingual not through birth, but through education and migration. Although Chinese immigrants (especially those from Hong Kong) often have some exposure to English and to Western culture prior to moving to Canada, they primarily learn cultures and languages consecutively, with each successive culture most strongly linked to its associated language. We examine whether language influences how bicultural Chinese immigrants think about and evaluate themselves.

Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study is to describe how mental healthcare providers adapted their practice to meet the unique needs of Asian Americans. Background: As the number of ethnic minorities and multicultural patients and families rapidly increases, cultural competency becomes an essential skill for all healthcare providers. The lack of knowledge about how healthcare providers grapple with diverse cultures and cultural competency limits the ability of others to deliver patient‐centred care across cultural lines. Methods: Interpretive phenomenology guided the design and conduct of this study. Twenty mental healthcare providers who treated Asian Americans were recruited. Narrative data were collected through face‐to‐face, in‐depth interviews between 2006 and 2007. Results/findings.: Three characteristics of culturally appropriate care for Asian Americans were identified. Cultural brokering: providers addressed issues stemming from cultural differences via bicultural skills education. Asian American patients generally received broader education than current literature recommended. Supporting families in transition: providers assisted Asian American families during transition from and to professional care. Using cultural knowledge to enhance competent care: providers’ knowledge of Asian culture and flexible attitudes affected the care that they provided. Culturally competent providers were able to identify cultural issues that were relevant to the specific situation, and incorporated cultural solutions into the care provided. Conclusion: Culturally appropriate care is nuanced and context specific. Thus, more sophisticated and broader conceptualizations are necessary to prepare nurses for such complex practice.

Setting: Four northern California counties. Sample: 330 Latina breast cancer survivors within one to five years of diagnosis. Methods: Telephone survey conducted by bilingual and bicultural interviewers. Main Research Variables: Predictors were sociodemographic and clinical factors, cancer self-efficacy, spirituality, and social support from family, friends, and oncologists. Outcomes were functional limitations and self-rated health. Findings: Twenty-two percent of women reported functional limitations (n = 73) and 27% reported poor or fair self-rated health (n = 89). Unemployment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] [2.04, 24.461), mastectomy (AOR = 2.67; 95% CI [1.06, 6.77]), and comorbidity (AOR = 4.09; 95% CI [1.69, 9.89]) were associated with higher risk of functional limitations; cancer self-efficacy had a protective effect (AOR = 0.4, 95% CI [0.18, 0.9]). Comorbidity was associated with higher risk of poor or fair self-rated health (AOR = 4.95; 95% CI [2.13, 11.47]); cancer self-efficacy had a protective effect (AOR = 0.3; 95% CI [0.13, 0.66]). Conclusions: Comorbidities place Latina breast cancer survivors at increased risk for poor health. Cancer self-efficacy deserves more attention as a potentially modifiable protective factor. Implications for Nursing: Nurses need to assess the impact of comorbidity on functioning and can reinforce patients' sense of control over cancer and clinician support.

Husbands and wives from thirty-five traditional and thirty-five bi-cultural intact families participated in the study. Participants were interviewed to collect data. MANOVA analyses reveal that whereas husbands and wives from traditional families showed higher levels of collectivism than the husbands and wives in bi-cultural families, husbands and wives in both traditional and bicultural families showed a similar level of individualism. Qualitative accounts further suggest that although these Navajos largely adhere to their traditional collectivist world view, many of them are in transition to adapt to an individualistic self-other perspective.

Abstract = {There have been moves in a number of countries in recent years to develop appropriate pedagogies for the teaching of community/heritage languages, distinct from foreign language and mother tongue models. At the same time there has been a growing interest in ways of developing learners’ creative abilities and there are grounds for believing that an approach which gives priority to this may be especially fruitful for bilingual/bicultural learners. This study examined the contribution that arts-based creativity involving stories, art works, dance, drama and multimedia can make to the learning and teaching of community/heritage languages in the British context. Using largely qualitative research methods, data were collected in four London schools, two mainstream and two complementary (voluntary, community based) over three terms. Key findings arising from analysis clustered around four broad areas: language and literacy, cognition, intercultural understanding, personal and social development. As well as identifying the impact on learners, insights were gained into pedagogy and professional development and these are also commented upon.

Abstract = {The current studies investigate whether different forms of fatalistic thinking follow from the Christian and Hindu cosmologies. The authors found that fatalistic interpretations of one’s own life events center on deity influence for Christians, especially for those high in religiosity; however, Hindu interpretations of one’s own life emphasized destiny as much as deity (Study 1). Also, the focus on fate over chance when explaining others’ misfortunes depends on the presence of known misdeeds for Christians, but not for Hindus (Study 2). Finally, Christians prefer petitionary prayer over divination as a strategy for managing uncontrollable future risks (Studies 3a and 3c), and preference for these strategies can be primed in bicultural Hindu Americans by a Hindi-accented telephone interviewer (Study 3b).

Abstract = {Across the nation, minority populations face significantly greater risk than Caucasians with regard to obesity and its related conditions. In order to make interventions available to minority communities, researchers and program developers have adapted and tailored existing programs for use with minority populations. To achieve a good fit, several components were considered in all aspects of the program, including both surface modifications, such as bilingual-bicultural educators, material translation, and incentive selections, as well as deep-structure characteristics of culture such as common values and culturally appropriate mealtime practices. Applying principles of cultural adaptation, as well as lessons learned from the authors' own development and implementation of community-based participatory research and programs, the Nutrition Education Aimed at Toddlers and Animal Trackers for children ages 2-4 (NEAT AT2) program was developed and delivered with funding from the First 5 Commission of San Diego County. Adaptation of the original NEAT curriculum to create and deliver NEAT AT2 was intended to produce a program that is both feasible and acceptable to a culturally and linguistically unique population—key ingredients to its ultimate efficacy. Early indicators demonstrate that the cultural adaptation of NEAT holds the promise of the original. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Although there have been significant advances in the status and use of ASL in the United States, there also have often been backlashes to such developments. The latter have typically been manifested in controversies over beliefs about the nature of ASL as a "real" or an "appropriate" language for study. This has been the case, for instance, in four particular areas: efforts to achieve official recognition of ASL, early identification of hearing impairment and ASL, the rise of ASL-English bilingual/bicultural education programs, and the teaching of ASL as a foreign language in educational institutions. In this article, the debate over the status of ASL is addressed as an example of ideological beliefs that impact linguistic judgments and policies. Also discussed are the major challenges to the status of ASL with respect to formal legislative recognition, its use as a medium of instruction, and its designation as a legitimate foreign language, all of which are both empirically and conceptually problematic. Further, it is suggested that the resistance to ASL is grounded in large part in a misunderstanding of the nature of human language and of the nature, structure, and history of natural sign languages in general and ASL in particular.

Abstract = {The study of caregiver burden is important for those raced with chronic illnesses such as AIDS as caregivers are the first line of care provision, sustaining care recipients in the home. Because perception of burden may vary across caregiver cultural groups, accurate measurement of burden is crucial to offer culturally sensitive services for those providing in-home care. The purpose of this study was to test the factor structure of a rapid assessment instrument, the Latina Caregiver Burden Scale, in a sample of 154 newly immigrated Latina caregivers primarily of Mexican descent Face-to-face interviews were conducted in Spanish and English by bilingual, bicultural interviewers. The findings suggest that aspects of caregiver burden for these low-income women are tied to factor structures associated with depression and guilt mentality, socioeconomic stress, and stigma linked with HIV/AIDS. Social workers have greater likelihood of accurate cultural assessment of caregiver burden in similar groups when using such research-supported measures.

Abstract = {A conceptual model is presented that approaches identity formation of American Indian adolescents according to 3 levels of social contextual influence—local, national, and global—relative to types of identity, dynamics of identity, and sources of influence. Ethnic identity of American Indians is embedded within the local cultural milieu and encompasses an array of dimensions organized around identification, connection, and culture/spirituality. The national or societal level brings additional complexities according to bicultural, multicultural, and hybrid types of identity. There is little known about the global implications of identity formation for American Indian adolescents, but a review of the construct of indigenous identity provides some guidance along with examination of identity formation of indigenous youth in other parts of the world. Suggestions for research are provided throughout the article, and theoretical implications for the broader topic of American Indian identity formation are provided with particular discussion of indigenous psychologies.

Abstract = {Aims: To explore whether and how immigrant general practitioners (GPs) in two major cities in Norway think that their own ethnic background affects their practices and their work. Methods: Qualitative focus group and individual interviews with seven immigrant GPs, five men and two women, age 36–65 years. Their clinical experience in Norwegian primary health care ranged from four to 30 years. Analysis was conducted by systematic text condensation. Results: First, immigrant GPs described a gradual process of becoming bicultural: the GPs communicate with immigrant patients on their own terms and draw upon their special knowledge from abroad to help selected patients, while also adapting to Norwegian cultural expectations of the GP’s role. Second, the GPs described being aware of cultural issues in consultations with immigrant and Norwegian patients, but rarely making these issues explicit. The GPs ventured that cultural awareness, together with their personal experience in their own countries and as immigrants in Norway, made them able to sometimes help immigrant patients better than Norwegian GPs. Third, immigrant GPs experienced a big workload related to immigrant patients, but they accepted this as a natural part of their work. Fourth, immigrant GPs felt that they had to work harder and be more careful than their Norwegian colleagues in order to avoid complaints from patients, and to be accepted by colleagues. Conclusions: Immigrant GPs express broad cultural competence and keen cultural awareness in their consultations. The immigrant background of these GPs could be considered as a special resource for clinical practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Misunderstanding of prescription labels results in adverse drug events and non-adherence. We assessed the effect of limited English and other factors on prescription understanding among five ethnic groups in a controlled analysis. Design: Subjects were respondents to California’s 2007 Health Interview Survey who received a prescription in the past year. In separate logistic regressions, limited English’s effect on self-reported prescription understanding—controlling for bilingual doctor, education level, medications for chronic conditions, disability, years in USA, citizenship and socio-demographics—was estimated for Mexicans, Central Americans, Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese. Results: Unweighted sample size was 48,968. Approximately 14% had limited English and 8% had difficulty in understanding prescriptions. In multivariate analysis, limited English increased odds of difficulty in understanding prescriptions by three times for Mexicans, Central Americans, and Koreans, and four times for Chinese; it was insignificant for Vietnamese. Generally, having a bilingual doctor reduced odds of difficulty while disability, low education, low income or recent immigration increased odds of difficulty. Effects varied according to the ethnic group. In controlled analysis, Chinese and Korean ethnicity increased odds of difficulty compared to Mexican or Central American ethnicity; Vietnamese ethnicity reduced odds of difficulty compared to others. Conclusions: Limited English blocked prescription understanding for all groups except Vietnamese. Translated prescription labels and interpreted in-person pharmacy consultations are indicated. Education and ethnicity affected prescription understanding; prescription instructions must be compatible with patients’ educational level and culture. Bilingual/bicultural providers and interpreters can help bridge linguistic/cultural gaps but efforts should be made to ensure that they are truly culturally and linguistically concordant. Linguistic, cultural or educational needs should be noted in the patient’s record or on the prescription to alert pharmacy staff. Sub-populations needing extra support include chronically ill, disabled, recent immigrants, low-income or rural inhabitants. Community outreach workers may provide an effective strategy for assisting these sub-populations with prescriptions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The purpose of this special section is to describe culturally competent approaches for working with translators or interpreters who participate in transcultural studies. This article provides background for three exemplars of lessons learned in working with translators in transcultural studies: (a) the resettlement transition experiences of women from the Dinka tribe of Southern Sudan (Baird), (b) Samoans’ risk for heart disease (Siaki), and (c) culturally Deaf adults’ perceptions about depression (Sheppard). Capitalizing the word "Deaf" has gained wide acceptance to indicate a linguistic minority of people who have a hearing loss and use American Sign Language, a hallmark of Deaf culture. In each case, the individual researcher made adaptations to the usual processes of translation/back-translation when appropriate to the cultural context and the specific situations of the translators. Although these lessons were learned during research-related activities, they may apply to other circumstances when nurses work with bilingual/bicultural translators (e.g., translating consent forms or communicating with persons who have limited literacy in their native language).

Abstract = {Immigration presents a major life challenge, especially when the move is both geographical and across wide cultural divides. One of the areas of greatest challenge is in adjustments in gender and marital roles, perhaps because both of these are so close to the core of identity, self esteem, and sense of place in the world. This paper reports on research conducted with immigrants from Iran to Canada that examined how their experiences post-immigration affected their marital roles and relationship. Fifteen men and fifteen women who were born in Iran, immigrated to Canada, and were currently in heterosexual marriage or marriage-like relationships participated in in-depth interviews. Participants were well-educated, with none having less than 12 years of schooling and most having post-secondary training. Three highly imbricated areas of influence on their couple relationships emerged in the interviews: gender role adjustments, labour force difficulties, and changes in family structure. Consistent with the literature on immigrant adjustments, both men and women found each of these 3 posed challenges to their couple relationships. Men had difficulty accepting the freedom their wives had to dress, socialize and make decisions for themselves. Women also identified shortcomings to the “freedoms” they were afforded in Canada. The greatest challenge to men’s identities as “good husbands” was their loss of the breadwinner role. Women and men both faced difficulties integrating into the Canadian labour force, with these difficulties leading some to express a desire to return to Iran. The loss of extended family support and social networking were linked to loneliness and absence of wise mediators to help with couple-conflicts, but were also described as contributing to greater mutuality and closeness in couples. Couples spoke of creating a new, bicultural, identity and lifestyle to counter the stresses and tensions of acculturation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The study explored the content and hierarchical structure of representations of New Zealand national character and identity. We argue that at the most abstract level perceived elements of New Zealand national character reflect a tension between two different domains. The first reflects an Anglicized monocultural representation of what it means to be a “true New Zealander” derived primarily from dominant majority (NZ European or Pākehā) groups’ symbols and values. The second reflects an inclusive recognition, albeit tokenized, of symbolic aspects of Māori culture and pluralistic intergroup relations. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified five distinct sub-factors of national character nested within these two broader exclusive (Anglicized monocultural) and inclusive (pluralist) factors (or overall representations). Monocultural aspects of national character included representations of rugby/sporting culture, citizenship and ancestry, and to a lesser extent patriotic values. Pluralistic aspects of national character, in contrast, included representations of cultural/bicultural awareness and liberal democratic values, but also patriotism. The socio-cultural geneses of this hierarchically-organized representational structure are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Like its predecessors, this edition is based on literature that describes recommended practices in human services, literature on intercultural effectiveness, and insights and information from the contributing authors who are bicultural, often bilingual, and always strong advocates for improving programs and services. Its primary purpose is to be of use to the full range of professionals who provide educational, health care, and social services (e.g., educators, nurses, speech-language pathologists, audiologists, occupational and physical therapists, physicians, social workers, psychologists, nutritionists) to families of children who have, or are at risk for special needs. Its secondary purpose is to speak to those who influence service delivery—to reach the administrators, politicians, and policy makers whose attitudes and beliefs affect service providers and families alike. Regardless of the program, the service, or one's professional discipline or role, facilitating cross-cultural competence is an obligation because it is prerequisite to quality services. Although children with special needs and their families are highlighted in this edition, much of the information and many of the examples are equally applicable to all children, families, and service providers across many other programs and settings. This edition is organized into three parts. Part I introduces the issues that surround working with families from diverse cultural, ethnic, and language groups. Part II is the core of the book.

Abstract = {Substantial variations have been found in the ways in which individuals within different cultural groups identify themselves. Typically, members of individualistic national cultures perceive themselves as more independent of others, while members of collectivistic national cultures perceive themselves as more interdependent with others. In early studies, self-construal was most frequently conceptualised as a relatively trait-like quality that could be measured by open-ended self-description or by self-report scales. To be validly employed, data from such measures need to be analysed in ways that take account of cultural differences in the tendency to acquiescent responding. Independent and interdependent self-construals have been found to correlate with cross-national differences in a wide variety of social behaviours. More recently, greater account has been taken of individuals' capacity to choose between a range of personal and social identities, dependent upon the salience of alternative social contexts. The effect of context is much greater among respondents from collectivistic cultures. The contrast between independent and interdependent self-construal has proved oversimple, and a range of alternatives has been proposed. A distinction between individual, relational and collective identities may more validly capture the range of cross-cultural variation. Given that self-construals are mutable, experimental priming techniques can be used to determine the extent to which variations in self-construal are able to cause effects that are equivalent to cultural differences in social cognition. Recent studies have focused primarily on bicultural respondents, and the utility of priming studies to explain differences between monocultural populations remains to be determined.

Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that talk about immigration can function to produce, reproduce and stabilize racism (Capdevila & Callaghan, 2008). In New Zealand (NZ), changes in immigration policy have seen a rapid increase in diverse groups of migrants with varied cultural backgrounds entering the country in the past two decades. Given its unique colonial history and 'settler nationality in a bicultural nation' (Bell, 2009), we explored how young NZ adults talk about and produce meanings and understandings of immigration, immigrants and cultural diversity. Appealing to notions of NZ as 'one society', as English speaking, and as English looking participants constructed NZ, NZ national identity and the NZ economy in particular ways. This constituted a nationalist rhetoric that was taken up in common-sense ways by participants to legitimize racist talk whilst simultaneously acting to locate participants themselves as reasonable and moral individuals. It is concluded that nationalist discourses function to reinforce patterns of social dominance and perpetuate the notion of New Zealanders as largely white, European-looking and English-speaking.

Abstract = {The Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA) is the most widely used measure of acculturation for Asians. The purpose of the current study was twofold: First, the study explored the consistency of the SL-ASIA in characterizing Asian American men's level of acculturation – Asian-Identified, Western-Identified, Bicultural—using the items of the scale in orthogonal versus linear approaches. Second, the study examined the association between the two scoring methods and characteristics indicative of Asian culture—family allocentrism, loss of face, and affect intensity. An orthogonal approach suggests individuals may identify both with Asian and Western cultures, whereas a linear approach indicates an individual identifies with one culture at the expense of the other (e.g., high Asian, low Western identified). We examined the classification rates of these two methods using a large sample of Asian-American collegiate men (n =521) and then within each ethnic subgroup of Asian men (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean). Results suggested the two methods of characterizing men consistently diverged. Across the Asian subgroups, the overall agreement rates using linear and orthogonal methods were approximately at chance. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed among acculturation scoring methods and variables indicative of social integrity and family attitude. The implications for these findings and potential future directions for the study of acculturation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Hispanic females are disproportionately affected by substance abuse, intimate partner violence, and HIV. Despite these disparities, research describing the cultural and gender-specific experiences of Hispanic women with regard to these conditions is lacking. The purpose of this study is to describe the experiences that Hispanic community-dwelling women have with regard to substance abuse, violence, and risky sexual behaviors. Eight focus groups with 81 women were conducted. A bilingual, bicultural moderator asked women open-ended questions regarding the experiences that Hispanic women have with these conditions. Focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed, translated, verified, and then analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Participants discussed substance abuse, violence, and risky sexual behaviors interchangeably, often identifying common risk factors associated with these. Nevertheless, intimate partner violence was the most salient of conditions discussed. Three major themes emerged from the analysis: Transplantadas en otro mundo (Uprooted in another world), El criador de abuso (The breeding ground of abuse), and Rompiendo el silencio (Breaking the silence). This study supports the importance of addressing substance abuse, violence, and risk for HIV in an integrated manner and stresses the importance of addressing associated cultural factors (e.g., acculturation, machismo) in interventions targeting Hispanics.

Abstract = {It is widely assumed that a strong sense of ethnic identity is associated with greater adjustment and well-being of American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents. Available evidence supports this proposition, but there are complexities related to ethnic identity development that support a call for further research in this area. This chapter addresses those complexities and provides a review of the extant literature within this context. We begin by delineating the scope of this chapter, identifying limitations and issues related to the study of development in American Indian/Alaska Native youth. Conceptual models of ethnic identity are then reviewed, followed by an articulation of unique dimensions of American Indian/Alaska Native identity and consideration of historical impacts on ethnic identity formation. The limited research on adolescent American Indian/Alaska Native ethnic identity is then reviewed, followed by discussion of several significant questions for future research. Given this critical review of theory and research, implications for applying this knowledge toward enhancing ethnic identity among American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents are suggested. This chapter provides a review of extant theory and research on ethnic identity among American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents. Before we begin that review, however, there are two relevant points of clarification that inform the scope of this chapter. First, confusion among different areas and overlap between related constructs make it particularly difficult to integrate the literature on American Indian/Alaska Native ethnic identity development. Terms such as ethnic identity, cultural identity, bicultural identity, acculturation, and enculturation are often used without clear specification of exactly what these constructs mean or how they are related to one another. Each of these constructs has at times included components of identification with American Indian/Alaska Native culture, sense of belonging to the cultural group, ethnic pride, participation in traditional activities, and endorsement of cultural beliefs and worldviews. We explicitly omitted racial identity in this chapter and will not stray into the extensive debate regarding its distinction from ethnic identity; the bulk of the racial identity research deals with African American populations and their unique experiences as a minority group in the United States, and is not directly relevant to a discussion of American Indian/Alaska Native ethnic identity. However, there are lessons to be learned from the racial identity literature that can inform our attempts to understand ethnic identity among American Indian/Alaska Native youth. Similarly, there exists an extensive literature on acculturation among immigrant groups (primarily various Latino and Asian groups), but these are also outside the scope of this chapter.

Abstract = {In this article we reflect on the recruitment of research participants to two related studies of experiences of mental health problems in Black and minority ethnic communities in the United Kingdom. A total of 65 people were recruited via three main strategies: the employment of bicultural recruiters, intensive information sharing about the studies, and work through local community groups. Three main issues seemed to affect recruitment: gatekeepers' attitudes, the (non)payment of participants, and reciprocal arrangements with local community groups. The type of strategy employed resulted in recruits with differing characteristics (although our sample was too small to draw generalizable conclusions). We conclude that to ensure that research participation is accessible to all, researchers must employ flexible recruitment methods that permit adaptation to specific needs arising out of health status, level of involvement with services, culture, and socioeconomic status. Systematic research into this part of the research process is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Multicultural education is a curriculum reform movement expressive of the mainstream of the American sociopolitical tradition. As a reform movement multicultural education has attempted to redress issues of power relationships as expressed in the ideology of the long-established general education program inherent in most U.S. schools, but particularly as nested in the language arts and social studies curriculum. Given its narrative orientation, a paradigmatic definition of multicultural education is extremely difficult. A scholarly attempt at definition is as challenging as herding cats, because the movement is defined not in terms of a common agenda as much as it is defined in terms of opposition to the status quo. Fortunately, one of the more enduring categorizations of the multicultural tradition over the past two decades was created by Sleeter and Grant. Currently in its fifth edition, Making Choices for Multicultural Education draws on five approaches to multicultural education identified by Gibson: 1. education of the culturally different; 2. education about cultural differences; 3. education for cultural pluralism; 4. bicultural education; and 5. multicultural education. Sleeter and Grant, however, move beyond the approach of Gibson to create their own typology: 1. teaching the exceptional and culturally different; 2. human relations approach; 3. single-group studies approach; 4. multicultural education approach; and 5. multicultural social justice approach. The attraction of the Sleeter and Grant approach is that it attempts to capture the evolving nature of the multicultural education reform movement as it has refocused from issues of cultural exclusion to issues of power. This historical view of the multicultural education reform movement gives directionality to the drift of reform, and accordingly provides a vantage point from which to anticipate difficulties for the movement in the future. This chapter will use the Sleeter and Grant categorization as a template for surveying the movement, and as a vantage point for looking ahead. A second organizing principle for this chapter is the dimensional typology provided by James Banks. Banks identifies five dimensions of educational outcomes of particular relevance to multicultural education. These are: 1. content integration; 2. knowledge construction; 3. prejudice reduction; 4. equity pedagogy; and 5. empowering school culture. Drawing on these educational outcomes as they are expressed in each of the approaches of the Sleeter and Grant typology, processes of comparison across approaches will be facilitated.

Abstract = {The present study tests and extends existing research about the effects of culture and self-construal on reports of accommodative dilemmas in dating relationships. Data were collected from members of three different regional cultures: U.S. mainland, Hawaii, and South Korea. Using a four-factor self-construal model, two hypotheses were posited: (i) members of collectivistic cultures tend to enact accommodation (loyalty, voice) more and nonaccommodation (neglect, exit) less than do their individualistic counterparts; and (ii) bicultural self-construal is more strongly associated consistently with accommodation than are the other three self-construal types. These hypotheses received support. Collectivism-individualism was related consistently with the type of accommodation, and the four self-construal types also displayed a reliable pattern of associations with accommodation and nonaccommodation. Post-hoc assessments revealed that the four-factor model predicted self-reported accommodation better than did the two-factor model used in previous research. Small effect sizes in the present study, however, suggest that other factors (e.g., industrialization) may have a considerable bearing on responses to accommodative dilemmas.

Abstract = {Bicultural and interreligious marriages always end up in divorce. Divorce rates are skyrocketing in Muslim communities. Muslims are immune from domestic violence because it is prohibited (or, alternatively, Muslims have high rates of domestic violence because it is sanctioned in the Qur'an). These are just some of the claims that are often circulated in Muslim communities, not only by community residents but even sometimes by imams and community leaders. Yet, what is the source of such claims? It certainly is not the scientific research literature. Unfortunately, mental health research has lagged behind the community’s need for valid and reliable answers to common questions and concerns. The theme of this issue of the Journal of Muslim Mental Health is marriage and family, illustrating how the burgeoning field of Muslim mental health is generating empirical research to address some of the community’s concerns and questions. Two of the articles examine controversial topics; namely, the Qur'anic verse 4:34, and current marriage and divorce trends in the United States. Two more articles focus on the virtually ignored topic of intercultural and interreligious marriages, introducing information on the motivations and experiences of North African Muslim–Italian Catholic marriages in Italy and Jewish-Arab marriages in Israel. The findings in all these articles pose significant challenges to the conventional "community wisdoms" listed at the beginning of this editorial and, as a whole, stimulate the scholarly discourse to search for answers at a more complex and meaningful level.

Abstract = {New Zealanders' implicit projections of the national category differ dramatically from those of Americans and Australians. In these latter nations, research using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) indicates that the majority (White/European) group is privileged in automatic or nonconscious concepts of nationhood relative to other ethnic groups. In New Zealand, however, Whites/Europeans and Maori (the Indigenous peoples) are equally associated with cognitive representations of the nation. This difference has been attributed to the strong and consensual integration of Maori culture and identity with national identity. The present research provided a novel test of this argument by demonstrating, in a large undergraduate sample (N = 142), that self-rated opposition versus support for symbolic but not resource-specific aspects of bicultural social policy was associated with New Zealanders' generalized pro-European versus pro-Maori implicit ethnic-national associations (estimated using two IATs). This finding provides converging evidence suggesting that the unique pattern of ethnic-national associations observed in New Zealand owes its genesis to relatively consensual support for the incorporation of symbolic aspects of Maori culture: The ways in which groups are symbolically represented within a nation affects the extent to which they are automatically projected within the inclusive or national prototype. This in turn has important implications for promoting intergroup tolerance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Conversely, bilingual-bicultural programs are advocated on the hypothesis that well-developed sign language skills and visual coding strategies (based on sign language) may offer deaf children phonological/orthographic link, thus enhancing their written English skills. To test this hypothesis, this study used a quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design among prelingually profoundly deaf (late-signing) elementary-phase children attending a residential school for the Deaf in rural South Africa (treatment group: N = 32, mean age = 119.19 months, SD = 22.73, comparison group: N = 32, mean age = 117 months, SD = 21.36). After a year of computer-based exercises explicitly guiding them in fingerspell coding, visual imaging and the principles of “print-language mapping” between South African Sign Language and English, the pre- and post-test results revealed that the treatment group had made significant gains in spelling proficiency.

The authors then shift focus to the main tenet of this article, namely, that specific aspects of the dual language development of immigrant children are highly relevant to their mental health and adaptation. This argument is illustrated with empirical studies on Latino immigrant children, as they represent the majority of immigrant children in America and as a way of exemplifying the risks and circumstances that are potentially shared by other immigrant groups. Finally, the authors conceptually differentiate dual language development and its mental health impact from the dual-culture (bicultural) development and circumstance of immigrant children and their mental health impact.

Abstract = {In Euro-Canadian culture, individuals often base decisions on what they think will make them happy, such that affective forecasts play an important role in driving decisions. In contrast, East Asian cultures warn against excessive hedonism, suggesting that expected positive emotions may have less influence on decision making among East Asians. Consistent with this hypothesis, those with an East Asian cultural background in Study 1 were less likely than Euro-Canadians to choose an enjoyable activity over a useful one. Study 2 showed that East Asians, versus Euro-Canadians, place less weight on expected enjoyment when making hypothetical choices. In Study 3, biculturals placed less weight on expected enjoyment when primed with interdependent versus independent self-construals. We argue that expected enjoyment plays a significant role in decision making across cultures, but that this role may be attenuated for individuals from East Asian cultures due to their interdependent sense of self.

Abstract = {Mexican Americans are at particular risk of contracting tuberculosis. Yet too little is known about perceptions influencing their health. This study investigated gender and acculturation differences in TB-specific Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs, and the applicability of the HBM's traditional configuration to Mexican Americans. Acculturation and gender substantially influenced the findings. Traditional Mexican Americans reported higher perceived susceptibility and seriousness, more barriers, and greater attention to cues regarding TB prevention than Highly Integrated Biculturals. Women reported greater benefits, attention to cues, and intent to engage in TB prevention behaviors than men. Highly Integrated Bicultural men reported less attention to cues and less intent to engage in health behaviors than other groups. The traditional HBM configuration did not fit this sample. Reconfiguration did, however, result in adequate fit. Overall, higher perceived susceptibility, action benefits, attention to media cues, and female gender predicted greater intent to engage in TB health behaviors.

Abstract = {This article describes the collaborative work of three teachers-two Arab and one Jewish-as they taught first grade together in a then new bilingual/bicultural school in Israel. The article is based on an ethnographic study the author conducted at the school during the school's first year (1998-1999), examining in particular the interactions between the teachers to determine how working collaboratively inside and outside of the same classroom context influenced each teacher's understandings about themselves and each other as Arab and Jew. Together, these three teachers negotiated their classroom work, entered into planning conversations, held discussions with parents and others, and shared teaching episodes. As they discovered and worked through the dilemmas of this collaborative work, they learned more about themselves as Arab and Jew, ultimately reshaping how they taught their students. As three teachers with different cultural histories, they were forced to reflect on their beliefs and actions from a number of perspectives as they engaged in the work of the school. They began to develop-or further develop in some cases-a critical consciousness in each other's company. This was particularly true for the Jewish teacher who is central in this article. It is her learning-as a member of the culture of power in Israel-that most closely resembles the potential learning that could be realized by today's teaching cohort in the United States if teacher educators create structures and opportunities that enable meaningful cross-cultural learning to take place. The author posits that a more collaborative and cross-cultural model of teaching and teacher learning is worth thinking about as teacher educators work to prepare teachers everywhere, particularly in the United States, to address the needs of the diverse students in today's schools.

Abstract = {This study explored the interrelationship between Deaf identity and self-concept. Very little research has explored Deaf identity and none has explored how perceptions of fit with the Deaf culture and Hearing culture influence self-concept. Conceptually, this study looks at cultural identification as falling along two dimensions-identification with the Deaf culture and identification with the Hearing (majority) culture, resulting in four categorical descriptors-culturally hearing, marginal, immersed, and bicultural. It was hypothesized that those who identify with both the hearing and Deaf culture (bicultural individuals) would have the best self-concept while those who identified as marginal would have the worst self-concept. The participants consisted of 46 students enrolled in a transitional program for the deaf and deaf and hard of hearing university students. Results supported the hypotheses (bicultural individuals had the highest self-concept and marginal individuals had the lowest). Additional tentative and exploratory hypotheses are also discussed. Clinical implications for family therapists of this research are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Cross-cultural studies usually compare the psychology of people from different countries and thus focus on how cultures influence people's psychology. In contrast, in 2000, Hong, Morris, Chiu, and Benet-Martinez demonstrated the dynamics of cultural influence within individuals who have been exposed extensively to two cultures (biculturals); they showed that exposing Chinese American biculturals to Chinese or American cultural icons activated the corresponding cultural (Chinese or American) knowledge systems, which, in turn, affected the biculturals' attributions (the cultural priming effects). This article further examines how applicability of activated cultural knowledge moderates the cultural priming effects. In two studies, the authors manipulated the individual versus group salience of an ambiguous social display and found that only when the individual versus group contrast was made salient was the group agency belief applicable and thus showed the cultural priming effects. As such, applicability sets the boundary condition for the dynamic construction of meaning under cultural influence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Views of the self differ in individualist and collectivist cultures. Independence and uniqueness are valued in the former, whereas interdependence and social context are valued in the latter. When there is more than 1 culture in the same context, the competent individual learns to become bicultural. Intrapersonal influences are more prominent in determining psychopathology in individualist contexts, whereas interpersonal influences are more prominent in collectivist contexts. Psychopathology among persons who are bicultural may be determined by both intrapersonal and interpersonal influences. Western psychotherapy has emphasized intrapersonal bases of psychopathology. However, the intrapersonal and bicultural context of psychopathology must be considered for psychotherapy to be appropriate with persons who have been socialized to be interdependent, including ethnic minority persons.

Abstract = {Examines cultural frame switching among bicultural Greek children (n=74; aged 9-12 yrs) living in the Netherlands. By means of experimentally primed bicultural children and the, use of monocultural comparison groups in the Netherlands (n=51) and Greece (n=58), it was demonstrated that social explanations, self- identification, and attitudes toward family integrity and obedience were affected by cultural identity salience. Compared to Dutch identity salience, activating Greek identity especially led to more external attributions, stronger identification with friends, a more positive evaluation of social identity, and a less positive evaluation of personal identity. Similar tendencies were found for the attitude measures. In addition, similar differences were found when comparing monocultural Dutch and monocultural Greek children. It is concluded that this kind of experimental study and its results help to improve our understanding of the experiences of bicultural individuals and the way culture influences people's lives.

Abstract = {This article presents findings from an ongoing study of urban teachers' efforts to embrace mathematics reform with student populations that are culturally, linguistically, and socioeconomically diverse (CLSD). We investigate the teacher's role in providing accessible and valuable mathematical learning opportunities to diverse students. Through narrative vignettes of practice and analyses of the personal and intellectual resources teachers draw on in CLSD contexts, we examine the challenges and possibilities two third-grade teachers face as they attempt such reform. One teacher's strengths were in making cultural connections with her students; the other's strengths were in pursuing complex and meaningful mathematics with her students. Building on our analysis, we offer a framework for examining the work of attending to mathematical and cultural issues simultaneously. Our findings suggest that such work is complex; however, teachers are seldom supported in their efforts to integrate these two perspectives. Our aim is to examine the dimensions of culturally relevant mathematics teaching and explore where the fields of mathematics and bilingual-bicultural education need to speak to one another.

The distinctness of a cultural group is rooted in a series of historical, sociocultural experiences and perceptions of oneself and the group as a whole. The development of ethnopsychology is summarized through the contributions of Rogelio Diaz-Guerrero and his early exploration of the fundamental premises and tenets that guide ethnopsychological theory and method. The contributions of other theorists, focusing on the uniqueness of bicultural/bilingual groups such as Mexican Americans, are also summarized. The author supports the application of ethnopsvchological theory and method to enhance psychologists' understanding of bilingual/bicultural groups in the US.

Respondents completed project staff administered self-reports surveys in their schools that included assessments of health behaviours, mental health, and socio-cultural variables--including acculturation level. Latinos were at higher risk than non-Latino Whites in the following areas- academic orientation, physical activity, and sunscreen use. Boys and those of lower social class were more likely to report use of various substances and violence. The study found important differences within Latinos using a bicultural acculturation model. The use of a bicultural acculturation model, or cultural orientation approach more generally, may have especial utility for addressing health issues wherever minority populations interact with a dominant society.

The study focused on 3 issues: (1) the level of heritage language proficiency and language use, (2) identification with Korean or American cultures, and (3) the relationship between cultural identity and heritage language proficiency. Results of qualitative and quantitative analyses of questionnaire data show that most 2nd-generation Korean-Americans achieve some level of Korean proficiency, but they overwhelmingly agree that it is not enough. They acknowledge the importance of knowing their heritage language, but feel that the existing language courses in the community-based language schools are not meeting their needs. The students stated that the absence of societal recognition of the importance in maintaining their heritage language was the most significant factor in their lack of motivation to maintain their heritage language. However, they appear to have formed a unique bicultural identity composed of characteristics from both Korean and American cultures. Heritage language proficiency was related to strength of bicultural identification. Implications for heritage language maintenance programs are discussed.

Abstract = {This book attempts to bridge the two fields of neurobiology and psychology of attention and to derive a comprehensive theory of attention from both neurobiological and psychological data. It highlights situations where attention can be seen to alter both neural activity and psychophysical performance/phenomenal experience. This "bicultural" approach contributes not only to attention research but to the larger goal of linking neural activity to conscious experience. The book focuses mainly on the effects of visual attention on the ventral and dorsal streams of the visual cortex in humans and monkeys and the associated changes in visual performance. Several larger findings emerge: attention may involve more than one neural system; attention modulates all stages of cortical visual processing; the effect of attention is constrained by the intrinsic connectivity of cortex and the resulting contextual interactions; and the notion of a "saliency map" remains central to thinking about visual attention. This book also considers several approaches to evaluating the same variable through different methods, such as behavioral measurements, functional imaging, and single-unit recording.

Abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to illustrate how 3 groups of formerly stigmatized minorities in Scandinavia try and rid themselves of negative aspects of their past and create a new and more positive minority identity. The Kven, the Tornedalians, and the Sami have all experienced a long period of harsh assimilation policies but today there is among all these groups a strong wish to maintain their own languages and cultures and to transmit them to the following generation. For the schools in Northern Scandinavia this has come to mean that they have to meet the needs of the minority children to a much greater degree than they have been accustomed to and to create an education that enables the children to achieve an additive bicultural situation: to be integrated in their majority peer group and the society at large without having to abandon their family culture and identity. In this chapter, cultural revitalization in school is seen as an opportunity to integrate these minority groups into the rest of the society on more equal premises than before, which in turn will contribute to the rehabilitation of stigmatized minority identities in northern Scandinavia.

Abstract = {This article reports on an experiment conducted that tested anti-tobacco advertising strategies aimed at a bicultural Mexican-American youth audience. The direct effects of three advertising themes (negative health consequences, social norms against smoking, and tobacco industry manipulation) and three language executions (English, Spanish, and "Spanglish") on adolescent Hispanics' evaluations of the advertisements were examined using a multilevel modeling approach. Additionally, participant-level measures for acculturation and tobacco-related attitudes and behaviors as potential moderators were included. Although all the tested advertisements were viewed favorably, results suggest that a negative health theme may be most effective in a community-wide campaign because it evokes the least amount of counter arguing among smokers while, at the same time, eliciting positive evaluations from nonsmokers. Results also support the use of either Spanglish or English in the design of anti-tobacco advertising aimed at Mexican-American youths. The study contributes to practical knowledge by examining these factors in stimuli with a high level of ecological validity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This article provides new insights into the study of acculturation based on a phenomenological research design, that is, in-depth and conscious descriptions and reflections. The in-depth descriptions illustrate the plurality and complexities inherent in the social networks and languages of highly skilled migrants in foreign countries, which transcend the customary local–foreign dichotomy. In Korea and Japan, Westerners may enjoy a moot advantage of being foreigners to whom superior knowledge and skills are ascribed, while simultaneously facing subtle forms of discrimination. Being aware of this situation, some migrants, for example bicultural and biracial people, might be able to take advantage of this ambivalent situation while simultaneously coping with discrimination.

Abstract = {Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics experience a disproportionate burden of chronic diseases. Understanding the factors influencing the success of health programs in Hispanics requires a clearer examination of the principles and components of tailored interventions. This research comprises a comprehensive literature review of randomized controlled trials testing nutrition and exercise interventions tailored for Hispanics and an examination of how these interventions were constructed. The review of 18 interventions meeting study criteria suggests that most tailored programs promoting nutrition and exercise in Hispanics are theory driven and are informed by formative research. Also, the findings indicate that salient culturally sensitive intervention components are (a) bilingual and bicultural facilitators and materials, (b) family-based activities, (c) literacy-appropriate materials, and (d) social support. A clear understanding of Hispanic cultural values is also required. Further empirical examination is warranted to determine the factors mediating or predicting the efficacy of culturally sensitive health programs for Hispanics.

Abstract = {We describe the history, development, and success of the recruitment and screening procedures used by researchers at the University of California, Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center (UCD ADC) to facilitate minority enrollment in research. After an initial, unsuccessful approach with satellite clinics in minority neighborhoods, the ADC shifted to an active community outreach approach. Multiple strategies were implemented to remove barriers to research participation such as providing transportation to clinical appointments and offering in-home cognitive screening. Considerable resources were directed toward hiring and training bicultural and bilingual individuals with knowledge of the target populations, both as recruiters and staff involved in clinical assessment. Implementation of these methods resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of ethnic minorities enrolled (and retained) in research protocols, including protocols that are complex and longitudinal. Diversity was achieved on other variables as well; years of education in the cohort range from 0 to 21, with 26% having 8 years or less. The community screen identified candidates for an in depth clinical evaluation and enrollment in longitudinal research, and we examined factors that predicted a positive response to invitation for the clinical evaluation. Individuals with a broader fund of knowledge were more likely to participate independent of other variables including ethnicity and education. When diversity is an important goal active outreach is far more efficacious than clinic-based and advertising-based approaches to recruitment.

Abstract = {Objectives: To pilot test the efficacy of a culturally tailored diabetes self-management social support intervention for Mexican American adults with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) living in the U.S.- Mexico border region and to test the feasibility of recruiting and training promotoras to participate in intervention delivery. Design and Sample: This study used a single-group pretest and posttest design. The convenience sample consisted of 21 Mexican American adults with T2DM. The setting for the study was a community in the Arizona-Sonora, Mexico border region. Interventions: A bilingual, bicultural certified diabetes educator (CDE) and a nurse researcher developed the intervention to improve T2DM self-management activities for Mexican Americans. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires, glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and anthropometric measures. Results: Intervention efficacy was demonstrated by an increase in participants’ diabetes self-management activities and diabetes knowledge and a decrease in diabetes-related distress and sedentary behaviors. There were no significant changes in physiologic outcomes. Feasibility of recruitment and training of 2 promotoras who participated in intervention delivery was established. Conclusions: Promotoras, in collaboration with a CDE, successfully delivered a culturally tailored diabetes self-management social support intervention for Mexican American adults with T2DM. This intervention positively affected diabetes self-management behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Individualism and collectivism, or self-construal style, refer to cultural values that influence how people think about themselves and their relation to the social and physical environment. Recent neuroimaging evidence suggests that cultural values of individualism and collectivism dynamically modulate neural response within cortical midline structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), during explicit self-evaluation. However, it remains unknown whether cultural priming modulates neural response during self-evaluation due to explicit task demands. Here we investigated how cultural priming of self-construal style affects neural activity within cortical midline structures during implicit self-evaluation in bicultural individuals. Results indicate that ventral MPFC showed relatively less deactivation during implicit evaluation of both self- and father-relevant information as compared to control condition (e.g., information of an unfamiliar person), irrespective of cultural priming. By contrast, dorsal MPFC showed relatively less deactivation during implicit evaluation of father-relevant information, but not self-relevant information, as compared to control condition, only when they were primed with individualism. Furthermore, dorsal MPFC showed relatively less deactivation during implicit evaluation of father-relevant information as compared to self-relevant condition only when they were primed with individualism. Hence, our results indicate that cultural priming modulates neural response within dorsal, but not ventral, portions of MPFC in a stimulus-driven rather than task-driven manner. More broadly, these findings suggest that cultural values dynamically shape neural representations during the evaluation, rather than the detection, of self-relevant information.

Abstract = {The development of cross-cultural psychology over the past 40 years is briefly reviewed. Cross-cultural psychologists have focused on differences between populations, explanations based on individualism-collectivism and reduction of explanations to the individual-level of analysis. Cultural variations have been incompletely sampled, with an excessive focus on North America and East Asia. However, the cross-cultural approach is compatible with the perspective of cultural psychologists because in both traditions there has been a focus both on mechanisms of cultural stability and of cultural change. Promising new developments are identified, including classifications of a broader range of cultures based on communication behaviors, contrasting ways of satisfying identity motives in individualistic and collectivist cultures, and the use of experimental cultural primes for theory testing within bicultural populations.

Abstract = {Background: The Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) program in California (Heart of the Family) implements lifestyle interventions to improve health behaviors while reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among low income, uninsured, or underinsured Hispanic women aged 40–64 who participate in the Cancer Detection Programs: Every Woman Counts (CDP: EWC). This study reports the first-year results of the California WISEWOMAN program. Methods: Heart of the Family is a within-site randomized controlled study with an enhanced intervention group (EIG) and a usual care group (UCG). The study was conducted between January 2006 and June 2007 at four community health centers in Los Angeles and San Diego counties. Lifestyle counseling focusing on health behaviors was provided by bilingual, bicultural (Spanish and English) community health workers. The study examines two outcome measures: changes in health behaviors; and changes in the CVD risk profile, as measured by the 10-year probability of having a coronary heart disease (CHD) event. Results: Women in the EIG group (n = 433), compared to those in the UCG group (n = 436), experienced more improvements in health behaviors, both eating habits and physical activity. The improvement in the 10-year CHD risk was greater for EIG than UCG women. Multiple regression results indicate that this improvement was significantly greater when the women’s CHD risk levels were in the upper quartile at baseline. Conclusions: Compared with UCG women, women in the EIG were more likely to improve their health behaviors. The CVD risk profile, as measured by the 10-year CHD risk, improved in women with the highest baseline risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Brazilians are among the fastest growing segment of immigrant populations in several states of the United States. Culturally appropriate and validated health survey instruments do not exist to adequately assess the health needs of this population. Through a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, a cross-cultural pilot project was conducted to develop and test a culturally-adapted Brazilian Portuguese-version of the health-promoting lifestyle profile II (HPLP-II) instrument with a convenience sample of 60 bilingual and bicultural Brazilian immigrants using a combined quasi experimental and focus group design. The project evaluated HPLP-II instrument’s psychometric properties of equivalency, reliability, and score distribution in Portuguese and English. This pilot test supports equivalency, consistency, and reliability of the English and culturally-adapted Brazilian Portuguese versions of the instrument. CBPR is an effective approach in health instrument development. This instrument is an important first step in designing other appropriate instruments to explore health conditions of Brazilian immigrants in the U.S. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Buddhism and Christianity present to their adherents distinctive and shared understandings of virtue, which are interpreted and lived out by their participants. This embodied, contextual understanding of the virtues is consistent with recent hermeneutic emphases within the literature (see, e.g., McCullough &amp; Snyder, 2000; Sandage &amp; Hill, 2001) and is best explored using qualitative methodology (Sandage, Cook, Hill, Strawn, &amp; Reimer, 2008). The current study examined the folk understandings of the everyday virtues among 12 Cambodian American Buddhist immigrants and 12 Cambodian American Christian immigrants, all of whom had been identified as virtuous exemplars by their peers. A comparison sample of 12 Euro-American Christians identified as virtuous exemplars from the same community were also interviewed as a further rigor-enhancing strategy. Participants were administered the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire—Revised and the Schwartz Value Scale. Thick descriptions of the virtues were derived from qualitative and quantitative data analyses, and trustworthiness was established by member checking, researcher reflexivity, and concurrent triangulation. Themes emerged from the data: duty and responsibility as distinctive motivations for virtue, the interrelatedness of the virtues, and the domains of their influence (societal in collectivist perspectives, narrower in individualist perspectives), as well as possible constraints on their practice (balance and moderation). Warmth-based virtues were generally described in religious terms, whereas conscientiousness-based virtues, described in religious terms by Cambodian American Buddhists, were described as cultural by Cambodian American Christians and more highly valued by Cambodian American Buddhists than Euro-American Christians.

Latent profile and transition analyses identified four distinct orientation profiles endorsed by the early adolescents and their developmental trends across four time points. Most Mexican and Mexican American adolescents endorsed bicultural profiles with developmental trends characterized by widespread stasis and transitions toward greater ethnic identity exploration. Multinominal logistic regression analyses revealed associations between profile endorsement and adolescents’ gender, socioeconomic status, parents’ birthplace, and visits outside the United States. These findings are discussed in regard to previous findings on acculturation and ethnic identity development. Individuals’ adaptation to the immediate local environment is noted as a possible cause of prevalent biculturalism.

Abstract = {In this study, we examined longitudinal, person-centered trajectories of acculturation, internalizing symptoms, and self-esteem in 349 Latino adolescents. We compared acculturation measures (time in the US, culture-of-origin involvement, US cultural involvement, for both parents and adolescents); acculturation stressors (perceived discrimination, acculturation conflicts); and family dynamics (parent–adolescent conflict, familism). Results indicated that, over time, Latino adolescents’ internalizing problems decreased and their self-esteem increased. However, we showed that increased length of time living in the US was significantly related to lower self-esteem among adolescents. Parent–adolescent conflict was a strong risk factor, which not only directly heightened internalizing symptoms and lowered self-esteem, but also mediated the effects of acculturation conflicts and perceived discrimination on these outcomes. Our findings revealed familism as a cultural asset associated with fewer internalizing symptoms and higher self-esteem. Internalizing symptoms were also minimized by the adolescent’s involvement in the US culture whereas bicultural adolescents with high culture-of-origin involvement reported higher self-esteem. We discussed the limitations and implications of this study for future research and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Intercountry adoption has been, and continues to be, a popular method of family formation worldwide, as well as a means of providing homes for children who would otherwise remain parentless. The popularity of this social welfare practice suggests that countless families continue to face the challenges of raising children whose ethnicities derive from two different ethnic backgrounds. Yet, virtually no research exists on the development of a bicultural ethnic identity in intercountry adoption. Instead, research has focused on the importance of birth-culture socialization, or the lack thereof. Faced with too little direct research on the subject, this paper synthesizes and critically reviews literature from the ethnic socialization, biracial, acculturation, and adoption fields. The aim was twofold: (1) extrapolate key elements of the literature that inform on the development of biculturalism in intercountry adoptions; and (2) identify gaps in the literature.

This may be particularly true of managers in emerging markets, many of whom experience an encroaching US culture due to media, migration, and trade, as well as the importation of US-style business education. This study explores the possibility of applying acculturation insights developed in the immigrant and sojourner contexts to the context of local managers in emerging markets. By exploring the acculturation of Mexican managers in Mexico, we help to redress what has been identified as a key omission in prior acculturation research—the acculturation of a majority population. Our results suggest that Mexican managers who are bicultural or culturally independent (cosmopolitan) are more likely to be in upper management positions in Mexico. Our study supplements earlier work supporting the efficacy of biculturalism in minority populations. It also supports a growing body of research that conceptualizes individuals who rate themselves low on similarity to two cultures as being cosmopolitans and not marginalized individuals who experience difficulty in life.

Abstract = {Immigration is common in this increasingly globalized world. Immigration is a psycho-social-geographical transition that involves a series of losses and changes, most of them obvious and expected, but some of them hidden and unexpected. Immigration also involves changes in one’s identity, as inner change tries to match outer change. The original story of immigration—by Abraham in the Bible—highlights some of the issues immigrants typically confront. A survey of Taiwanese immigrants in San Francisco and Vancouver, Canada illustrates some of the most troubling of these issues. Congregations, particularly bicultural congregations, are especially well-equipped to minister to the needs of the newly immigrated. Pastors need to be sensitive to the issues and needs of immigrants in a world where we are all foreigners in one sense or another. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Jayanthi Mistry & Jean Wu (see record [rid]2010-04357-002[/rid]). The authors introduce the concept of navigating across worlds, and this construct appears to represent a rough approximation of biculturalism. The authors address an important and neglected point when they note that biculturalism is facilitated by specific environmental conditions. Consistent with the author, familial ethnic socialization—the extent to which parents teach their children about the language, symbols, and traditions from the family’s heritage culture most strongly differentiated bicultural individuals from those adopting other approaches to acculturation. In this commentary, we have laid out some ideas regarding what biculturalism is, how it develops, and when it may be more or less adaptive. Biculturalism—as well as other approaches to acculturation—does not develop in isolation. Rather, it is likely a product of cultural and contextual forces that steer young people toward some cultural options and away from others. Acculturation is simultaneously intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextually influenced, and understanding the various factors that shape this process will provide a much needed understanding of cultural identity and adaptation.

The decisional process they go through in choosing a cultural identity is discussed and the difficulties met by some groups are examined. The third part begins with a discussion of why early bilingualism is crucial for the development of deaf children. The reasons that bilingualism and biculturalism have not normally had the favor of those involved in nurturing and educating deaf children are then discussed. They are of two kinds: misunderstandings concerning bilingualism and sign language; and the lack of acceptance of certain realities by many professionals in deafness, most notably members of the medical world. The article ends with a discussion of the role of the two languages in the development of deaf children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The children of immigrants are often referred to as second-generation youth. Although there is tremendous diversity among them, they often share the common experience of being bicultural by holding both heritage and mainstream cultural identities. Given that cultures generally promote similar expectations for youth (e.g., showing respect for parents), holding two cultural identities is not necessarily problematic. Even when cultural expectations do differ, these individuals can typically switch between cultural identities (e.g., South Asian at home; mainstream Canadian at school) as a strategy to avoid conflict. For some issues, however, switching between identities will not resolve the conflict because fulfilling the normative expectations associated with one identity is done at the expense of the ones of the other identity (e.g., choosing a romantic partner that is either from the heritage culture or from mainstream culture). The current paper presents a normative approach to understanding the experience of culturally-based conflicts among second-generation youth. In addition, research stemming from this normative approach in the area of intimate relationships is presented to further illustrate the value of the model in understanding the potential cultural conflicts of second-generation youth and how they may be negotiated.

Abstract = {By asking students to fill in 10 statements beginning with ‘I am…’ and a further 10 statements beginning with ‘I am not…’ we constructed profiles of British Muslim ethnic and national identity. Participants were 108 British Muslim girls of mean age 12.6 years studying in a single sex girls' school in Birmingham, UK. Using content analysis we found that some adolescent girls are rooted only in their personal identity. Others are rooted in their social identity. We found a number of major categories: rooted in ethnic identity only, rooted in ethnic identity but differentiating self from other groups, rooted in bicultural identity, rooted in national identity and confused ethnic and national identity. Significantly a number of participants were concerned to transcend group identities and described themselves as ‘not racist’ or ‘not prejudiced’. A model of ethnic and national identity is presented incorporating rootedness, differentiation, confusion and transcendence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The increase of migration and the presence of second generation immigrants are changing the configuration and the cultural composition of adolescents who attend the Aggregation Youth Centers' (AYC). In order to explore whether the AYC were represented as intercultural spaces, 26 adolescent immigrants (mean age = 15 years; M = 18, F = 8) were interviewed and 3 focus groups with their educators (N = 15; mean age = 32 years; M = 7, F = 8) were carried out in the AYCS of a Northern Italian province. The results of the Content Analysis showed many discrepancies in the representations of adolescents and adults. For example, for the adolescents, the AYC offers positive opportunities to experience a multicultural context: integrating in the host environment, experiencing the meanings of their own ethnicity and then sharing their own experiences with those who are living similar conditions of immigration. The educators represented this bicultural strategy, adopted by the adolescents, as a sign of ambiguity and lack of integration. They intended integration, in terms of assimilation to the host environment, indicating in this sense a failure of the integrative function of the AYCs.

Abstract = {Poor mental health among American Indian adolescents has been a matter of significant concern for the past two decades. This study extends the literature on acculturation within this population by investigating the relationship between hopelessness, levels of acculturation, and residence among American Indian adolescents. Utilizing data drawn from 438 adolescents across 67 American Indian tribes, our analyses show that American Indian adolescents who have bicultural competence (i.e., those who are adept in both Indian and White cultures) have significantly less hopelessness than do those with adeptness in only one culture or in neither culture. Our findings also show a significant difference by residence, with American Indians who live on reservations indicating less hopelessness than those living in urban or rural/nonreservation areas. Analysis of interaction effects suggests that the beneficial effect of adeptness in White culture is particularly true for American Indians living in urban areas.

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, undocumented settlement in the United States has grown to unprecedented numbers. Among the nearly 12 million undocumented immigrants, a substantial portion of undocumented youth is growing up with legal access to public education through high school but facing legal restrictions and economic barriers to higher education and the workforce. Every year, about 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high school nationwide. Like other children of immigrants, they plan to remain in the United States, but these young men and women have few means out of poverty. We provide a blueprint for assessing the future prospects of undocumented youth by offering a brief analysis of immigration and educational policies that currently affect the U.S. undocumented youth population and summarizing what is known about undocumented students' educational and occupational barriers and opportunities, particularly as they transition out of high school. We also discuss potential solutions to improve their circumstances and tap into their talents. Without broader means to obtain a postsecondary education and legally participate in adult life, these young men and women are a vulnerable population at risk for poverty and hardship. However, if given opportunities to pursue higher education and work legally in this country, these bilingual, bicultural students would benefit U.S. taxpayers and the economy overall.

Abstract = {The importance of identity is highlighted by the explosion of publications on the topic, in view of the cultural and ethnic challenges the United States is facing and the ongoing focus on how individuals assume identities based on group associations. This chapter explores the various theories of identity development relevant to deaf identities, including the disability-based framework, the social paradigm, racial identity development models, and acculturation models. Information is also presented on the relationships between deaf identity classifications (culturally Deaf, culturally hearing, bicultural, and marginal) and psychosocial adjustment. Additional categories that are explored include those covering the hard-of-hearing constellation, as well as the ethnic constellation. Technological influences on identity, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, and genetic technology, are also the subject of scrutiny. Issues pertaining to the complexities of biculturalism as based on the Deaf-hearing paradigm are examined, along with current influences that reinforce the concept of a multicultural identity as opposed to strict biculturalism. Current evidence suggests an increasingly fluid nature of identity, depending on environmental pull and individual characteristics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The oral/manual "methods" controversy arose more than 200 years ago. Although many variations exist, there have been three basic approaches. An "oral" approach concentrates on the development of the spoken language of a community. What is now known as a bilingual-bicultural (Bi-Bi) approach emphasizes the development of the natural sign language of a community as the first language, then teaches the majority language through reading. A third approach supports the development of a sign system based on the syntax of a spoken language and modifications of a sign language in instruction. This system can be used either alone or in coordination with speech, known as simultaneous communication (Sim Com), or alone. A fourth approach, known as total communication (TC), encourages the use of all forms of communication, dependent on individual needs. These longstanding debates have not been resolved after two centuries, and represent different perceptions of deafness, the requirements for leading a full, rich life, and resultant educational and social goals. The oral method was dominant from 1880 to 1960. Since then, constant change has occurred, with sign languages and sign systems receiving significant support. Recent global developments in neonatal screening, early intervention programs, cochlear implants, and the growth of an "inclusion" model in education have major implications for instruction and for the development of language and communication skills in deaf individuals.

Abstract = {Japan has long been a figure in the education drama spotlight. Educators from many other countries, particularly the United States have looked, often with awe and envy, at: what they thought was an "ideal" way to run an education system. However, there have been flaws in the research and it is obvious to anyone who spends a great deal of time studying Japanese education that while Japanese schools have great strengths, they also have glaring weaknesses. In my personal and professional life I have many non- Japanese friends and colleagues who are married and have children. When speaking with them, the conversation inevitably turns to education. "What are you going to do?" we ask, and the question elicits heavy sighs and headshaking. The answers are not easy. Most would like to send their child to an international school, from kindergarten through secondary school. Quite a number of these schools exist in major cities across the country. However, international schools are not cheap, and not always accessible, so in the end, many of my fellow expatriates send their kids to local elementary schools then leave the country before they would have to enter junior high. Although this is most certainly anecdotal, in my over two decades in Japan working with dozens of bicultural and transplanted people, I only know of two or three cases where expatriate parents willingly sent their offspring to local secondary schools or universities. It is those glaring weaknesses that cause my friends to return to their home countries and enroll their children there. The following chapter is a brief overview of the school system in Japan and an attempt to show recent transformations stemming from societal as well as administrational factors.

W. Berry;1980, 1992) based on theoretical work of M. M. Gordon (1964, 1978). Ss comprised distinct acculturated, bicultural and traditional groups, based on the 4 acculturation components of American structural, American cultural, Korean structural and Korean cultural. Results show that bicultural men were least likely to smoke, while acculturated and bicultural women were more likely to smoke than traditional women. Higher acculturation was related to light physical activity, but not to vigorous physical activity. Fat intake did not differ according to acculturation status. Higher acculturation was associated with higher body mass index and better self-reported health in men. Findings suggest that among Korean Americans, acculturation components vary in their relationships with health, beneficial health effects of being bicultural are found only for smoking status of men, and acculturation–health relationships are multidimensional.

Abstract = {The authors propose that culture affects people through their perceptions of what is consensually believed. Whereas past research has examined whether cultural differences in social judgment are mediated by differences in individuals’ personal values and beliefs, this article investigates whether they are mediated by differences in individuals’ perceptions of the views of people around them. The authors propose that individuals who perceive that traditional views are culturally consensual (e.g., Chinese participants who believe that most of their fellows hold collectivistic values) will themselves behave and think in culturally typical ways. Four studies of previously well-established cultural differences found that cultural differences were mediated by participants’ perceived consensus as much as by participants’ personal views. This held true for cultural differences in the bases of compliance (Study 1), attributional foci (Study 2), and counterfactual thinking styles (Study 3). To tease apart the effect of consensus perception from other possibly associated individual differences, in Study 4, the authors experimentally manipulated which of 2 cultures was salient to bicultural participants and found that judgments were guided by participants’ perception of the consensual view of the salient culture.

Weaving together themes of Chinese and Western mythology, bicultural identity, and common immigrant experiences of loss, guilt, and shame, Chin unveils the pain and transformation of immigration through her eyes and those of her mother, Fung Gor Lee. Overall, the author eloquently integrates personal experience and educational teachings into a powerful memoir that takes the reader into the household of Jean Lau Chin. Through her recounting of the struggle of intergenerational conflict and parent-child misunderstandings, shame is openly discussed in the context of immigration and ethnic identity transformation. The discussion of the progression from shame and misunderstanding of one's Chinese values, to respect and admiration, is particularly effective in demonstrating this process of transformation.

Abstract = {Discusses the methodological challenges in longitudinal tracking and interviewing a bicultural high-risk population for outreach program evaluations. Recognizing the diversity of the target client population, a culturally sensitive approach to tracking and interviewing Hispanic clients was developed, which includes: (1) locating a bilingual/bicultural research interviewer; (2) translating the questionnaire into Spanish; (3) conducting the interviews in Spanish when preferred by the client; (4) identifying effective incentives for participants; (5) and tracking clients in a culturally-sensitive manner. The approach taken to maintain the methodological rigor of the evaluation is also described. This approach includes: (1) maintaining the objectivity of the interviewer; (2) maintaining the independence of the research interviewer from job roles of program staff; (3) and protecting client confidentiality. The low participation rate of a 3-mo interview involving 158 participants (mean age 37 yrs) and 201 non-participants (mean age 33 yrs) is addressed. The problems associated with tracking and following-up with this high risk client group are discussed, as well as the outcomes of such efforts.

The presence of indigenous researchers as full and equal members of the research team can guard against an unexamined exportation of ideas and methods developed in one culture to other cultural/linguistic communities. The team develops the research plan and a research protocol that express a given concept with equal clarity, affect, and level of usage simultaneously in two languages. The dual-focus method employs a concept-driven rather than a translation-driven approach to attain conceptual and linguistic equivalence.

This chapter explores how Indian-American women in their 20s and 30s are weaving conflicting marital traditions into a new pattern, one they can live with. Their responses are compared to other ethnic immigrant groups, with an emphasis on other Asian communities, to situate their experiences. Although their research resulted in a plethora of information for both sexes, this chapter focuses on the process that Indian-American women are undergoing as they negotiate a bicultural identity. These women compare and contrast the gender roles they have observed in their parental homes with their expectations of their own relationships. They state their opinion regarding dating criteria and parentally arranged vs self-arranged marriages and the taboo subject of divorce which is still an uncomfortable issue for this community.

Abstract = {Alita was a 27-yr-old Native American woman undergraduate student of mixed tribe ancestries who was self-referred to her university counseling center. For a portion of her life, Alita lived with Caucasian foster parents. She displayed identity confusion and a lack of self-confidence in relation to personal, bicultural, and academic issues. These guided the development and implementation of her treatment plan. After exploring Alita's belief and cultural traditions, it was determined that she felt comfortable with an integrated relational, cognitive-behavioral, psychoeducational, Native healing approach. The approach was free from an emphasis on diagnosis and pathology was emphasized. Alita was given information about depression, alcoholism, and meditation. She participated in cultural strengthening, which involved participation in the talking circle and sweats, cultural forums for attending to spiritual needs. Through these forums she found support for her spiritual needs as well as her Indian identity. Alita's fears about her drinking were addressed effectively with appropriate referrals to support groups in her community. The deferral of diagnosis for a while allowed other aspects of the intervention to take effect until Alita could make healthier choices about her drinking.

The authors compare the cueing of English and the signing of MCE systems in terms of theoretical and practical advantages.

These services focused on deaf adults (mentors), who made regular home visits to the children and their families; shared their language (American Sign Language), culture, and personal knowledge of deafness with the families; and served as role models for the children. The children also received regular home visits from a hearing parent adviser who helped the family promote the child's early listening, English, and literacy skills. The result was a bilingual-bicultural home environment for these children. The 18 children (mean age 27.2 mo) who received deaf mentor services were compared with 18 matched children (mean age 28.6 mo) who did not receive these services but who received parent adviser services. Children receiving this early bilingual-bicultural programming made greater language gains during treatment time, had considerably larger vocabularies, and scored higher on measures of communication, language, and English syntax than the matched children.

As the title suggests, this book illustrates a form of qualitative research called ‘‘lifewriting.’’ The demonstration of this style of writing/research combines three lives, as told in three different ways: (a) her own partial autobiography, an autoethnography developed according to certain interests she wishes to explore; (b) a biography of her mother, which is based on her mother’s storytelling and retelling over many years; and (c) an imaginary biography, in which she compiles a story of her father’s life from fragmentary pieces of information, photographs, and remembrances from her familial past. This book is a highly sophisticated compilation of issues vibrant in the feminist, postmodern, and minority group cultures regarding voice, representation, and reflexivity. The challenges it raises with regard to multicultural and bicultural issues are unsettling, but worthy of consideration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The results strongly support the concept that ethnic identity and acculturation are related but separate processes. Ethnic identity scores were found to be highest in 1st generation, less acculturated Ss, and traditional acculturative types. Higher levels of acculturation were associated with less feelings of affirmation and belonging, and less feelings of ethnic identity achievement. High bicultural Ss were found to obtain higher scores in ethnic identity than low bicultural Ss, and high bicultural Ss were found to be oriented more toward others than those Ss who were classified as traditional or assimilated. Findings suggest that one's sense of ethnic group membership diminishes with behavioral acculturation among Mexican Americans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Because tribal and familial diversity reflect the varying levels of acculturation to the non-Indian world, American Indian communities have become bicultural. In the context of disability, this bicultural world also is influenced by other factors including (1) the social construct of disability (within and outside native cultures), (2) the stigma associated with certain disabilities within the majority society and how this stigma influences public policies and practices that affect native communities, and (3) the apparent priority given to disability within Indian communities. This article examines the interplay of some of these complex forces. Specific topics discussed in the context of American Indians include the social construct of disability, the bicultural world, the historical perspective of disabilities, availability of services, lack of data about disabilities, and special education programs.

Anxiety scores (modified Spanish version of the State Anxiety Scale, C. D. Spielberger, 1976) constituted the criterion for level of adjustment. Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analyses revealed that biculturalism and anxiety are related to Ss' length of time in the US, younger people are more inclined to be bicultural, there is a significant, positive linear relationship, between biculturalism and anxiety scores, and support groups, educational level, family income and ethnic identification are significantly associated with biculturalism. In contrast, there were no gender differences on levels of anxiety or degree of biculturalism, no significant relationship between age and anxiety; and no age by gender interaction.

Hall raised a number of significant issues in the education of Deaf students, and called for greater recognition of bilingual/bicultural educational programs which take into account cultural factors relevant to the Deaf community, and which utilise native sign languages in programs aimed at developing language proficiency. Hall discussed the importance of effective written language skills for Deaf people if they are to function in the wider community, skills which have not been well developed in the past, as she calls for new approaches to teaching written language to Deaf children. The authors of this article, while supporting the views of Hall, do not believe she takes sufficient account of the difficulties associated with affording both English and native sign languages equal prominence in a classroom, nor does she recognise the importance of beginning instruction in English before the secondary school years. This paper develops further some of the notions put forward by Hall, and highlights current efforts to implement culturally sympathetic programs for young Deaf children, with particular reference to the Thomas Pattison School in New South Wales, Australia.

Abstract = {Examined the role of acculturation, caregiver burden, and family support in predicting depression in Hispanic women caring for a relative with significant cognitive impairment. 42 caregivers (aged 32–69 yrs) participated in extensive interviews as part of a home visit. Two measures of burden, perceived impact of caregiving on the health of the caregiver and dissatisfaction with family support with caregiving, both predicted depression, while level of acculturation and years in the US did not. Further breakdowns revealed that perceived impact of caregiving on health was significantly related to depression in both more traditional and more bicultural groups of caregivers. However, dissatisfaction with family support was significantly correlated with depression among more bicultural caregivers but not among more traditional caregivers.

Narratives about Armenian and non-Armenian cultural activities, and attitudes toward language usage and culture were elicited from 44 boys and girls aged 8–15 yrs. Some of the children spoke Armenian in addition to English, but all were active in an Armenian American community. American-born bilingual children were found to use relatively more first-person plural pronouns than singular pronouns in stories about Armenian cultural activities compared with English-only speaking children of Armenian descent and foreign-born bilingual children, suggesting that American-born bilingual children may have closer affinity with the Armenian American community than either monolingual or foreign-born bilingual children. Differences between the groups in attitude toward bicultural background also were found. Monolinguals made relatively fewer positive evaluations of their bicultural experiences than either the American-born or foreign-born bilingual children.

Abstract = {Reviews different ways that culture has been used in developing the notion of culturally competent mental health services and provides an enhanced definition of culture through a critical review of these ideas. The authors discuss different dimensions of culture that emerge as important issues in the development of bilingual/bicultural psychiatric programs. Specific topics discussed include culture as language, as ethnic identity, as material signs, as events and celebrations, and as shared values; culture and views of mental illness, and acculturation; and the role of social factors in structuring subcultures. A multifaceted definition of the influences of culture on the assessment of clients in culturally competent mental health programs is provided. The issues raised in this review are illustrated with case examples from an evaluation of 3 inpatient bilingual/bicultural psychiatric programs created in a metropolitan area to provide services to severely mentally ill Hispanics. The authors note that in the development of culturally competent mental health services, program planners need to move beyond a simplistic view of culture as creating a physical atmosphere and hiring people who speak the language to incorporate in a more detailed way the multiple dimensions of culture.

Abstract = {Examined ethnic self-identification and ethnic attitudes and behaviour in 245 indigenous Sami adolescents (aged 12–17 yrs) in northern Norway. Results from a self-report questionnaire showed that ethnic identity was strongly related to both parentage and type of ethnic community. Monoethnic Ss at the coast (with great integration and assimilation) identified mostly as bicultural or Norwegian, but in the highland (with strong ethnic support), they identified strongly as Samis. Ss with mixed parentage identified strongly as Norwegian at the coast, but mostly as bicultural in the highland. Ethnic behaviour and attitudes were significantly associated with both family and regional context, and ethnic self-identification was related to components such as attitudes toward language and ethnic paraphernalia. The authors discuss the importance of community support in indigenous cultures to encourage adolescent attachment to ethnic groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The selected instruments for acculturation evaluation are described in sufficient detail to suggest their usefulness for assessment practice. The measures described are the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans, the Cultural Life Style Inventory, the Bicultural/Multicultural Experience Inventory, the Measure of Acculturation, and the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire which was developed for Cuban Americans. Cultural identity information facilitates selection of standard psychological tests or culture-specific instruments. Such information also informs clinical diagnosis, personality description, therapeutic assessment, and psychotherapy.

Abstract = {Proposes that a better understanding of home country privilege, and of the pervasiveness of ethnocentric world views when working abroad or with others who are somehow "different," may impede one's probability of adjustment and subsequently of success. It is suggested that interventions and training programs geared toward improving the success rates of intercultural relationships should rely less on models that reinforce ethnocentricity and attend more to developing bicultural and multicultural identities in potential sojourners. The ethnic identity literature is reviewed in order to understand how a bi- or even multi-cultural identity may develop. Furthermore, it is suggested that tools for coping and succeeding in novel cultures may be revealed by examining the bicultural life experiences and strategies used by minority group members within the American cultural context.

There were clear differences between native and nonnative inmates on both the MCMI-II and the Rorschach. When the participants were separated into bicultural, assimilated, and traditional groups, the bicultural group had the most difficulties in coping and in interpersonal relationships. Results suggest that the profile for offenders is not the same for Alaska natives and nonnatives.

Harkness and Ch. M. Super's (1993) framework of the developmental niche, illustrated with examples from research on ethnic minorities in the Netherlands. These examples show that parents initially try to rearrange settings in accordance with their belief systems rather than change their belief systems. The acculturation process is explored in the case of the Hindustanis who migrated from India to Surinam about a century ago and then to the Netherlands in the 1970s. This case shows that the interaction between public and private domains may have different outcomes, depending on the economic and power structures of society, the attitude of the culture groups in contact, their numerical strength, their daily life setting, and the social cohesion of ethnic communities.

Audiotapes and videotapes were made of conversations between Japanese and Americans who work together at 3 firms in Tokyo. Transcriptions of the data were used to help locate misinterpretations that can arise from differing assumptions about the communicative task of giving instructions. Further, evidence was provided for how co-workers create rapport despite cultural differences. Some of these group-bonding strategies were joking and teasing, cooperative complaining, conversations in a form of mixed English and Japanese ("code switching"), and producing talk that has an echoing effect. Findings suggest that a context-sensitive, interactional approach to situated talk will enable people to locate pragmatic misunderstandings and other important communicative phenomena that other methods will fail to identify.

Abstract = {Explored the relationship between cultural difference and individual achieving styles among 20 male and 10 female Asian American bilingual/bicultural psychotherapists and 16 male and 14 female non-Asian American therapists, based on the Achieving Styles Inventory (ASI). There was limited support for a difference in the achieving styles between the 2 groups. Male Ss in both groups scored significantly higher in competitive-direct and self-instrumental achieving styles. Age was an important factor only in the bilingual/bicultural group, where older Asian American Ss scored significantly higher in the vicarious and contributory relational achieving styles. Level of education yielded a higher score difference among female Ss, and a higher score difference among Asian American Ss. Asian American females with higher education achieved the highest total score. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

This article reviews the literature on the psychological impact of being bicultural. Assimilation, acculturation, alternation, multicultural, and fusion models that have been used to describe the psychological processes, social experiences, and individual challenges and obstacles of being bicultural are reviewed and summarized for their contributions and implications for investigations of the psychological impact of biculturalism. Emphasis is given to the alternation model, which posits that an individual is able to gain competence within 2 cultures without losing his or her cultural identity or having to choose one culture over the other. Finally, a hypothetical model outlining the dimensions of bicultural competence is presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The support for Bi-Bi education is based on linguistic analysis of American Sign Language (ASL) and from dissatisfaction with manually coded English (MCE) systems currently in use. After a review of classroom signing over the past 20 yrs and a discussion of the effects of English-based signing, this article concludes that researchers are still not certain whether incorporating ASL features into English-based signing would meet the conditions of comprehensible linguistic input. While Bi-Bi represents a significant breakthrough in deaf education, it should not strive to use only ASL, but should use ASL and English-based signing, such as MCE, as complementary communication tools.

Abstract = {It has been argued that the Mexican-American's relinquishment of traditional values lessens acculturative stress and associated adjustment problems (the melting pot hypothesis). The bicultural hypothesis supposes that identification with the Anglo-American culture, while at the same time maintaining traditional values, facilitates healthier psychosocial adjustment. 259 Mexican-American (MA) adults residing in southern California responded to a standardized measure of psychological impairment to test these hypotheses. Data indicate that neither the melting pot nor the bicultural hypotheses were directly supported. Spanish-speaking MAs reported significantly fewer problems of social relations but more anxiety problems than did more acculturated MAs (both Engligh-speaking and bilinguals). Consistent with this pattern, 1st generation MAs expressed significantly fewer problems of psychosocial dysfunction than did the 3rd generation. Depressive symptoms were not significantly related to level of acculturation. When sociodemographic characteristics were held constant, only differences in psychosocial dysfunction symptoms persisted. Differences in anxiety symptoms between the groups are best explained by SES. It is suggested that differences in problems of social relations reflect a cultural difference in the expression or the acceptance of psychosocially dysfunctional behaviors and the stress that accompanies acculturation.

Abstract = {This study examines the process of linguistic-and-cultural-identity formation as experienced by adult immigrants to Canada who consider themselves professionally successful and highly proficient in the target language. It addresses the characteristics of “good language learners” by determining how they negotiated their marginal standing in Canadian society and became successful professionals, proficient in English. It offers insights into the role of human agency in good language learning, and it analyzes the dynamics between identity and internal versus external power. Through a series of interviews with 20 practicing professionals who immigrated as adults, 3 common strategies emerged as essential in their journey of identity construction: generation of a self-motivating inner dialogue as a counter-discourse to the social marginalization paradigm expected by the native speaker (NS) community, finding ways to gain access into the social networks of native speakers in order to improve communicative competence and secure meaningful employment, and symbolic membership in an “imagined community” of successful multilingual and bicultural adult immigrants.

In order to obtain relevant information, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 Cypriot hearing adults with Deaf parents between the ages of 21 and 30 years with different occupation, sex, and educational background. It was found that most of the participants developed a bicultural identity, undertook the interpreter and protector role in their family, and interacted well with their parents, despite the lack of in-depth communication that they noted. The positive role of the extended family was acknowledged. The prejudices of Cypriot hearing people against the Deaf people were identified, as well as the lack of state support toward the Deaf community.

Abstract = {Although seminal reviews have been published on acculturation and mental health in adults and adolescents, far less is known about how acculturation influences adolescent interpersonal and self-directed violence. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review of research linking acculturation and violence behavior for adolescents of three minority populations: Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI), and American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN). The preponderance of evidence from studies on Latino and A/PI youth indicate that higher levels of adolescent assimilation (i.e., measured by time in the United States, English language use, U.S. cultural involvement, or individualism scales) were a risk factor for youth violence. Ethnic group identity or culture-of-origin involvement appear to be cultural assets against youth violence with supporting evidence from studies on A/PI youth; however, more studies are needed on Latino and AI/AN youth. Although some evidence shows low acculturation or cultural marginality to be a risk factor for higher levels of fear, victimization, and being bullied, low acculturation also serves as a protective factor against dating violence victimization for Latino youth. An important emerging trend in both the Latino and, to a lesser extent, A/PI youth literature shows that the impact of acculturation processes on youth aggression and violence can be mediated by family dynamics. The literature on acculturation and self-directed violence is extremely limited and has conflicting results across the examined groups, with high acculturation being a risk factor for Latinos, low acculturation being a risk factor of A/PI youth, and acculturation-related variables being unrelated to suicidal behavior among AI/AN youth. Bicultural skills training as a youth violence and suicide prevention practice is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The process offers practitioners an opportunity to enrich their understanding of the diverse idioms of distress, cultural constructions and explanatory health beliefs. Aims: This paper draws upon the literature and clinical accounts to provide a set of positive practice guidelines on working with interpreters in mental health. Method: Key indicator words for the literature review were "interpreters and mental health" and "language and mental health". Papers that related purely to linguistic theory, cultural theory, or sign language interpreting were not included. To assist with triangulation of the data the authors also drew upon accounts of support and supervision groups for interpreters and bicultural workers, expert panels on the topic, training programs and published guidelines for interpreters and clinicians. Results and Conclusions: Mental health services around the world need to be accessible, inclusive, appropriate and accord with best practice and national legislation.

Abstract = {Theories of acculturation predict that discrepancies in cultural orientation between adolescents and their parents will increase the adolescents’ risk for behavior problems such as substance use. This study evaluated this hypothesis in a sample of 1772 Hispanic 9th grade students in Southern California. Parent–child discrepancy in U.S. orientation (defined as the difference between the child’s U.S. orientation and the child’s perception of the parents’ U.S. orientation) was a risk factor for past-month smoking, lifetime and past-month alcohol use, and lifetime and past-month marijuana use. Parent–child discrepancy in Hispanic orientation (defined as the difference between the child’s Hispanic orientation and the child’s perception of the parents’ Hispanic orientation) was a risk factor for lifetime and past-month alcohol and marijuana use. The adolescents’ own Hispanic orientation was protective against lifetime and past-month smoking and marijuana use, but not alcohol use. In an analysis of mediation, U.S. acculturation discrepancy was associated with lower levels of family cohesion, which in turn was associated with higher levels of substance use. Results suggest that family-based interventions for acculturating and bicultural Hispanic families may be useful in decreasing the likelihood of substance use among Hispanic adolescents.

Design a n d Methods: In 2007, 33 Mexican American older adults (9 men and 24 women) were recruited by promotoras (community health workers) from clusters of colonias in Hidalgo County to participate in focus group discussions conducted in Spanish. After participants completed a 19-item questionnaire (in Spanish), a bilingual and bicultural researcher from the community, trained as a moderator, conducted 4 focus groups using a semistructured interview guide, culturally modified with the assistance of promotoras. All discussions were audio recorded; audio recordings were transcribed verbatim in Spanish and then translated into English. Analyses were conducted in English. Results: Almost 85% had less than a high school education and 100% reported a household income less than $20,000/year. Groups attached cultural meaning to aging well. The idea of "staying straight in the mind" resonated as a depiction of brain health. Participants also mentioned the types of activities they could do to stay "right in the mind." Implications: Particular attention must be focused on development of programs that provide satisfying culturally appropriate activities for older participants and the delivery of health messages that take into consideration culture and language.

Abstract = {This research focuses on patterns of English proficiency and use-of-English among older immigrants living in linguistically concentrated, ethnic neighborhoods. A sample (n = 60) of older Puerto Ricans, who moved from the island to the mainland in their twenties, were divided into English proficiency groups (fluent, high intermediate, low intermediate) via the Adult Language Assessment Scales. Participants then provided self ratings of their English proficiency (understanding, speaking, reading, and writing), their use of English in social domains (language spoken with own-family, in-laws, spouse, children, neighbors, and workmates), and their use of English in private psychological domains (language of talking to oneself, counting, writing notes to oneself, thinking, dreaming, praying, and expressing feelings). Finally, all participants completed the Puerto Rican Bicultural Scale. Results show a cohort of immigrant elders whose first language is protected by their ethnic neighborhoods but whose domestic and private lives are increasingly permeated by English. In particular, children emerge as powerful forces of language socialization in English for their parents. Further, there are important individual differences by level of proficiency, with a lowest proficiency group that is less acculturated, lower in socioeconomic status, and even more linguistically isolated than groups with higher proficiency. In essence, level of second language proficiency is a potent source of intracultural variation. Methodologically, the paper makes the important point that self-rated patterns of language use are consistent with scores on formal measures of proficiency. The paper also provides empirical verification of the logic of dividing language use into external, social speech and internal, psychological speech.

Abstract = {Cummins calls on educators to promote critical dialog during micro-interactions with students, times when students acquire knowledge and negotiate their identities. For critical dialog to flourish, educators must create caring environments. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether a discourse of caring was transmitted to ethnic Kurdish students enrolled in a bilingual/bicultural education program in Denmark, and the mitigating role that macro (societal) factors, such as a discourse of fear played in their educators’ attempts to create safe, caring havens for critical dialog. To do so, I deconstruct issues that arose when an educator taught a novel study unit as a springboard for developing critical literacy. I adopted a critical ethnographic case-study approach that featured interviews, extensive participant-observation, and document analysis. There were mixed results with more at issue than pedagogical and linguistic factors. Macro-level discourses mitigated the success of the intervention, as did identity issues related to ethnic solidarity; however, some pedagogical features of the program opened up spaces for the ethnic Kurdish children to critically examine fear of ‘difference.’ (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reports on the introduction of an experimental Navajo bilingual-bicultural curriculum emphasizing open-ended questioning, inductive/analytical reasoning, and student verbalization in both small- and large-group settings. The critical elements influencing students' and teachers' positive response to this curriculum are examined as they relate to natural learning–teaching interactions outside the classroom, and to an articulated Navajo philosophy of knowledge. Findings challenge conventional characterizations of holistic/analytical and verbal/nonverbal teaching and learning styles which, when applied to educational practice, can perpetuate patterns of learned dependence that extend well beyond the classroom to the reproduction of structural relations within the wider society.

The American Indian participants completed some additional items regarding their ethnic beliefs and their perceptions of their parents' cultural beliefs and practices. American Indian students placed greater value on the instrumental importance of education, more strongly affirmed their ethnic identity, and felt closer to their ethnic group than did European American students. For American Indian students, perceptions of mother's socialization of cultural beliefs and practices were strongly related to students' ratings of ethnic identity achievement, ethnic practices and belonging, and importance of ethnic identity. Belief in one's bicultural efficacy was positively correlated with American Indian students' ratings of academic identity and belief in the instrumental importance of school.

It examines the various discourses and practices that inform and shape the experiences and identities of urban, Lao American high school students.

It shows that youth are creating incomplete, contradictory—ambivalent—urban, immigrant identities and are changing what it means to be ‘urban’ and ‘immigrant’ youth. By highlighting the ambivalent nature of immigrant identities, this article complicates binary notions of urban, immigrant identities as good/bad and unsettles the ancestral country/United States oppositional framing of the experiences of immigrant students.

Abstract = {Portuguese immigrants to North America represent a large ethnic group with unique family therapy needs. The present study investigates acculturation and the family lives of Portuguese (Azorean) immigrants in Canada. Methods of analytic induction and constant comparison from grounded theory were used to examine transcripts of interviews with 21 Azorean immigrant women and 28 Azorean immigrant men. A model emerged wherein (a) immigration and acculturation act as stressors on the family unit, as described by the categories Process of Change and Family Relationships; (b) family members adopt generation- and gender-specific acculturative strategies, as illustrated by the categories Duas Culturas (Two Cultures) and Falando Portuges (Speaking Portuguese); and (c) as family members acculturate, discords arise and are resolved according to the cultural traits different members have adopted. The categories Discord Resolution and Preocupação (Preoccupations) illustrate this last dynamic. Implications for family therapy with immigrant families include an indication for community-level interventions, emphasis on confidentiality, awareness of acculturation stress and different acculturative strategies within the family, and aiding the family in the negotiation and integration of a new bicultural reality.

Abstract = {This article examines how multiracial individuals negotiate their different and sometimes conflicting racial identities. Drawing from previous work on bicultural identity integration (see Benet-Martínez & Haritatos, 2005), we proposed a new construct, multiracial identity integration (MII), to measure individual differences in perceptions of compatibility between multiple racial identities. We found that MII is composed of two independent subscales: racial distance that describes whether different racial identities are perceived as disparate, and racial conflict that describes whether different racial identities are perceived as in conflict. We also found that recalling positive multiracial experiences increased MII, while recalling negative multiracial experiences decreased MII. These findings have implications for understanding the psychological well-being of multiracial individuals, and the development of social policy and programs catered to this population.

Abstract = {Four broad objectives are outlined which would ensure inclusivity and adequate support for emergent bilinguals in mainstream classes. Ideally, children should feel that their first language makes a contribution to the classroom, they should have frequent opportunities to interact with the teacher, and equally important, with their peers, and they should feel that the general objective of the classes is to make them bilingual and bicultural. In search of what might be considered good practice, the present article presents 'snapshots' of five teaching scenarios in mainstream schools with support for English as an additional language (EAL) in the UK, using observer field notes, pupils' diaries and interviews to describe the experiences of the pupils. While the study finds some approaches in the mainstream classroom to be problematic, and is sometimes critical of them even when they have EAL support, the examples of small group teaching that are presented suggest that strategies that provide focused support for new arrivals in a separate EAL class have their merit, and do not run counter to the principle of inclusion, although the ideal of inclusivity is a long way from being achieved.

The two boys and two girls were born and raised in Canada, speaking English at school and with their siblings, and Cantonese at home with their parents. A total of 67 pieces of school writing and 54 pieces of home writing were collected over a five-week period. Findings show that home writing exhibit a wider range of functions and genres than school writing.

The chapter is organized in four sections. First, a mindful approach to intercultural-intimate relationship conflicts will serve as a starting point for discussion. Second, the value dimension of individualism-collectivism and its impact on intimate relationship expectations will be examined. Third, the importance of understanding a partner's cultural/ethnic identity development stage will be addressed.

We will argue that biculturalism offers two elements that can benefit organizations: adaptability and boundary spanning. Adaptability is the ability to shift one's actions to the demands of a particular cultural audience, and boundary spanning is the ability to serve as a conduit between cultural groups. The first quality affects individual interactions with others. The second quality affects the network structures of organizations. Further, we discuss how bicultural people's adaptability and boundary spanning benefit managerial activities, including teams, decision making, leadership, and dispute resolution. We are also aware that the benefits of biculturalism are not unconditional. We also will discuss the boundary conditions and potential negative sides of biculturalism.

Abstract = {An earlier version of this chapter appeared in New Zealand Journal of History 38, I (2004): 22-38. Writing in her conference diary in 1934, Elsie Andrews noted that the Pan-Pacific Women's Association (PPWA) had celebrated its New Zealand delegation as example to the world. As leader of the delegation, Andrews reported with evident pride that the hit of the Honolulu conference had been the bilingual and bicultural presentation by Maori and pakeha delegates. Their performance had been considered to encapsulate the very kind of harmonious and cooperative race relations that, it was hoped, would facilitate a just and humane future relationship for the peoples of the world. This chapter focuses on Andrews's efforts—through her part in the performance—to constitute herself as a modern settler colonial. Through her account of sharing the international stage with Maori women delegates, particularly with Victoria Bennett, Andrews sought to explain her status as a cosmopolitan and progressive woman of the world. As the introduction to this collection points out, it is in studying affective relations that we locate interconnections between local and long-distance exchanges of empire and colonialism, both within space and time and through the intimacies exchanged therein between embodied subjects. With an international conference in the 1930's as its spatial location, this chapter investigates an account of the interchanges between not one but multiple locals and the larger networks of imperial power, and their supposed transcendence through the formation of an international community of women. Andrews's investment in these exchanges was considerable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Contemporary New Zealand (NZ) is a dynamic society, with a diverse population and a broad cultural mix. An appreciation of crucial aspects of NZ history and culture will help to facilitate an understanding of our discussion of the range and nature of psychotherapeutic interventions for psychosis provided to clients of mental health services. Aotearoa/New Zealand was formally established with the signing in 1840 of the Treaty of Waitangi (TOW), a document endorsed by the British Crown and most of the Maori chiefs of the time. This treaty delineates the nature of the relationship between the two parties, Pakeha (those of European descent) and Maori, and recognises the rights of the indigenous people of NZ. The treaty remains an important 'live' document today, expressing a commitment to uphold its spirit in service delivery, including mental health services, which are bicultural in nature, catering to the needs of both Maori and Pakeha (Kawharu, 1989). In common with other Western countries, NZ mental health services have changed in response to the growing influence of the consumer movement, now well established in NZ in all levels of mental health service planning, with the demand that services are more responsive to the needs of consumers. Other factors which have influenced the range of services offered to psychotic clients include the development of early intervention services (EISs), loosely following the model of the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) in Melbourne (see Gleeson and McGorry, 2004), and the more general impact of the growing body of literature which demonstrates the importance and value of psychotherapeutic interventions for psychosis. In addition to these broad Western influences on mental health services, within NZ there has also been the unique impact of the policy of 'biculturalism', which outlines the rights of Maori to receive services which are sensitive to and concordant with Maori cultural values. In accordance with the Treaty of Waitingi, NZ public mental health services include 'mainstream' services and Kaupapa Maori services. The sections of this chapter address the following topics: Maori mental health; Mainstream services; Early intervention services; Groups; Residential options; Recovery through meaningful occupation; Research; and National support and development structures. These national and local initiatives both reflect and create a great energy and commitment within NZ to clinical approaches to psychoses, including but not limited to psychotherapeutic approaches. Indeed, they provide a platform for debate and discussion regarding the various understandings of and interventions for psychoses, and involve contributions from clients and a broad range of clinicians, with various cultural perspectives (Maori, Pacific Island and Pakeha) represented. We conclude that while not free of difficulties or tensions, psychotherapeutic interventions for psychoses are in reasonably good health in NZ. There is increasing recognition of the value of such interventions and opportunities for working in innovative ways are encouraged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Exposure to obesogenic environments in the U.S. may foster development of overweight in immigrants with greater acculturation. Few studies document mechanisms of the acculturation process from immigrants’ own perspectives or describe implications on the children of immigrants. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted with immigrant Latina mothers (N = 51) examining mothers’ beliefs, attitudes and practices related to early child feeding and weight. Focus group participants completing the Marin Acculturation Scale more closely identified with Latino culture, although the mean score (2.04, SD = 0.59) was close to "bicultural". Analysis revealed seven themes when mothers compared lifestyles between their native countries and the U.S., related to changes in (1) diet, perceived food quality and availability, (2) food and eating practices, (3) breastfeeding practices, (4) beliefs about food, child feeding and weight status, (5) weight status of mothers and children, (6) physical activity and sedentary lifestyles, and (7) social isolation and support.

Abstract = {Informal observations in Australian refuge/shelter services suggest that culturally and linguistically diverse women and children are over-represented in crisis rather than early intervention services. This observation includes Vietnamese women and children escaping intimate partner violence (IPV). There is limited research on the prevalence or characteristics of IPV in Vietnam or their diaspora that sheds light on the role played by immigration, acculturation, gender roles and other factors affecting Vietnamese victims' help-seeking strategies. Such knowledge can inform innovative responses to reduce IPV among Vietnamese families. We searched electronic databases and websites using keyword terms for 'intimate partner/family violence' and 'Viet'*. The review found that Vietnamese victims and perpetrators of IPV share major similarities with those globally, especially the socio-economic determinants and sequelae of IPV. However, immigration and refugee status confer particular stressors. The review highlights the important bridging role of bilingual and bicultural staff and other emerging and promising directions.

Abstract = {The authors examined the extent to which Berry's (1997) acculturation orientation categories--assimilation, integration, separation, and marginalization--would emerge from a latent class analysis of continuous acculturation indices. Hispanic college students (N = 436) from Miami participated in the study. The authors used measures of heritage and American cultural orientations to create the latent classes. The authors utilized a number of external variables, including ethnic identity, value-based indices of cultural identity, familial ethnic socialization, acculturative stress, and perceived ethnic discrimination to validate the cluster solution. Overall, our findings provided mixed support for Berry's model. Six latent classes emerged from analysis. Two of these appeared to represent variants of biculturalism, two resembled a combination of assimilation and biculturalism, one resembled a combination of separation and biculturalism, and one was not clearly associated with any of Berry's categories. The two bicultural classes differed markedly in American and heritage cultural orientations, ethnic identity, and nearly all of the value-based indices of cultural identity. Some of the differences among the six classes supported Berry's model, and others did not. The authors discuss the implications of these results for acculturation theory and research.

Abstract = {A robust relationship between perceived racial discrimination and psychological distress has been established. Yet, mixed evidence exists regarding the extent to which ethnic identification moderates this relationship, and scarce attention has been paid to the moderating role of national identification. We propose that the role of group identifications in the perceived discrimination–psychological distress relationship is best understood by simultaneously and interactively considering ethnic and national identifications. A sample of 259 Asian American students completed measures of perceived discrimination, group identifications (specific ethnic identification stated by respondents and national or “mainstream American” identification), and psychological distress (anxiety and depression symptoms). Regression analyses revealed a significant three-way interaction of perceived discrimination, ethnic identification, and national identification on psychological distress. Simple-slope analyses indicated that dual identification (strong ethnic and national identifications) was linked to a weaker relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological distress compared with other group identification configurations. These findings underscore the need to consider the interconnections between ethnic and national identifications to better understand the circumstances under which group identifications are likely to buffer individuals against the adverse effects of racial discrimination.

Abstract = {Recent developments indicate that Aboriginal teachers who are culturally sensitive to their epistemologies will have an increasing role in sustaining Aboriginal language and cultures while promoting self determination among Aboriginal students. This research will inform educational decision-makers both in reserve schools and in the mainstream to address the needs of new Aboriginal teachers and to consider how to support them during their professional induction. This research gives explicit attention to the voices of new Aboriginal teachers across Ontario. The participants represented a cross-section of teachers from across the province. Each participant had between one and three years of experience. A bicultural research team coded transcripts to identify key themes across participants' experiences. There is a genuine need to understand the experiences of Aboriginal educators as expressed in their own words in safe environments. This bi-epistemic and collaborative research project endeavors to recognize the circumstances of new Aboriginal teachers, their formal teacher preparation, and the extent to which resources are allocated to support them in their beginning years by honoring their voices in a research methodology that is harmonious with their traditions. Simultaneously, it seeks to embed knowledge itself within the spirit of the interrelated and interconnected realities of who we are and who we are becoming as a team of researchers and as peoples.

Abstract = {Recent commentary has advocated for epidemiological investigation as a foundational science for understanding disparities in the delivery of mental health care and for the development of early trauma-focused interventions. Few acute care investigations have examined the diversity of ethnic/racial heritages or compared variations in early posttraumatic distress in representative samples of injured trauma survivors. Hospitalized injury survivors at two United States level I trauma centers were randomly approached in order to document linguistic and ethnic/racial diversity. Approximately 12% of patients approached were non-English speaking with 16 languages represented. English speaking, inpatients were screened for posttraumatic stress disorder, peritraumatic dissociative, and depressive symptoms. For 269 English speaking study participants, ethnic/racial group status was clearly categorized into one group for 72%, two groups for 25%, and three groups for 3% of participants. Regression analyses that adjusted for relevant clinical and demographic characteristics revealed that relative to whites, patients from American Indian, African American, Hispanic, and Asian heritages demonstrated significant elevations in one or more posttraumatic symptom clusters. A remarkable diversity of heritages was identified, and posttraumatic distress was elevated in ethnic/racial minority patients. Policy-relevant clinical investigations that combine evidence-based treatments, bilingual/bicultural care-management strategies, and support for trauma center organizational capacity building may be required in order to enhance the quality of mental health care for diverse injured trauma survivors.

Abstract = {In an effort to investigate the students' experience of African American Student Network (AFAM), we conducted a pilot study with 5 AFAM students. The pilot study focused on understanding AFAM through the eyes of the students. In-depth semi-structured interviews and an adaptation of interpretive phenomenological analysis were included to capture to students' experiences. The pilot study included two males and three females from 19-23 years old. Participation in AFAM ranged from 1 to 4 semesters. Year in school ranged from sophomore to senior. Three participants identified as African American, one identified as biracial, and one identified as bicultural (being a more recent African immigrant but also feeling connected to African American culture). The pilot study was based in qualitative research rooted in phenomenology—the study of the "lived" experience of a phenomenon— which emphasizes the in-depth exploration of the experiences of a small number of research participants. Seven themes were identified in students' experiences of AFAM: (a) a safe space, (b) connectedness, (c) validation, (d) resilience, (e) intellectual stimulation, (f) empowerment, and (g) a home base. Quotes exemplify the richness of each theme. The results of the pilot study provide some empirical evidence for how AFAM is meeting the needs of African American students on our campus.

This paper demonstrates that bilingual learning is also beneficial for second and third-generation children whose English is often stronger than their mother tongue. Presenting data from an action research project in East London primary schools, we show how children investigated metaphor and cultural content in a Bengali lullaby, clarifying concepts through dialogue with their parents. Comparison with a lullaby in English from North America generated additional ideas concerning different cultural values. The learning process enabled children to use their bilingual skills and draw on different aspects of their bicultural identities. Finally, we explain how bilingual poetry can be used to stimulate learning in a multilingual classroom context, through the example of a whole-class lesson based around Bengali and English lullabies.

Abstract = {The present article explores whether effects of cultural primes are influenced by identity motives as well as by construct accessibility. The authors hypothesized that assimilative responses (shifting one's judgments toward the norm of the primed culture) are driven by identification motives, whereas contrastive responses (shifting away from this norm) are driven by disidentification motives. Evidence for this claim was attained in reanalyzes of past data sets and a new study of Chinese American biculturals, using improved measures of identification and disidentification motives. Consistent with the identity-motive hypotheses, assimilative responses to American-culture primes occurred for high (but not low) identifiers with American culture, and contrastive responses to Chinese-culture primes occurred for high (but not low) disidentifiers with Chinese culture. Results disconfirmed an alternative account predicting that contrast effects hinge on trait self-consciousness. Consistent with an accessibility saturation account, judgment patterns already heightened in accessibility by the task structure were not made more likely by priming.

Abstract = {Three studies examined the form and function of ideologies that negate (versus recognise) the historical basis of claims for reparation for past injustices. Historical negation (a) predicted opposition towards the resource-specific aspects of social policy and (b) functioned as the mechanism though which majority group members high in a threat-driven security-cohesion motivation (indexed by right-wing authoritarianism (RWA)) legitimated policy opposition in both undergraduate student (Study 1) and general population (Study 2) samples of the majority group (New Zealand Europeans/Pakeha). Study 3 experimentally manipulated historical negation in a general population sample using extracts adapted from political speeches, and demonstrated that historical negation increased opposition among liberal voters towards the resource-specific aspects of bicultural policy. These results suggest that history serves an important symbolic function in mobilising support for public policies regarding intergroup relations because temporal continuity is central to claims of legitimacy, especially where resources are involved. Research in this area is important for any nation with a history of intergroup conflict, as it aids not only in understanding the form and function of historical narratives that legitimate social inequality, but also provides insight into the ways in which such discourses can be countered and re-formulated in order to promote social equality.

Abstract = {Fourteen Latina immigrants participating in an innovative home visiting program for mothers of infants and young children at risk of child maltreatment were interviewed about their experiences coming to the United States, conditions they were living in after arriving, and perceptions of the intervention. Findings from the qualitative analyses detail rich, descriptive information regarding the struggles and adaptations of the immigrant mothers and families. Poverty in home countries propelled these women to move to the United States, leaving close family and sometimes children behind. Harrowing journeys to a new country are chronicled as well as the women's isolation and depression, and the strengths they utilized in adapting to new lives. Findings provide insight into the role of the bilingual/bicultural home visitors who were overwhelmingly perceived as helpful in providing emotional support, case management/advocacy, translation, education, and friendship. Implications include the need for mental health and social service providers to (a) appreciate viscerally the histories of immigrant clients, (b) understand the role of the home visitor-client relationship in enhancing client engagement and retention, and (c) recognize the multi-dimensional contribution of paraprofessional home visitors.

Abstract = {Information about the extent and patterns of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure among Korean Americans is sparse, despite the population's having one of the highest male smoking rates. This paper estimates the prevalence of ETS exposure among Korean American nonsmokers in California, and identifies demographic and other characteristics associated with exposure. Data were collected during 2001-2002 from telephone interviews (in English or Korean) with 2,328 nonsmoking Korean American adults. ETS was encountered by 31% of respondents during a typical day. Exposure was most common in "other locations," where 24% of respondents were exposed, compared with 6% at home and 9% at work. Among those exposed, the greatest dose of exposure occurred at work (6 cigarettes/day) and at home (5 cigarettes/day). Women were four times more likely than men to be exposed to ETS at home (8% vs. 2%, respectively). For both men and women, the odds of exposure were greater among those who were younger, who were unmarried, and whose friends smoked. Additionally, traditional men and bicultural women had greater odds of ETS exposure than those who were more acculturated. Women who were married to smokers, had no children at home, consumed more alcohol, and had no home smoking ban also had greater likelihood of exposure. The results indicate the need for a complete ban of smoking in workplaces and in private homes to prevent exposure, particularly for women whose husbands smoke.

Abstract = {This article describes the adaptation and preliminary validation of the Race-Related Stressor Scale (RRSS) for use with Muslim Americans. The RRSS was developed as a measure of race-related stress experienced by Asian American veterans of the Vietnam War. The adapted measure, the Perceived Religious Discrimination Scale (PRDS), measures stress related to the perception of religious discrimination on three dimensions: stress associated with the perception of societal anti-Muslim discrimination; stress associated with incidents of personal discrimination; and bicultural identification with the Muslim-civilian victims of the Iraqi and Afghan conflicts. The PRDS appears to be a psychometrically sound measure of perceived religious discrimination and demonstrates high internal consistency. A factor analysis replicated the three dimensions existent in the original measure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Presents a case report of Ms. C, a 53-year-old heterosexual, Catholic, divorced Mexican woman, mother of three adult children, one of whom was killed by a drunk driver 10 years prior to this treatment episode. Ms. C migrated legally to the United States at 19 years of age after marrying a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent whom she had known since her childhood. Her English vocabulary is very limited, but as she has always lived in a predominantly Latino neighborhood near the United States-Mexico border in southern San Diego county, she has been able to cope. In this case, there were several different factors that contributed to the initial inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate treatments of Ms. C's bipolar disorder. Language was a problem, but the deeper miscommunication was an even larger problem. She said that she had informed her psychiatrist of hermanic symptoms but was not understood because she used Spanish expressions and idioms. She received treatment only for depressive symptoms because they created the most visible distress. In sum, the patient's expressed ambivalence toward feelings of belonging and alienation in both cultures gives us a brief representation of the bicultural, and marginally bilingual, patient.

Abstract = {Integration is the crucial concept in psychology of acculturation. Yet, it has been loosely defined in the literature and there is no theory of intercultural psychological integration. Upon careful examination of research findings, at least five different meanings of integration emerge. Most known among them is Berry's approach, which considers and measures integration in terms of attitudinal preferences for biculturalism. Four other belong to cultural psychology and refer to: culture perception and evaluation; functional/partial specialization; identity and frame switching; and ethno-relativist constructive marginality. Empirical evidence shows that these are separate, and sometimes negatively correlated constructs. This paper is the first step attempt towards a theoretical model of integration in which all the five meanings are positioned as in depth directed layers of the bicultural psyche.

Abstract = {This study examines predictors of Western physician utilization using the Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use for Chinese elders who reside in Shanghai and immigrant Chinese elders who reside in the US Chinese elders are under-studied relative to their population size and in the US are known to underutilize the healthcare system. Underutilization is highly correlated with poor health and well-being. A unique dataset allowed us to examine predictors of physician utilization for Chinese elders who resided in different countries, in an effort to determine how being an immigrant affects utilization. One hundred and seventy-seven Chinese elders in Boston and 420 Chinese elders in Shanghai participated in the survey. Multiple regression analyses were conducted separately for each sample. Predictors of physician visits for the Boston sample are insurance status, health, and social network, and for the Shanghai sample, use of Chinese medicine, health, and marital status predicted physician visits. We found that access to care variables significantly affects physician utilization for immigrant elders, and that Chinese elders in Shanghai utilize a bicultural system of care. The results indicate that in order to create effective healthcare practices for elder Chinese, alternative healthcare beliefs should be understood by Western physicians.

Abstract = {Background: Education is a basic prerequisite for d/Deaf people's health. Deaf education varies considerably from country to country and we still know very little about the reasons for such variation. Objective: To identify international megatrends that influence the current Deaf bilingual education move (Deaf Bilingual-Bicultural education; DBiBi) worldwide. Methods: Using the Delphi technique, 41 experts in d/Deaf education (nine Deaf, 32 hearing) from 18 countries identified, ranked, and rated international megatrends in DBiBi education. Results: The process revealed six main essential elements of the international implementation of DBiBi education and nine main barriers against it. The top five promoting forces in that list in order of priority were: (1) societal and political changes towards a growing acceptance of diversity and Deaf issues; (2) growing Deaf activism, self-awareness and empowerment; (3) scientific research in sign linguistics and bilingualism; (4) changes in the d/Deaf educational community; and (5) international cooperation. The top five hindering forces included: (1) the view of deafness as a medical condition with a technological solution; (2) phonocentrism and societal resistance to the unknown; (3) educational and d/Deaf educational policies; (4) DBiBi education weaknesses; and (5) invisibility, heterogeneity and underperformance of the d/Deaf population. Conclusion: The results of this study reveal that social/political changes and a medical/social model of Deaf people's health can promote or limit Deaf people's educational options much more than changes within the education system itself, and that a transnational perspective is needed in deciding how best to support DBiBi education at a national and local level in an increasingly globalised world.

Abstract = {American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual-gestural language identified as the first or natural language of many persons who are deaf in the United States. For over 200 years, it has been the focal point of a heated controversy regarding optimal teaching methodologies for deaf children in the American elementary and secondary educational systems. One perspective is that deaf people should assimilate into American culture by learning to respond verbally as hearing people do, and the opposing perspective is that deaf people are bicultural and have the right to be educated using their native language. In tandem with this debate over language use in the classroom have been the civil rights struggles of deaf Americans to attain recognition of ASL as a language and to obtain interpreting services in educational, medical, legal, and employment settings. Following the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990), ASL began to gain recognition as a language at the post secondary level, and is accepted as a foreign language or elective academic credit by colleges and universities in 40 states across the nation today.

Abstract = {Throughout the English-speaking world, children from bilingual backgrounds are being educated in mainstream classrooms where they have little or no opportunity to use their mother tongue. Second and third generation children, in particular, are assumed to be learning sufficiently through English only. This study investigated how British Bangladeshi children, learning Bengali in after-school classes but mostly more fluent in English than in their mother tongue, responded when able to use their full language repertoire within the mainstream curriculum. Through action research with mainstream and community language class teachers, bilingual literacy and numeracy tasks were devised and carried out with pupils aged seven to eleven in two East London primary schools. The bilingual activities were video-recorded and analysed qualitatively to identify the strategies used. The following cognitive and cultural benefits of bilingual learning discovered by researchers in other contexts were also found to apply in this particular setting: conceptual transfer, enriched understanding through translation, metalinguistic awareness, bicultural knowledge and building bilingual learner identities. The findings suggest that second and third generation children should be enabled to learn bilingually, and appropriate strategies are put forward for use in the mainstream classroom.

Abstract = {This case incident of client Y. by Marianne C. Kastrup and Armando Báez-Ramos develops in the heart of the immigrant neighborhood in Copenhagen and the psychiatric department of the University Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. Y. is a young woman in her 20s. Her parents moved from a Middle Eastern country to Denmark about 20 years ago, when Y. was 4 years old. Y.'s contact with the psychiatric system started while she was trying to complete her high school education. She was eventually diagnosed as having a psychotic condition. The authors discuss her problems; treatment, including medication refusal and psychiatric commitment; relationship considerations; and transition outcomes. They also comment on cultural competence; direct communication using a psychoeducational approach; and cultural norms and values. In Response 1, Roy Moodley, Dina B. Lubin, and Saadia Akram consider Y.'s narrative, which appears to be intertwined with a number of psychosocial, cultural, and religious constructs (Y. is Muslim). We examine how these factors came to influence and shape Y.'s subjectivity and, consequently, her psychological difficulties. We discuss and analyze the process of therapy that Y. undertook. This is followed by a discussion on the incorporation of family and community values into counseling and psychotherapy. Finally, we attempt a broader consideration of the use of multicultural counseling competencies in working with such a client. In Response 2, Monica Justin discusses cross-cultural transitions; cross-cultural issues, including (a) acculturation and differential acculturation levels among family members, (b) cultural values and cultural values conflicts, (c) challenges of constructing and negotiating a bicultural and hybrid identity, and (d) personal coping mechanisms; and counseling and cross-cultural competency.

We thank Rail for her uneasy work in translating our abstract. During the composition of earlier drafts, we grew increasingly aware of the tenuous status of our Anglocentric history of Quebec, which Rail checks in part with delectable folk lyrics. Rail's amendment to our admittedly brief history of English and French Canada is both poignant and welcomed. Her response offers a politics of particularity that situates and contests the essentialist terms in which Canadian bicultural mythologies appear in our original essay. If we understand Rail's response correctly, our engagement of irony does not work because of an Anglocentric, and thus partial, historical account of Quebec. In her commentary, Rail undercuts the imagined incommensurability of French colonial binaries by introducing the concept of message, which is an insightful point for negotiating irony. To trouble our singular history of Quebec, Rail draws on the term as an expression of hybridity, a "braiding" between the already unstable positionings of colonizer and colonized that is often idealized as an interruption of European colonialist hierarchies. In the context of Rail's wider critique, irony seems to be an "improper starting point" not necessarily because of its harmful potential but rather because of our "flawed" historical introduction. While Rail suggests that Dunky is only ironic within a dominant English-Canadian discourse, we believe Dunky targets and interrupts this very discourse. The mascot was quite legible, offensive, and sometimes amusing for some French-language bloggers of our study. It was not always unintelligible or nonsensical.

Abstract = {Purpose: This was a pilot study to assess the usability and impact of a feedback-based environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) reduction approach for Latino families. Design: A one-group, pre-post design was used. Methods: Information from hair samples from children analyzed for nicotine was used to create three feedback versions presented in a counterbalanced fashion. The intervention was conducted by a promotora in the participants' homes, with mailed materials and over the phone. Fifty Latino parent-child pairs were recruited. Parents were Spanish-speaking smoking adults (typically the mother) who reported exposing their children to ETS. Intervention efforts included home visits to provide nicotine feedback and counseling, two mailers presenting alternative versions of the feedback, and a supportive telephone call delivered over a 6-week period. Pre-post assessments conducted by a bicultural measurement technician measured parent reports of children's ETS exposure and children's hair nicotine. Parents' liking/usability of the three feedback formats was measured at the post-assessment. Paired t-tests assessed pre-post changes in exposure outcomes. Results: Parents' reports of exposure and children's hair nicotine levels showed statistically significant reductions. Parents liked all three feedback formats, particularly a comparative graphic format. Conclusions: Consistency of the positive findings suggests that this feedback approach to ETS reduction warrants further study with a more rigorous design.

Consequently, this book covers numerous domains. This book would be good reading for researchers and anyone else interested in a political discourse on biculturalism.

Abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of socio-economic variables and migration history on the prevalence of betel nut and smokeless tobacco use in both UK- and Bangladeshi born migrant women resident in London. No significant difference in betel nut use prevalence was found among women of different generations. However, in all groups betel nut users were significantly older and less educated than non-users. Among first generation women there was no effect of either length of time living in the UK or age at migration on use of betel nut, even after controlling for current age. No significant differences in prevalence use due to language spoken, occupation, marital status or borough of residence in London were found. We conclude that, although there are some indications of a change in behavior among younger individuals, betel nut chewing is a practice very much present among Bangladeshi women born and brought up in a bicultural context.

Abstract = {Empirical research has shown that exposure to race-related stressors in the military by Asian American Pacific Islander Vietnam veterans, now reliably measurable, contributes uniquely and significantly to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and generalized psychiatric distress; moreover, studies reveal that adverse race-related events can meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. Competence in treating PTSD or general psychiatric distress requires understanding the types of, and effects of, adverse race-related events experienced by ethnic minority veterans. Case studies highlight two types of race-related stressors—“bicultural identification and conflict” and “racial stigmatization”—which placed the veteran at greater risk of death and reduced cohesion with fellow service members. The studies demonstrate the presence of race-related stressors in one or more of the four major types of war zone stressors: traditional combat, atrocities-abusive violence, perceived threat, and malevolent environment. These case studies supplement the empirical findings on racerelated stressors and PTSD, enlarging the clinician’s understanding of this unique type of mental health risk factor.

Abstract = {The offenses of Virginia Tech senior Seung-Hui Cho that ended in the death of thirty-three people and the wounding of numerous others was enough to disorient anyone; when these crimes were considered in conjunction with his Korean ethnicity, the world was not only stunned but confused. The majority of Koreans, immigrants and foreigners alike, expressed shame and guilt that one of their own had caused such monumental damage. As a bilingual and bicultural Korean American licensed counselor, the current author was summoned by Virginia Tech to conduct counseling, education, and outreach mostly with Asian students on campus in the aftermath of the shootings. While the violence could have been perpetrated by an adolescent of any racial or ethnic background, it is important to examine the incident using a multicultural lens and to acknowledge the cultural context in which the incident took place. The aim of this article is not to cast blame but to examine salient cultural factors that may have contributed to the incident and to explore preventative interventions from a multicultural perspective.

Results revealed a range of career barriers and workplace difficulties encountered by these participants, as well as solutions found and strategies used by them. Differences in employment sector, job-search activities, difficult workplace situations, and use of accommodations were noted between 2 groups: those who communicated primarily in Australian Sign Language and considered themselves to have a Deaf or bicultural identity and those who communicated primarily in spoken English and considered themselves to have a hearing identity. Implications for university services supporting deaf and hard-of-hearing students are outlined, and suggestions for further research are made.

Abstract = {Racial and ethnic disparities in health care have been attributed in part to cultural and linguistic dissonance between certain patient populations and the health care system. Yet in the long term, structural solutions for ameliorating health care disparities have not been forthcoming. One strategy for increasing access to care for cultural and linguistic minorities is ethnicity-specific subsystems of care. The historical experiences of the Chinese community in San Francisco are used to reconstruct the evolution of its ethnicity-specific health care infrastructure and to create an organizational development model for ethnicity-specific health care organizations and infrastructures. The four stages of the model include developing and recruiting a bicultural and bilingual health care workforce, structuring health care resources for maximum accessibility, expanding health care organizations, and integrating ethnicity-specific health care resources into the mainstream health care system. Policy recommendations to develop ethnicity-specific subsystems of care are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Taiwan-born mothers' perceptions of sexual health affect their Taiwanese American girls' sexual perceptions. Taiwanese American girls grow up balancing two different cultural influences (Taiwanese and American) while living in the majority society. The process of balancing two different cultures is called bicultural straddling. Four separate focus group interviews with two sets of mothers and daughters (N = 20) were conducted to understand intergenerational transmission of thoughts, perceptions, values, and attitudes associated with sex-related taboos and their impact on sexual communication, safety, and sexual health of second-generation Taiwanese American girls. The findings suggest that mother-daughter relationships, particularly mothers' traditional cultural values, influence their daughters' decision-making process. A secondary finding suggests that these girls tend to experience mental strain if they decide to go against their mothers' advice. Implications are that maternal involvement should be increased and further studies conducted to understand mother-daughter relationships, their pattern of sexual-related communicating, and expectations.

Abstract = {Objective: In New Zealand and Australia, a renewed emphasis on equity and efficiency in the provision of mental health care has seen outcomes-focused, culturally appropriate clinical practice become essential within mental health services. Ascertaining the degree to which quality improvement and monitoring systems are enhancing professional practice and patient outcomes, however, is hindered by the difficulty of measuring the process of quality care delivery. Method: This paper argues that it is the process of care delivery (i.e. what clinicians do to, and for, patients) that is critical to the effectiveness of treatment and the degree to which treatment either inhibits or promotes an improvement in mental health recovery. Identification of the underlying causes of poor achievement of process factors is likely to positively impact on things such as readmission rates, shared care initiatives, and ultimately patient recovery. Such attention could be the difference between low-quality service provision and a high-quality service provision with positive recovery outcomes for patients. Results: Ascertaining the degree to which quality improvement and monitoring systems are enhancing professional practice and patient outcomes for indigenous people, however, is hindered by the difficulty of measuring such concepts. Australia has indeed embraced 'culturally appropriate' practice in recent years, but this appears to be piecemeal when compared with New Zealand. Certainly, there are inconsistent and variable approaches to cultural practices with indigenous people when comparing the two countries. Conclusions: Using evidence from a bicultural mental health nursing study that developed and validated generic and Mâori-specific (indigenous) clinical indicators for mental health nursing standards of practice in New Zealand, it is argued that the process of care delivery is equally as important as outcome measures when ascertaining the effectiveness of nursing care. Second, this paper contends that accurate process measures must be culturally responsive to indigenous and other ethnic groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Given the assumption that mass media reflect the cultural values of a society, this study investigates the effects of American and Korean mass media on Korean immigrants' acculturation process. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression modeling were used to evaluate how exposure to mass media is related to the acculturation process. The survey results from the two different analyses were consistent with each other, in that exposure to American mass media was a significant positive predictor for the acceptance of American cultural values and a significant negative predictor of the affinity for Korean cultural identity. However, exposure to Korean mass media was related to neither immigrant's affinity for Korean cultural identity nor acceptance of American cultural values. Thus, we surmise that even though Korean immigrants are frequently exposed to both American and Korean mass media, they tend to be Americanized instead of bicultural due to the strong effects of the American media.

Abstract = {This article links the empirical literature on race and ethnicity in developmental psychopathology with interventions designed to reduce adolescent problem behavior. We present a conceptual framework in which culture is endogenous to the socialization of youth and the development of specific self-regulatory strategies. The importance of cultural influence is identified at three levels: (a) intrapersonal developmental processes (e.g., ethnic identity development, development of coping modifies mechanisms and self-regulatory mechanisms), (b) family socialization processes (e.g., racial and ethnic socialization), and (c) interaction with larger societal contexts (e.g., maintenance of bicultural competence in adapting to mainstream and ethnic cultures). We discuss limitations of current assessment and intervention practices that focus on reducing adolescent problem behavior with respect to the cultural issues identified above. We propose that empirically supported adaptive and tailored interventions for adolescent problem behavior are optimal for serving multicultural children and families. To empower such interventions to better serve children and families of color, it is essential that assessments that guide the adaptation and tailoring process include culturally salient dynamics such as ethnic identity, racial socialization, and culturally informed parenting practices.

Abstract = {In this article I analyze two cases that are the result of parents' complaints against education authorities for alleged indirect discrimination on the basis of their child's lack of access to instruction through Auslan in regular school settings. Although bilingual/bicultural programs for deaf students in Australia are available in some special schools and deaf facilities, the subject of complaint in these cases relates to the lack of provision of regular classroom staff members who are fluent in Auslan. Both cases were decided in favor of the complainants. Despite the parents' calls for Auslan to be used with their deaf children, the formal complaints, and attempts at conciliation, the education providers have maintained a vigorous defense (in one case also appealing the decision of the Federal Court of Australia). It is therefore of potential interest to educational researchers and sign linguists to know how the respondents argued their cases against the use of Native Sign Language (NSL) in the classroom. Legal counsel is bound to represent its clients' views; therefore, the defendants' arguments are a reflection of the views and attitudes of the education authorities whom they represent. This article provides a detailed account of their denial of the claims of discrimination. In doing so, it presents perhaps the first comprehensive account in the public domain of the way in which these authorities view NSL and their reasons for denying its use with deaf children for whom Auslan is their first or preferred language.

Consistent with tenets of objectification theory, body shame mediated the links of internalization and body surveillance with eating disorder symptoms.

Das's research stems from accessibility-based interviews with 25 women, ages 16 to 73, who live in the second-largest Cambodian settlement in the United States, the "All America" city of Lowell, Massachusetts. Das's stated aim in undertaking this study is to focus on "the experiences and problems faced by Cambodian women." The study was undertaken for several reasons. First, as an immigrant herself, Das argues that she is cognizant of the many bicultural issues facing these new immigrants. Second, Das posits that due to the "legacy of war," far more women survived to become the new heads of households in their new residences in Lowell. Third, Das observes that the vast differences between women's gender roles in the homeland compared to the United States make "the problem of 'fitting in' much greater for women" than for men. Finally, she interviews two generations of Cambodian women to illustrate the social and cultural conflicts faced by parents as they struggle against "the excessive freedom children have" in the United States juxtaposed to their girls having to struggle with the social norms of the new homeland and parental demands to maintain their Cambodian heritage. The reviewer recommends this book because it captures a portion of Cambodian women's lives as they make the transition to the United States.

Abstract = {The United States has a long historical tradition of coeducation. Unfortunately, studies and statistics have shown that in the case of gender, coeducation does not guarantee equality. Title IX was flawed in that it offered an educational solution to a problem that is societal and cannot be fully resolved within the schools. Until women achieve full equality in American society, schools will continue to replicate these biases and inequalities within our coeducational classrooms. Single-sex schools offer an alternative that appeals to many parents. Latinas and African Americans in particular have been shown to benefit from this type of education. With the recent popularity of single-sex schools in the United States, and their immense appeal to minority parents in NYC in particular, it is vital that we understand all the factors behind their success. Not all single-sex schools are created equally. Differing school philosophies and ideologies make for vastly different educational experiences. The philosophy/ideology of The Young Women's Leadership School (TYWLS), for example, is for the most part Eurocentric, feminist, and color/culture blind. This may not be what most Latino parents have in mind when they think of a single-sex education for their daughters. I would venture a guess that many of the girls (and families) who choose to come to this school do so because they too have incorporated a "cultural deficit model." For girls who are more firmly grounded in their Latina culture, this school can become a ground for contestation and identity conflicts. The research has shown that the more successful Latinas are those that learn to meld the two cultures into a "homogenous, bounded unitary, whole." In addition, the history of the education of Latinos (as described by Nieto), particularly of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans, in the United States has been one of struggle to maintain a bicultural and bilingual identity as both a "defense against a hostile environment and as a nonnegotiable demand for educational improvement." Why has the discourse on single-sex education resurfaced at this particular time in history? Who are the actors behind this resurgence? Why have Latinas been targeted? Who actually benefits from the legal changes that have emerged from the incorporation of single-sex education? TYWLS serves as a distraction to the injustices and educational inequities that confront the majority of Latino children of both genders on a daily basis and in fact, as the numbers show, benefit only a very small minority (recent statistics for TYWLS show a decrease in the graduation rate from 97% in 2002 to 85.7% in 2004, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores in both the verbal and math were lower on average than those in city schools and only 35% of 2004 graduates went on to four-year colleges as opposed to slightly over 50% of city school graduates). In spite of this, the No Child Left Behind Act included a bipartisan amendment which called for single-sex schools and programs as one of twenty-seven "innovative Assistance Programs." In the spring of 2002, the Department of Education announced its intention to loosen Title IX guidelines to allow for single-sex education. The result has been the opening of many more single-sex schools and programs across the country. I do not believe this new brand of American feminist, culture-blind single-sex education can work for the general Latina population. However, with the recent popularity of single-sex schools in the United States, and their immense appeal to minority parents in NYC in particular, it is vital that we understand all the factors behind their success.

Abstract = {Findings are presented from research examining the relationship between shame traits and acculturation status (i.e., Mexican, Anglo, and Bicultural orientations, level/type) of Chicano students (N = 90). Six out of twenty-four shame traits were significantly related to acculturation status; one descriptive-acculturation trait (awareness of ethnic background) lowered shame scores, and place of birth of parents and grandparents affected self-esteem scores. A major consideration in this paper is for educators to evaluate shame and acculturation traits of college students and utilize experiential, adult learning, and strengths-centered approaches to structure teaching in the context of these traits. This study has implications for advancing knowledge on these subjects through replication with diverse student and probability samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Aotearoa/New Zealand has been forged in the interaction between indigenous (Māori) and settler peoples within the context of colonisation and resistance. A treaty signed in 1840 continues to play a central, if contested, role in mediating a bicultural relationship. Community psychology concepts are reflective of Maori world views, which emphasise the interrelationship of people, land, sea, and the elements; the importance of placing people within their historical, social, and geographic context; and a strong preference for collectivist arrangements over individualism. Collectivist traditions can also be found within (mainly British) settler society. Within the academy, these local traditions have been attenuated by imported scholarship, primarily British and American. Feminist and culturally anchored critiques of mainstream psychology have been particularly influential, and, in recent years, Kaupapa Māori approaches to research and action. Values, especially social justice, collaboration, and diversity, are central to teaching and practice. Practitioners work in a wide range of settings and roles, mostly outside what is commonly regarded as the province of psychologists. They typically work at the macro and meso levels, fulfilling roles such as policy analyst, planner, health promoter, advocate, community developer, researcher, and evaluator.

The treatment, which took place in a church-run maternity home, addressed oppositional behavior and anger and evoked profound questions of gender and culture. These clinical data are discussed from a multidimensional model of gender, race, and ethnicity; cultural meanings; psychological trauma; and power.

These factors are even more complex in a culturally insensitive environment, such as a school. This incident relates the case of a young boy whose identity development journey led him to be inappropriately diagnosed. The expert respondents offer insight into appropriate intervention using reality theory and systemic consultation. "Gerald Collins," a 10-year-old biracial child whose mother was Caucasian and whose father was African American, lived in a predominantly African American community. Gerald was an only child. His mother was a homemaker, and his father was in the Army Reserves. The family had lived in the community for 2 years. In the neighborhood, there were two other bicultural families. Each of the families had one biracial child who had at least two other single-race siblings. Gerald's school was racially mixed, with African American students accounting for approximately 50% of the student population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

This book tells of the trials and tribulations of Oscar, a black Dominican nerd from New Jersey, and of his mother and her family, whose lives were brutally affected by the political atrocities in her native country. The way the author captures the feel of the English-Spanish bilingual and bicultural world of a segment of urban population in the United States makes his novel such a pleasure to read. From a psychological standpoint, the book is about political trauma, its impact on a nation of people and on individual lives across generations.

Abstract = {This study examines the biliteracy development of a group of bilingual Latino third graders in an elementary school in the south-west USA. It focuses on the role of language in children's reading comprehension of narrative texts in Spanish and English in a school context. The authors frame their analysis within the 'Continua of Biliteracy' model (Hornberger, 1989, 2003), highlighting how the youngsters drew on their linguistic resources to negotiate the contexts and contents of biliteracy. Data come from the students' 24 retellings of story books, alternating between Spanish and English. The data were analyzed using story grammar and sociolinguistic analysis. The findings of the study show how, for young bilingual and bicultural students, their languages themselves exist on a continuum. That is, in developing their biliteracy, these children navigate linguistic borderlands through their use of Spanglish, reflecting their sociolinguistic and sociocultural realities where there are not necessarily strong distinctions between Spanish and English.

Abstract = {One in five children living in the United States is an immigrant or a child of an immigrant, and 62% of these children are Latino. Through qualitative methods, this study identifies ways that Latino immigrant parents with adolescent children cope with their new environment and how that environment shapes their parenting practices. Two primary themes emerge: overcoming new challenges and finding new strengths. Immigrant parents discuss the challenges of overcoming fears of the unknown; navigating unfamiliar work, school, and neighborhood environments; encountering and confronting racism; and losing family connections and other forms of social capital. In response to these challenges, immigrant parents discuss developing bicultural coping skills, increasing parent-child communication, empathizing with and respecting their adolescent children, and fostering social supports. The results fit well with a risk and protective factor framework and provide a basis for improving policies and programs to support effective parenting in Latino immigrant families.

The author distinguishes the normative developmental achievement of self and group identity with pathological identity diffusion due to an earlier attachment disorder. The clinical case of a young male's experience of his Persian family's immigration to a new host country details the challenges encountered in ethnic identity formation and its interference in consolidating this ongoing process. The complicated task of self identity formation during this phase of development in the face of parental unresolved and ambivalent attitudes toward their own sense of threatened self and group identity diffusion is discussed. Parental intrapsychic conflict combined with environmental conflict such as racism, prejudice, and more recent paranoia toward Middle Eastern immigrant families interferes further with the normal identity formation process.

Abstract = {Parent training has been well documented as one of the most effective methods for reducing behavioral problems in children. There is a well-established link between parenting practices and the development of child behavioral problems. The research literature to date demonstrates that ineffective parenting practices are powerful predictors of early maladaptive conduct in children between the ages of 2-8. Economically disadvantaged children and families of color are typically underserved and lack access to preventive mental health services. However, culturally adapting an evidence-supported or empirically supported program is not an easy task. It is an arduous, time-consuming process that clearly extends beyond simple translation of training materials and use of bicultural providers. The implications drawn from the research presented here are important recommendations to consider when attempting to develop and implement a parenting program for diverse communities.

Utilizing theory from language contact situations, interactional sociolinguistics, and critical discourse analysis, it describes and explains how a prestigious societal institution, often analyzed as imposing its powerful voice on those less powerful, exhibits some permeability as it absorbs at least a few discursive representations of a less dominant bilingual and bicultural group. Traces of the Spanish- English contact situation, biculturalism, and Latino life find their way into the official discursive space via stereotype, topic, lexical items, prepositions, and some verbal constructions. The discussion covers why some legal arenas are more impervious to linguistic and cultural diversity (or "accented English") than are others. The conclusion discusses what such representations might mean for Latina women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study investigates the prevalence rates of violent and deviant behaviors among a sample of Filipino, Hawaiian, Japanese, and Samoan public high school students residing in Hawai'i, and is the first relatively large-scale study of its kind regarding a disaggregated sample of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) youth. Filipino, Hawaiian, and Samoan adolescents were the chosen ethnic groups for this study's focus due to their over-representation in Hawai'i's juvenile justice system. Methods: Data for this study were gathered collaboratively by researchers, community groups, and school officials who agreed that youth violence was a community concern worthy of deeper understanding and community response. The study's process included three phases: a focus group consultation phase, field-testing, and the final risk and protective factor study. For the final study, 326 randomly selected students representing three Hawai'i public high schools were surveyed on a one-on-one basis. A smaller sample of Japanese students was also included in the study, serving as a control group. Results: Findings illustrate the importance of disaggregating specific ethnic and gender groups within the AAPI ethnic category when examining adolescent issues. As examples, Samoan youth reported significantly higher rates of violence than other ethnic groups surveyed, and Hawaiian girls reported higher rates of substance use than Hawaiian boys, which was not commensurate with other ethnic groups. Filipino, Hawaiian, and Samoan youth all reported significantly higher rates than Japanese on overall deviant behavior. Conclusions: Implications for further research and community development include enhancing minority youths' bicultural self-efficacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Family and a cohort group of peers were identified as important sources of support and motivation. As a result of the struggles they experienced these paraeducators expressed a strong commitment of helping others to pursue academic and professional goals.

Abstract = {The current study examined the individual and joint effects of the Big Five personality traits and acculturation on coping styles. Using the proposed framework of McCrae (2001), the relations among these variables were evaluated at the intracultural level to exploit previously unexplored within-culture variability for an unstudied Asian American group (Korean Americans). This approach emphasizes the unique expression of specific personality traits in a single culture. A community sample of Korean Americans completed measures of the Five-Factor Model of Personality (NEO-PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992), coping (Brief COPE; Carver, 1997), and acculturation (SL-ASIA; Suinn, Ahuna, & Khoo, 1992). The results primarily showed statistically significant relations between the Big Five personality traits and coping. Neuroticism was positively related to indices of emotion-focused coping (emotional support) and avoidance (substance abuse, behavioural disengagement, venting, self-blame); Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness were positively related to indices of problem-focused (active coping, planning) and emotion-focused coping (positive reframing, humour, acceptance); and Agreeableness was positively associated with active coping and humour. Acculturation was only significantly (and positively) associated with venting. Significant Acculturation × Big Five personality traits interactions were found, however. For individuals high in acculturation, both Neuroticism and Openness were positively related to indices of avoidance coping. Moreover, for individuals low in acculturation, a negative relationship was found between Conscientiousness and venting. These results show that there is considerable within-culture variation for the dimensions of the Five-Factor Model of Personality, coping styles, and acculturation in this largely bicultural sample. Moreover, the amount of variation and its directionality among the target study variables is similar to that typically found in Caucasian American samples. Finally, the stronger relations found between the dimensions of personality and coping styles (relative to the relations found between acculturation and coping styles) suggests that personality traits rather than acculturation may be more important clinically when profiling patients and developing treatment plans.

Abstract = {To examine cultural variation in mothers' perceptions of hyperactive behaviors in school-age boys, we surveyed 135 mothers in 3 ethnic groups: Puerto Rican, Central and South American, and Anglo. Mothers read or heard 8 taped vignettes of boys with behaviors related to DSM-IV hyperactivity criteria. In 50% of the vignettes, Spanish-responding mothers were less likely to consider the boys' behaviors expected than were the English-responding mothers. In 62.5% of the vignettes, Latina mothers expressed more interest in discussing behaviors with their physicians than did the Anglo mothers, and in 62.5% of the vignettes, Spanish-responding mothers expressed more interest in discussing behaviors with their physicians than did the English-responding mothers. We found no association of the 2 scores by the bicultural scale. Mothers' perception of hyperactivity boys varies both with ethnicity and language of response. Latina mothers, especially Spanish-responding mothers, seem interested in discussing children's behavior with physicians. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

However, there is still a need to recognize the significant role of specific contextual factors and environmental conditions among ethnocultural family and group systems. The conceptual consensus about the family system has to include diversity as a central feature; furthermore, it has to be translated into specific interventions aimed to support family care for culturally diverse older adults with dementia. Bicultural and bilingual skills relative to Hispanics are part of the basic training of any intercultural competency model. In this chapter, we identify strategies to help community organizations' staff, managers, and leaders to promote and create multicultural engagements and dementia interventions directed to ethnically diverse populations, in particular, ethnocultural Hispanics such as Puerto Ricans.

Abstract = {Objective: Our objective in this study was to examine how family social-support expectations have changed among older Chinese and Korean U.S. immigrants. Methods: Fifty-two Cantonese- and Korean-speaking immigrants older than 60 years participated in eight focus groups. Transcripts were translated into English. Themes were developed based on a coding structure and compared to past research. Results: Participants discussed changed perspectives of family social support and the need to integrate both American and Chinese or Korean culture, thus becoming bicultural. Three distinct perspectives of family emerged: (1) participants felt they had become peripheral family members, (2) parents were no longer authority figures in families, and (3) participants were more independent. Finally, participants described how factors such as a changed economic environment, living alone, and extending their social network beyond family, promoted a move to biculturalism. Discussion: These results suggest that the integration of two cultures, or biculturalism, is an indicator of successful adaptation to immigration later in life; older Chinese and Korean immigrants are adjusting to living in the United States and blending multiple cultures simultaneously. Thus, acculturation frameworks implying a linear process may not be theoretically valid as ethnic identity, particularly for those who immigrate to different countries, changes over the life course.

Abstract = {Purpose: Increasingly, organizations in the Asia-Pacific region are recognizing the importance of cross-cultural management to the sustainability of their competitive edge. Although the literature is replete with cross-cultural studies of individualism and collectivism, little information is available on the factors that foster effective individualist-collectivist interaction (ICI) within organizations. This paper attempts to provide a theoretical description of individualists and collectivists at the individual level of analysis, which offers specific testable hypotheses about the effect of self-representation on prejudice between individualists and collectivists (ICs). Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, a theoretical model is presented in which intergroup prejudices and interpersonal prejudices mediate the effects of ICI and bicultural orientation toward cross-cultural experiences and, in which, the dissimilarity openness of the climate moderates the level and outcome of prejudices flowing from ICI. Findings: The model depicts that the outcomes of ICI are mediated by the intergroup prejudices of collectivists and the interpersonal prejudices of individualists, which are moderated by the extent of diversity-oriented HRM policies and practices and individuals' orientation to cross-cultural experiences. When workforces become culturally diverse, organizations should modify HRM practices to enable the full use of the range of skills and talents available from the diversity, and to ensure affective and behavioral costs are minimized. As globalization and international competition will continue to increase, organizations including those in the Asia-Pacific region, should seriously reevaluate their HRM policies to adapt and take advantage of an increasingly culturally diverse workforce. Originality/value: The model provides a useful basis upon which organization researchers and practitioners can base their respective agendas.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Enhancing the Well-Being of Children and Families Through Effective Interventions: International Evidence for Practice edited by Colette McAuley, Peter J. Pecora, and Wendy Rose (see record [rid]2006-04365-000[/rid]). The stated aim of the editors for this group of articles was to develop "an international collection of evidence on the effectiveness of some of the principal child welfare interventions of particular interest to policymakers, managers and practitioners" (p. 11). According to the introduction, the original impetus for the book was a meeting of international child welfare research experts in 2001. Based on this experience, the editors expressed the hope that "the presentation of evidence from both countries would stimulate further international comparison and learning." The book is arranged in sets of paired articles reviewing the evidence regarding a specific intervention topic area in the United Kingdom and the United States separately. The reviewer thinks this book succeeds in many ways. It provides solid reviews of the literature on the effectiveness of a range of child welfare interventions from the perspectives of knowledgeable U.K. and U.S. authors. There are chapters on some vital areas including residential treatment, foster care, home visiting, and school-based prevention programs. Several of the chapters are thought provoking, going beyond the typical literature review format to provide some real insight into the subject matter. Easy access to all of these reviews in one volume makes the book a useful resource to have on one's bookshelf, particularly for those psychologists who (like me) are not as well-read in the social work literature as in the psychological treatment literature. In sum, this is a worthwhile book that deserves a place on the bookshelves of service developers, policy makers, and service researchers. It is informative and comprehensive, but the reviewer feels it missed an opportunity to use its rare, bicultural viewpoints to provide new, transformed perspectives on a vitally important subject.

Abstract = {In this introductory chapter, the authors describe the unique challenges facing Latina adolescent girls living in the United States. Latinas have the opportunity to incorporate their cultural traditions with mainstream U.S. dominant culture, but at the same time, they often must respond to low expectations by others in order to pursue their goals and stay connected to their culture. Latina girls also have the opportunity to examine their cultural values and beliefs against U.S. culture and to create themselves as transcultural individuals. The term "transculturation" is defined as a multidimensional construct involving social interrelationships, language, media use, participation in rituals, and group identification. Transculturation is different from the term biculturalism in that people who are bicultural share or fuse two cultures. Transcultural Latinas identify with one culture and also incorporate behaviors from another culture. This book includes research on Latinas from across the United States, focusing primarily on regions in California, New York, Connecticut, Chicago, and Texas. It presents descriptions of the lives of Latina girls from diverse backgrounds with regard to country of origin, generation/immigration status, rural and urban setting, and social class. The authors use a range of methodological and theoretical approaches from psychology, anthropology, sociology, geography, public health, ethnic studies, and women's studies. Across chapters, there are different and complementary data sources, including surveys, interviews, observations, and focus groups. At the same time, all maintain a focus on the dynamics through which Latinas explore identities and confront the challenges in their lives.

Abstract = {A large body of research points toward the utility of evidence-based psychological assessment and interventions for ethnic minority populations (Miranda et al., 2005). However, cultural influences in the assessment of psychopathology still present a challenge for cognitive-behavioral therapists given the legitimate critique that cognitive-behavioral assessment measures (as well as treatments) have not been adequately validated in minority cultures (Bemal & Scharron-del-Rio, 2001; Hall, 2001; Haynes & O'Brien, 1990; Iwamasa, 1997; Wood, Garb, Lilienfeld, & Nezworski, 2002). Of course, cognitive-behavioral assessment is not alone in this regard; most measures of personality and psychopathology are limited in their cross-cultural validity. Moreover, the clinical self-report assessment instruments that have the best cross-cultural validation are the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the MMPI-2 (Wood et al., 2002), which are not as widely used in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Recognizing these limitations, this chapter provides an overview of major issues that may be helpful in conducting cognitive-behavioral assessments with culturally diverse clients. We include both self-report and behavioral measures, as CBT involves the evaluation of clients' cognitions in various forms and behavioral performance. First, information is provided regarding cross-cultural differences in self-reported affect, behavior, and well-being--research that has important implications for cognitive-behavioral assessments that rely heavily on self-report data. Second, the use of cognitive-behavioral instruments for assessing specific disorders, cognitive styles, and behavior with ethnic minority clients is discussed with special attention to one of the most commonly used self-report measures, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the BDI-II. Finally, several clinical approaches to culturally responsive cognitive-behavioral assessment are described, including functional analysis, the Culturally Informed Functional Assessment (CIFA) interview, the ADDRESSING framework, the Multicultural Assessment Procedure (MAP), the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue (EMIC), and a bicultural evaluation procedure used in New Zealand. A case example is used to illustrate functional analysis and the CIFA interview. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

This engaging volume describes the application of CBT with people of diverse cultures and discusses how therapists can refine cognitive-behavioral therapy to increase its effectiveness. The contributing authors examine the characteristics of some of the most common cultural groups in the United States, including American Indian, Latino, Asian, and African American as well as groups less commonly considered in multicultural psychology books, such as people of Alaska Native, Arab, and Orthodox Jewish heritage. The volume also describes the use of CBT with older adults, people with disabilities, and gay and lesbian individuals, including examples of people who hold bicultural and multicultural identities. A chapter on culturally responsive assessment, with an emphasis on the most frequently used cognitive-behavioral scales and a chapter on supervision, round out this volume.

Abstract = {By 1997, more than half of Asian Americans were not born in the United States (Lee, 1997). Asian immigrants in the United States have been mostly urban, well-educated technical and professional people. Many of them came to the United States for higher education. After completing their studies, they applied for a change of residency status from international students to permanent residents (Seth, 1995). The decision to become a permanent U.S. resident gives the immigrants opportunities to develop a more comfortable life than they would have in their country of origin (Locke, 1998); at the same time, it brings many unique life challenges. The majority of the Asian immigrants grew up in a monoculture and do not have a sufficient understanding of how to raise bicultural children in the United States. These parents often possess a strong desire to maintain their ethnic and cultural identity, while their children are experiencing the stress of developing their own identities and places in the U.S. society. Children from these families often feel mistreated by both their parents and their peer groups because their parents do not prepare them for or understand their struggles in coping with rejection by peers due to their ethnicity (Das & Kemp, 1997). Isolation and depression become common themes in these children's lives. Some children want to fit into their peer groups and will shed any cultural traits that set them apart from their peers. Their attempts to make changes also produce tensions between parents and children, or between grandparents and the younger children (Sandhu, 1997). In the past decade, more and more literature has addressed Asian mental health issues, which has helped counselors increase their cultural sensitivity to this population. However, reports on the effectiveness of these counseling treatments are still limited. The treatment strategies suggested in this article are based largely on the authors' and other Asian clinicians' successful clinical experiences.

The Intercultural Sensitizer (ICS) is a well-researched tool used in attribution training. The purpose of this study was to develop a Hawaiian ICS to train non-Hawaiian university personnel. The researcher gathered critical incidents from Hawaiian university students (N = 113); presented 20 edited, critical incidents to a bicultural Hawaiian panel (N = 6) to elicit culturally relevant attributions, and investigated the meanings Hawaiian students and non-Hawaiian students (N = 285) attributed to the critical incidents. Statistical tests indicated 3 of 20 critical incidents and 14 attributions were statistically significant, revealing finite, cultural differences between the Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian samples. Counseling and educational implications are suggested that should increase the chances of success among Hawaiian students enrolled in college.

Abstract = {Trafimow, Triandis, and Goto (1991) introduced the idea that people can have more than one self-concept. They used a priming manipulation to increase the accessibility of either the private or collective self, and obtained effects on the retrieval of self-cognitions. Since that time, there have been numerous advances in our understanding of the accessibility of self-concepts. These include the invention of new priming methodologies, the application of these methodologies to a variety of dependent variables, the use of culture and language to prime different self-concepts, the priming of self-related mental processes as well as self-related mental content, and the proposal of additional self-concepts. In addition, theorizing about the self has been applied to bicultural individuals. The present chapter reviews the original literature that opened up this area for investigation, advances that have been made since that time, and possible future directions. Throughout, there will be a heavy emphasis on the interplay between cultures and self-concepts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {It is not only the Asian immigrant or second-generation Asian who is psychologically caught between civilizations, but also the Euro-American therapist once he or she begins to work with them. The first part of the paper delves into the cultural self of the therapist. It then proceeds to the most difficult part of psychoanalytic therapy with Asian Americans: first recognizing a different normality/ psychopathology continuum and then locating where the patient's problems are located on this. Case examples indicate that empathy is often not enough, knowledge of the cultural/psychological make-up is necessary. The third part shows how the three psychosocial dimensions of Asian hierarchical relationship structure the therapy relationship. The fourth part explores the bicultural self of Asian Americans, contrasting the familial self of Asians with the individualized self of Euro-Americans and the conflicts this stirs up. Issues of anger, modes of communication, the magic-cosmic and spiritual worlds, and trauma from the homeland before immigration are also delved into.

Abstract = {Adult educators have a strong interest in designing courses that stimulate learning toward critical, more inclusive cultural perspectives. Critical reflection is a key component of both intercultural learning and a growing medium of instruction, the asynchronous computer conference (CC). This study combined qualitative methodology with a framework for assessment of intercultural reflection to examine interactions between intercultural experience and issues and cognitive and affective approaches to reflection in a graduate course exploring cultural difference taught through the CC medium. Results revealed that beliefs about cultural difference were mediated through critical self-reflection approaches through which students linked cultural positions to inequity, embraced negative emotions, questioned prejudices, reframed underlying premises, and linked experiences to previously learned habits. Online discussion was strongly influenced by the topics of race and, secondarily, by experience as marginalized biculturals or international sojourners.

The results strongly support the concept that ethnic identity and acculturation are related but separate processes. Ethnic identity scores were found to be highest in 1st generation, less acculturated Ss, and traditional acculturative types. Higher levels of acculturation were associated with less feelings of affirmation and belonging, and less feelings of ethnic identity achievement. High bicultural Ss were found to obtain higher scores in ethnic identity than low bicultural Ss, and high bicultural Ss were found to be oriented more toward others than those Ss who were classified as traditional or assimilated… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

As the third and final segment of the Casa de Esperanza case illustrates, there is no point of perfect balance. Part C documents the various mechanisms used to institutionalise the organisation's identity as a community-based Latina organization, including new structures, planning processes, and human resource management. In all, leaders strive to make the organization truly bicultural, allowing it to participate in mainstream circles while remaining grounded in core community values and practices. When faced by a new mandate from state funders, leaders use these internal changes as a new filter when considering the most appropriate action. As such, the case illustrates how proactive structural change can propel an organization to recognize realities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors examine cross-cultural variations in how people discount the future. Specifically, they predict that people from Western cultures are relatively less patient and therefore discount the future to a greater degree than do people from Eastern cultures, and thus Westerners value immediate consumption relatively more. Furthermore, on the basis of regulatory focus theory, the authors predict that when Easterners are faced with the threat of a delay in receiving a product (i.e., a prevention loss), they are more impatient, whereas when Westerners are faced with the threat of not being able to enjoy a product early (i.e., a promotion loss), their impatience increases. This enhanced impatience manifests in preference for expedited consumption of a product purchased online in two studies. In both studies, the authors used a priming methodology on "bicultural" Singaporean participants; the results support the predictions. In the second study, they also found evidence in support of the process-based explanation for the interaction between culture and message framing.

Abstract = {This study tested whether priming of cultural symbols activates cultural behavioral scripts and thus the corresponding behaviors, and also whether the behaviors activated are context-specific. Specifically, to activate the cultural knowledge of Chinese-American bicultural participants, we primed them with Chinese cultural icons or American cultural icons. In the control condition, we showed them geometric figures. Then, the participants played the Prisoner's Dilemma game with friends or strangers (the context manipulation). As expected, participants showed more cooperation toward friends when Chinese cultural knowledge was activated than when American cultural knowledge was activated. By contrast, participants showed a similarly low level of cooperation toward strangers after both Chinese and American culture priming. These findings not only support previous evidence on culture priming of social judgment and self-construals, but also (a) provide the first evidence for the effects of culture priming on behaviors and (b) demonstrate the boundary condition of culture priming.

Abstract = {Background. It is important for physicians to recognize and address potential cross-cultural communication barriers with their patients. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of trained medical interpreters for ensuring effective patient-provider communication. Medical interpreters also represent an untapped source of insight into common communication problems. Such insights can contribute to strengthening physicians' cross cultural communication skills. Objective. The purpose of this study was to explore professional medical interpreters' experiences and perspectives regarding patient-provider communication difficulties. Methods. Key informant interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of nine professional interpreters working at the Geneva University Hospitals general medicine outpatient clinic. Results. Interpreters described three domains where physicians and patients were likely to differ, and where mutual lack of awareness of those differences could lead to misunderstandings. These were: (1) ideas about the patient's health problem; (2) expectations of the clinical encounter; and (3) verbal and non-verbal communication styles. Interpreters recommended that cultural competence training for physicians focus on raising awareness about potential sources of misunderstanding and about the difficulties inherent in medical translation; providing basic background knowledge of patients' countries of origin; and adapting to patients' communication styles. While physicians' own perceptions of communication difficulties are important for developing learner-centered training activities, interpreters' bilingual and bicultural position allows for the identification of communication barriers that may be difficult for physicians to recognize.

Abstract = {Adult smokers were recruited during routine health care visits at primary care clinics located in three urban hospitals and were given a brief intervention and nicotine replacement therapy. Analyses compared bicultural (BC: n=60) or less acculturated (LA: n=138) Latinos and non-Latino White (NL: n=417) participants. Both Latino groups were significantly different from NL subjects in smoking rate and nicotine dependence. However, BC and NL subjects differed significantly from LA subjects in perceived benefits of quitting, perceived risk from smoking, and negative affect smoking. LA subjects had higher cessation rates than either BC or NL groups. Regression analyses showed that nicotine dependence and confidence in quitting predicted cessation at month 6, and acculturation appeared to moderate the relationship between smoking cessation and both confidence in quitting and nicotine dependence. These results provide support for the viability of brief interventions for smoking provided through health care delivery systems. Results also suggest that characteristics previously shown to be predictive of successful cessation in mixed or non-Latino populations may not be equally predictive of cessation across members of diverse populations.

Furthermore, acculturation preferences were measured both globally and across several domains of life. Results showed that immigrants' conflict handling preferences varied along social relationship with opponent and along conflict property. Contrary to the assumptions underlying an acculturation perspective, there were no systematic relationships between conflict handling preferences and global or domain-specific acculturation preferences. However, irrespective of their heritage, a majority of the immigrants were familiar with the conflict regulation styles of their host society.

Objectives: The purpose of the study was to evaluate a randomized culturally tailored intervention to prevent high-HIV-risk sexual behaviors for Latina women residing in urban areas. Methods: Mexican and Puerto Rican women (18-44 years of age; N = 657) who were sexually active during the previous 3 months were recruited and randomized into intervention and control groups. The intervention, facilitated by bilingual, bicultural, trained Latina women, consisted of culturally tailored sessions on understanding their bodies, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, condoms (myths and use), negotiating safer sex practices, violence prevention, and partner communication. Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed changes from baseline. Results: The intervention improved HIV knowledge, partner communication, risk-reduction behavioral intentions, and condom use, and decreased perceived barriers to condom use.

Abstract = {To better understand social and structural changes needed to maximize community-based participation in emergency preparedness, 27 organizations, representing 12 states, participated in a study of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health. The study assessed social change needs (social will, community readiness, assets, and barriers) and structural needs (organizational capacity to integrate services into emergency management efforts locally). Results show high social will but little community readiness. Most non-governmental organizations (NGOs; 96%) were willing, but ill-prepared (65%) to face large-scale emergencies. Assets include bilingual/bicultural personnel, cultural competency, local knowledge, and public trust. Barriers include lack of culturally appropriate training and resources. Structurally, most NGOs want to link with voluntary organizations (79%) and public health departments (74%), but lack integration and coordination. Maximizing timely participation of these underutilized stakeholders in emergency planning can ensure culturally-proficient, community-tailored emergency plans, increased public confidence, and timely compliance with evacuation orders, thus helping to save lives.

To increase diagnostic accuracy in these circumstances, official guidelines mandate the use of unbiased assessment procedures and multidisciplinary diagnostic input. Bilingual speech-language pathologists (BSLPs) are consultants on the multidisciplinary school teams evaluating bilingual students. BSLPs gather crucial diagnostic data to distinguish language differences from genuine language deficits. This article describes the consultant role of school BSLPs as consultant-consultee partnerships guided by bilingualism principles. The article discusses theoretical principles of bilingualism, applies such principles to engage consultees as key diagnostic informants, and concludes with implications of consultant-consultee collaborations in bilingual speech-language services and a diagnostic framework for consultant BSLPs in schools.

Abstract = {This study examined the relationship between identity patterns and the communication modes of deaf adolescents aged between 14 and 18 years in Turkey. They were currently being educated in state residential secondary schools for the deaf. Deaf adolescents were administered the 'Deaf Identity Scale' presented in Turkish using total communication modes. The instrument measuring identity choice was administered to 90 students at three residential state schools for the deaf. Based on the questionnaire responses, students were classified into three groups: those with a predominant Culturally Hearing Identity, those with a primary Culturally Deaf Identity, and those who identified with both groups - a Bicultural (Dual) Identity. Analyses focused on the relationship between the students' identities and the communication methods which they reported using. The data indicated that the dual identity was consistently associated with better communication and the use of combined modes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Immigration from one country to another is a complex psychosocial process which often has a lasting impact on the individual's identity and interpersonal relationships. Migration of people from India to the USA, although traceable to the early twentieth century, began in the earnest only about four decades ago. Although different in certain emotional aspects, these two groups of immigrants from India shared a common fate. The poignant affects associated with immigration often mobilize creativity. The internal struggle was not limited to the immigrants themselves. Its repercussions could clearly be seen in their offspring. An annotated filmography of the cinema of Indian diaspora forms the centerpiece of this contribution. We have also included short, experimental films in an attempt to be comprehensive and representative of the entire effort in this realm. American Desi A romantic comedy about a college freshman discovering his Indian-American identity. The movies listed above contain the depiction of a vast range of affects related to immigration. These include the sweet wistfulness of nostalgia, the cutting pain of grief, the fumbling tenderness of acculturation, and the insistent quandary of bicultural identity. The importance of these movies, however, goes beyond their ascetic accomplishments. Our purpose in writing this paper has chiefly been psycho-education.

Abstract = {Understanding Intercultural Communication offers a comprehensive look at foundational concepts of intercultural communication. Through its dynamic theme of flexible intercultural communication, authors Stella Ting-Toomey and Leeva Chung bridge the gap between intercultural communication theory and practice. This book is distinctive because of its balance between cross-national intercultural communication issues and U.S. domestic diversity issues. Written in a conversational style, the text presents up-to-date, identity-based frameworks and fresh approaches. By integrating current empirical research with lively intercultural examples, the authors ask thought-provoking questions throughout the text and pose intercultural ethical dilemmas for students to ponder. It offers strong coverage of topics such as the process of ethnic and cultural identity change, shock and intercultural adjustment, intercultural verbal communication styles, conflict facework interactions, romantic relationships and raising bicultural children, global identity challenges, decision-making choices in intercultural ethics. Highlights include: diversity Jeopardy boxes, Double-Take personal narratives and stories, Know Thyself mini-assessments, Quick Poll reaction polls, Picture This intercultural-interethnic poems, and Snapshots, illustrating cultural diversity and culture shock. In addition, dialogue scenes, global news clips, practical intercultural toolkits, and checkpoints reinforce student learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (cover)},

Abstract = {This exploratory study examined geriatric mental health clinicians' experiences and perceptions of the circumstances in which African American and Mexican American older adults access outpatient specialty mental health treatment and the factors that impede or facilitate such access. Eighteen mental health clinicians from three outpatient geriatric mental health clinics in one urban and two rural areas in central Texas discussed their perceptions in three focus groups and/or individual interviews conducted by the authors. The clinicians identified the common circumstances in which minority older adults' access to mental health treatment involves loss and grief in later life coupled with lack of informal social support. Although clinicians confirmed existence of the access barriers identified by previous studies (lack of understanding about mental disorders, shame and stigma, cultural differences, fear and distrust of the treatment system, primary care physicians' knowledge deficit about mental disorders, and financial and transportation barriers), they also identified minority older adults' lack of information on referral processes as a serious barrier. As access contributors, physician referral; support and encouragement from family, especially adult children; availability of bilingual/bicultural clinicians; and transportation were identified. Implications of the findings are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Social work has had a long tradition of group work practice with diverse immigrant communities, starting before Jane Addams s Hull House in Chicago during the 1890s and continuing up until the present day. While this chapter will focus on specific issues of cross-cultural group work with Asian Americans from East Asia--primarily China, Korea, and Japan--the chapter will begin by briefly addressing the universal themes that all immigrants experience in order to maximize its relevance for practitioners. An important aspect of the immigrant experience is the development of a bicultural identity, or "the ability to move freely between one's ethnic community and the larger culture" (Chau, 1990, p. 2), which helps maintain the immigrants' self esteem and facilitates their integration into the dominant culture. An important difference between Asian and Western cultures is the Asian emphasis on nonverbal communication systems, unlike the Western culture, which is highly verbal (Roland, 1991; Sue & Sue, 1990). Consequently, silence, eye contact, physical distance, and other nonverbal signals constitute a subtle and highly developed form of communication in Asian cultures, and have to be carefully attended to and understood by the group leader.

Abstract = {This study examines Latino/a adolescents' ethnic identities and academic achievement. In open-ended interviews, the high school aged youth employed cultural and nationality explanations for their ethnic label choices. In many cases, they did not commit to a specific label, employing instead language that indexed their fluid, border identities. This study also made use of various academic performance measurements to quantitatively explore relationships between ethnic identity and academic achievement. A cultural dimension to ethnic identity and a bicultural identity emerged as significant predictors of academic performance. However, no single ethnic label had a definitive relationship with academic performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This study illustrates the effect of cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic status (SES), and developmental factors on young minority and majority children's cognitive development. The objective is to study developmental, SES, and linguistic factors affecting the performance of three groups of young children (i.e., monolingual mainstream, monolingual Hispanic, and bilingual Hispanic) in an alternative assessment of cognition and language (i.e., the Qualitative Use of English as Spanish Tasks, QUEST; Gonzalez, 1994,1995). The methodology includes a quasi-experimental design using five independent variables as predictors: language of administration and response for QUEST (English and/or Spanish), low and middle-high SES, age (4 to 9 years of age), and gender. The dependent variable, the children's performance on QUEST, was analyzed using one-way ANOVA and multiple regression models. Results showed the presence of a major pattern indicating that SES, developmental (age), linguistic (i.e., language of administration and response-including code switching and code mixing, and linguistic characteristics of Spanish and English), and cultural factors (content knowledge represented by stimuli) significantly influence monolingual and bilingual children's verbal and non-verbal concept formation processes. Thus, allowing children to use their strongest language and cultural style of communication (including code switching and code mixing) is an important variable in cognitive assessment. Thus, the fact that most language-minority children come from disadvantaged SES backgrounds, rather than they speak Spanish or are limited-English proficient, is the most important variable influencing their performance in cognitive developmental tasks. The most important theoretical contribution was the empirical validation of a complex revised model showing: (1) support for the complex interaction of cognitive, linguistic, and cultural factors influencing verbal and non-verbal concept construction processes measured by alternative assessments; and (2) similarities and differences between monolingual and bilingual children, in comparison to previous findings (Gonzalez, 1991, 1994, 1995; Gonzalez, Bauerle, & Felix-Holt, 1996). Practical contributions of the study for the assessment of young children indicate that the performance of bilingual low SES students, as well as of monolingual children, is affected by the language of administration and response, and cultural attributes of alternative measures of cognitive and language development. The alternative assessment used, QUEST, provided an opportunity for bilingual children to demonstrate how their understanding of different languages and cultures had enhanced their cognitive development. QUEST provided a window to observe the presence of different content cultural knowledge domains learned, and cognitive processes that are nurtured by bilingual and bicultural settings.

Abstract = {This chapter is drawn from a larger ethnographic study (Del Valle, 2002) investigating language and literacy practices in the home and school experiences of three Puerto Rican families living in two Chicago neighborhoods: Humboldt Park and Logan Square. In this chapter, I focus on the contrast between patterns of language, literacy, and learning in the homes of Ana and Sandy, two of my informants. These two young women provide a significant contrast based both on their differing experiences of academic success and on the literacy practices in their homes. Specifically, I contend that Ana's home literacy practices prepared her for academic success, whereas the literacy practices in Sandy's home did not lead her to academic success. Such differences in outcome challenge the commonly held assumption that the presence of literacy in the home always leads to academic success. I explore schooling attitudes, work, oral cultural traditions, and religious literacy for a better understanding of the differences between these two contexts for literacy. I hope this ethnographic study will enhance future studies of Puerto Rican adolescents and their families by providing a definition for the nature and extent of linguistic practices in some U.S. Puerto Rican homes. I hope it will help teachers, educational administrators, and social workers understand the unique ways in which Puerto Ricans learn and use language as a fundamental part of their social development. I also hope that it will help them understand how they can work with the skills and knowledge the student brings into the classroom to help transform the U.S. Puerto Rican population group now near the bottom of the socioeconomic and educational scale into a bicultural and viable part of the larger society.

Taking it as axiomatic that everyone is entitled to a fair trial, suggestions are made about how the legal process may deal with this by drawing on the skills of interpreters and bicultural workers. A brief review of the relevant research on working with interpreters is given with the aim of assisting organizations in developing guidelines for good practice. Various models of interpretation are reviewed and related issues considered, such as whether interpreters should merely interpret the spoken word or play a role in interpreting important cultural meanings and variables that may bear upon the legal-psychological issues in question. The chapter also considers issues relating to employing interpreters, as well as the roles, rights, and responsibilities of interpreters, legal representatives, and clinicians who may work alongside them. Some suggestions are offered about how these professionals can better work together and be better integrated into the legal system; these are followed by some general guidelines about working with interpreters.

Abstract = {Cervical cancer occurs more frequently among Vietnamese Americans than women of any other race/ethnicity. In addition, previous studies in California have documented low Papanicolaou (Pap) testing rates in Vietnamese communities. This study focused on health care system factors and physician characteristics associated with recent cervical cancer screening among Vietnamese women. A population-based survey was conducted in Seattle during 2002. In-person interviews were conducted by bilingual, bicultural female survey workers. The survey response rate was 82% and 518 women were included in the analysis. Seventy-four percent of the respondents reported having been screened for cervical cancer on at least one occasion, and 64% reported a Pap smear within the previous 2 years. Women with a regular doctor were more likely to have been recently screened than those without a regular doctor (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.45-3.74). Among those with a regular doctor, having a male physician, receiving care at a private doctor's office (rather than a community, hospital, or multi-specialty clinic), and concern about the cost of health care were independently associated with lower screening rates. Physician ethnicity was not associated with recent Pap smear receipt. The findings support targeted interventions for Vietnamese women without a regular physician and private doctors' offices that serve Vietnamese Americans. The availability of low cost screening services should be publicized in Vietnamese communities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: Using the life stress model of psychological well-being, in this study we examined risks and resources predicting the occurrence of both positive and negative affect among older Asian Indian immigrants who experienced stressful life events. Design and Methods: We collected data through a telephone survey of 226 respondents (aged 50 years and older) in the Southeastern United States. We used hierarchical, negative binomial regression analyses to examine correlates of positive and negative affect. Results: Different coping resources influenced positive and negative affect when stressful life events were controlled for. Being female was a common risk factor for poorer positive and increased negative affect. Satisfaction with friendships and a cultural or ethnic identity that is either bicultural or more American were predictive of greater positive affect. Greater religiosity and increased mastery were resources predicting less negative affect. Implications: Cognitive and structural interventions that increase opportunities for social integration, increasing mastery, and addressing spiritual concerns are discussed as ways of coping with stress to improve the well-being of individuals in this immigrant community.

Abstract = {Presents a technique that extracts individual models of social behavior. Such models reflect each individual's ideas about what social behaviors are interrelated, and what aspects of social situations are linked to different levels of probability that particular patterns of social behavior will occur. The method was used in 2 studies, one with bicultural Ss (1 American, 6 Latin Americans, 2 Hong Kong Chinese, and 1 Greek) and the other with 22 monocultural Mexican and Chinese Ss and 8 of the bilinguals from the 1st study. For each S, factor analysis of the judgments concerning the probability of occurrence of specific social behaviors in specific social situations provided information of how the S linked social behaviors. ANOVA on the factor scores provided information about the S's beliefs concerning how attributes of social situations are linked to social behaviors. Inspection of the individual models of social behavior indicated that some common elements across models are probably linked to culture. The technique has wide applicability for social and personality psychology because it permits idiographic comparison of models of social behavior across individuals who share some attribute.

Abstract = {Discusses methods of assessing British bilingual children in order to ascertain (1) whether they have developed the interpersonal communications skills and the literacy-related skills necessary for their placement in an all English-speaking class, and (2) whether any failure to develop skills in English is due only to differences between the language spoken at home and that spoken in the classroom or to an actual learning disability. Hypothetical construct tests of general ability have been shown to be culturally biased, yet many educational psychologists still rely on these tests to determine the placement of bicultural children. Learning ability tests were developed to overcome this cultural bias, but this bias recurs in such factors as significance of the test to the child, motivation to complete the test, and the materials used. Further efforts to remove linguistic bias through the elimination of verbal interactions from such tests only succeed in making the tests less analogous to the classroom situation. Criterion-referenced tests have been developed to determine the rate of learning in the classroom. However, the success of such tests depends on the teacher knowing what the student has learned and what needs to be taught next. When the teacher or educational psychologist has sufficient background information on the bicultural child, assessment may be more accurate.

Abstract = {36 male Chicano undergraduates participated in a small group discussion composed of 4 members: a naive S who invariably served as group leader and 3 confederates representing distinct ethnic groups (Anglo, Black, and Chicano). Ss were selected on the basis of their scores on the Biculturalism Inventory. Behavioral observations revealed several interactions involving group support. High biculturals, in comparison to low biculturals, adopted a more active leader role in nonsupportive than in supportive groups, asking for more opinions and evaluations, and making more clarification statements. While low-bicultural externals and high-bicultural internals tended to be more interpersonally assertive and to make more clarification statements under supportive conditions, it was low-bicultural internals and high-bicultural externals who exhibited the most active leader roles in nonsupportive groups. Additional findings reveal that statements made by the Anglo confederate were clarified more often in the supportive condition, while statements made by either the Black or the Chicano confederate were clarified more often in the nonsupportive condition. Results are discussed in relation to previous literature and the need to develop a more responsive social psychology of interethnic dynamics.

Abstract = {This study investigated the prevalence of back pain, disability, and, of most importance, the presence of misconceptions about low back pain (LBP), its diagnosis and treatment in a bicultural community sample (Belgium). Using the Graded Chronic Pain Scale [Pain 50 (1992) 133] persons were classified according to pain intensity and disability in five subgroups. The interrelationship between LBP beliefs and these five subgroups was also investigated. In our sample (n = 1624) the 6-month prevalence of low back pain was 41.8%. Only in 8.2% back pain was disabling. Misconceptions about back pain were widespread, even in the group reporting no back pain. The least misconceptions were found to exist in participants with mild LBP without disability. It is suggested that recovery from an episode of acute low back pain is an active process that involves a correction of beliefs about harm, about the need to restrict physical activities and about medical diagnosis and cure. Finally, it is argued that community actions may be useful to correct LBP myths in order to prevent the development of long-term disability due to LBP.

This will lead to the development of a curriculum suitable for Native American nurses. Design: A qualitative, descriptive design was used for this study. Focus groups were conducted in Poison, Montana. A total of 67 Native and non-Native nurses participated. Sixty-seven percent of them were members of Indian tribes. Data were content analyzed using Spradley's ethnographic methodology. Findings: Three domains of analysis emerged: point of reference for the leader (individual, family, community), what a leader is (self-actualized, wise, experienced, political, bicultural, recognized, quiet presence, humble, spiritual, and visionary), and what a leader does (mentors, role models, communicates, listens, demonstrates values, mobilizes, and inspires). Discussion: Native nurse leaders lead differently. Thus, a leadership curriculum suitable for Native nurses may lead to increased work productivity and therefore improved patient care for Native Americans.

Abstract = {In this article, the authors report an investigation of the relationship between terror management and social identity processes by testing for the effects of social identity salience on worldview validation. Two studies, with distinct populations, were conducted to test the hypothesis that mortality salience would lead to worldview validation of values related to a salient social identity. In Study 1, reasonable support for this hypothesis was found with bicultural Aboriginal Australian participants (N=97). It was found that thoughts of death led participants to validate ingroup and reject outgroup values depending on the social identity that had been made salient. In Study 2, when their student and Australian identities were primed, respectively, Anglo-Australian students (N=119) validated values related to those identities, exclusively. The implications of the findings for identity-based worldview validation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The process of becoming a mother in an adopted land presents unique challenges in identity formation of immigrant mothers. The bidirectional influence of the mother's own transformation and that of the larger family system has significant implications for child development. This article addresses the ways in which cultural displacement has an impact on the dilemmas of motherhood, as evident in adaptation to the immigration process, changing conceptions of gender roles and attachment, bicultural conflicts, and changing family structure and social network. Mothers' attempts to integrate the old and the new cultural frameworks are explored, particularly in the context of psychotherapy. Clinical cases are discussed to illustrate the intrapsychic and interpersonal conflicts faced by immigrant mothers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the utility of Consumer Notes Clinical Indicators (CNCI) as a means to monitor mental health nursing clinical practice against the Australian and New Zealand College of Mental Health Nurses' (ANZCMHN) Standards of Practice for mental health nursing in New Zealand. CNCI are statements describing pivotal mental health nursing behaviours for which evidence can be found in the nurses' case notes. This paper presents 25 valid and reliable CNCI that can be used to monitor mental health nursing practice against the ANZCMHN's Standards of Practice for mental health nursing in New Zealand. The bicultural clinical indicators were generated in focus groups of Maori and non-Maori mental health nurses, prioritized in a three-round reactive Delphi survey of expert mental health nurses and consumers, pilot tested, and applied in a national field study. This paper reports the development and validation of the CNCI, for which achievement is assessed by an audit of the nursing documentation in consumer case notes. The CNCI were tested in a national field study of 327 sets of consumer case notes at 11 District Health Board sites. The results of the national field study show wide variation in occurrence of individual indicators, particularly in the areas of informed consent, information about legal rights, and provision of culturally safe and recovery-focused care. We discuss the implications of using the CNCI to assess the professional accountability of mental health nurses to provide quality care. Recommendations are made regarding the application of the clinical indicators and future research required, determining appropriate benchmarks for quality practice. The CNCI could be adapted for application in other mental health nursing and other mental health professional clinical settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The feasibility of a 9-month educational diabetes programme (tailored to Turkish patients, provided by Turkish bicultural female educators) was assessed in terms of dropout rate, patient and GP satisfaction, and GP's perceived workload. Of the 54 Turkish patients (39% males) that signed informed consent, 45 actually started the education. Dropout rate during the programme was 41% (main reason: going abroad for a long period (18%)). The individual education sessions and the consultations with the GP were highly appreciated by 87% of the patients and the group sessions by 66%. Although all nine interviewed GPs experienced a higher workload, overall appreciation of the programme was high in six GPs. Although implementation of an ethic-specific diabetes programme in general practice is well appreciated by both patients and GPs, the high dropout rate indicates that the programme needs to be more finely tuned to the individual patient.

Abstract = {Prior findings of strict control of middle-class Estonian mothers have not been consistent with middle-class parent-child interaction patterns reported in other studies. The current study sought to find out to what degree the tendency to be more controlling toward children can be explained by the Estonian mothers' own experience of growing up in a totalitarian society. With this aim, measures of maternal controlling attitudes and actual verbal control of children were employed in a second country with a similar history of Soviet occupation--Latvia--and compared with previous data on Estonian, Finnish, and Swedish mono- and bicultural mothers. The questionnaire data revealed that Estonian (including Swedish-Estonian) and Latvian mothers placed higher emphasis on controlling children than did Finnish and Swedish mothers. At the same time, in their real-life interactions, only Estonian mothers living in Estonia exhibited a highly directive conversational style. Finally, the discussion focuses on possible reasons for cultural variability in maternal controlling attitudes and actual control of children.

Abstract = {A bilingual model has been applied to educating deaf students who are learning American Sign Language (ASL) as their first language and written English as a second. Although Cummins's (1984) theory of second-language learning articulates how learners draw on one language to acquire another, implementing teaching practices based on this theory, particularly with deaf students, is a complex, confusing process. The purposes of the present study were to narrow the gap between theory and practice and to describe the teaching and learning strategies used by the teachers and parents of three elementary school children within a bilingual/bicultural learning environment for deaf students. The findings suggest that strategies such as using ASL as the language of instruction and making translation conceptual rather than literal contribute to literacy learning. Findings further indicate that some inconsistencies persist in applying a bilingual approach with deaf students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Using semi-structured interviews, data were collected from the women and from the helping professionals who provided direct service to the women and who were working in collaboration with the advocate. The findings showed that the advocacy intervention was perceived as useful and effective.

Participants were 151 husbands and wives who were recruited from a health maintenance organization in northern California and individually interviewed. More acculturated husbands and wives engaged in less avoidance of conflict and were more expressive of their feelings in an argument. Husbands who were more acculturated reported more conflict concerning sex and consideration for the other. Bicultural and more acculturated husbands reported that their wives were more verbally and physically aggressive, compared with mono-Mexican husbands. The findings provide evidence that more acculturated husbands and wives are involved in more direct expressions of conflict in their marriages, compared with less acculturated husbands and wives.

Abstract = {In 1991, the Bilingual Bicultural Education Program (BBEP) was launched in Chihuahua, Mexico, as a way of responding to the educational needs of the indigenous Tarahumara populations and the growing threat to their language and culture. Using a conceptual framework based on the literatures of curriculum inquiry, language shift and maintenance, and literacy studies, this 10-month ethnographic case study examines the sociocultural contexts of the implementation of the BBEP in a federal school serving Tarahumara and the role of the school and the BBEP in indigenous language maintenance. Specifically, the paper reports and discusses findings on how state-developed BBEP goals relate to the teachers' and parents' expectations of school and literacy and biliteracy. As the findings show, the school is the place of children's first intense contact with mestizo culture and language and the agency where children are expected by parents and teachers to acquire Spanish oral and literacy skills.

Abstract = {It is anticipated that this chapter will add to the literature through an integrated, Chicana-focused presentation. Moreover, although the topic is psychotherapy, there is a much broader landscape to be introduced into the discussion. To accomplish this, I draw upon several personal motivators, including a long-standing fascination with mujeres (women) Mejicanas and Chicanas who transcended the odds stacked against them, clinical work with Chicanas from varying backgrounds for nearly 20 years, delivery of workshops and other presentations to Chicanas and other Latinas on the topic of mujeres Latinas, developing and teaching a graduate course, "Counseling Latina/os," and reading and creating new publications about Chicanas and Latinas. Why another chapter? To date, we do not have a sufficiently broad body of research exploring the strengths of Chicanas. To understand the Chicana from a strength versus deficit perspective, multiple contexts must be examined. There are the contexts of la familia y la comunidad (the family and the community) and the norms transmitted there about female values and morals. In society, a Chicana must move across different settings alongside similar and different others. Classrooms, work places, churches and temples, recreational settings, and la casa (the home) are all domains and spaces with multiple requirements and expectations for Chicanas. Even if it appears as though there is a script that la mujer can or should follow, the emotional, physical, and spiritual stress will not allow for easy answers. The objective of this chapter is to illustrate the between-borders experiences of Chicanas who participated in therapy. From these examples, numerous themes emerge about beliefs and value orientations, various dimensions of identity, developmental tasks, and cultural landscapes. These various streams in the landscape further relate to cultural refraining for the purposes of culturally informed and ethical assessment, diagnosis, and intervention planning. It is hoped that the recommendations made will allow for a juxtaposition to the Eurocentric medical model templates regarding psychological well-being and offer new ways of framing the varying persona(s) of Chicanas. Though the therapy examples are not numerous, they illustrate the tensions and delicacy of being a bicultural woman in a society that does not believe that culture counts. Furthermore, the cases invite exploration of issues and concepts from a culture-centered perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

The text charts the 'successes' and 'failures' of the Rough Rock Demonstration School (Rough Rock) as it struggles to keep true to its original mission of cultivating local leadership, developing the local economy, and promoting Navajo language and culture. Rough Rock created one of the first community-based, indigenous bilingual/bicultural programmes. It has developed a wide range of teaching and reading materials in Navajo, helping to start a grassroots language policy movement. Also, it has nurtured and empowered indigenous educators who have gone on to assume leadership positions in a range of organisations working for indigenous education control. The author captures these ups and downs and much more in this ethnographic 'critical life history', the label she has thoughtfully applied to this book written in partnership with the Rough Rock community.

Abstract = {Reviews the book "Intercultural Experience and Education," edited by G. Aired, M, Byram and M. Fleming (2002). The collection emphasizes the need to view culture apart from individual actions but through a self-reflective lens; the importance of incorporating interculturality into pedagogy. In the first chapter, or Introduction, the authors establish a clear need to bring the notion of intercultural competence beyond the boundaries of training programs and specific areas of education. The goals they outline and their perspective of interculturality as a dynamic experience are a logical extension of earlier work by these authors in which various approaches to pedagogy, assessment, and experiences abroad have addressed affective needs and personal growth. As a collection, these chapters inform our understanding of interculturality as a potentially powerful force in shaping and changing individual identities. The consistent use of the authors' personal experiences, excerpts from journals, and interviews with students and intercultural/bicultural persons gives this volume a rich, contextualised vision. The book fits in well with current conversations about the nature of self-reflection and identity formation in intercultural studies and language learning.

Abstract = {This study examined the potential effects of INH side effects and non-specific somatic complaints on medication adherence in 96 Latino adolescents participating in a controlled trial designed to increase isoniazid (INH) adherence. These participants (who received usual medical care) were interviewed monthly over 9 months. Participants were questioned regarding medication taking, the frequency of 15 INH-related side effects from the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR), and 21 non-specific somatic complaints. Participants were aged 12-19 years, 53.1% were male, 66.7% were born in Mexico, 73% had no health insurance, and 52.5% were classified as bicultural. Approximately 70% of participants experienced at least one side effect during the trial. Side effects that occurred while taking INH were not significantly related to total number of pills taken; somatic complaints that occurred during 9 months of INH were significantly negatively related to cumulative adherence. Females reported significantly more somatic complaints at baseline than males. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {An epidemiological study in Los Angeles showed that Chinese Americans had lower rates of depression compared to the U.S. national estimates. This study surveys the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) among Asian-Americans in the primary care setting. A two-phase epidemiological survey was performed in the primary care clinic of a community health center in Boston, MA, which provides treatment to under-served Asian-Americans. The Chinese version of the Beck Depression Inventory (CBDI) was used for initial screening. All consenting patients who screened positive (CBDI ≥ 16) and a fraction of those who screened negative (CBDI < 16) were interviewed by a bilingual and bicultural psychiatrist with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, patient version, for confirmation of the diagnosis of MDD. There were 815 in the primary care clinic that were approached, of which 503 patients filled out the CBDI in the initial phase of depression screening. Extrapolating the results from the SCID-P interviews, the prevalence of MDD among Asian-Americans in the primary care setting was estimated to be 19.6% ± 0.06. MDD is common among Asian-Americans in primary care settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Students have travelled from one country to another for centuries, particularly in Europe. They have often faced problems: an early study in America, published in 1925, listed difficulties for foreign students over academic issues, language, housing, economic issues, their inability to become socially accepted, health and recreation, and racial prejudice. But it was not until comparatively recently that the foreign student experience became the focus of psychological study. In many cases foreign students do appear to experience more physical and mental ill health than native students, as well as more academic problems. Although there are no grand theories attempting to explain this phenomenon, various concepts have been put forward to predict the quality, quantity and chronicity of sojourner distress. One such concept is the culture-distance concept, which states simply that the absolute amount of difference or distance (defined both objectively and subjectively) between a sojourner's own and the host culture is directly proportionally related to the amount of stress or difficulty experienced. Various friendship networks (monocultural, bicultural, multicultural) serve important psychological functions, which in turn help a sojourner over numerous difficulties.

Abstract = {The authors propose a model of cultural trauma and revitalization. The theory suggests a framework for understanding disruptions that an "original" culture might suffer at the imposition of an "arriving" culture resulting in vulnerabilities of individuals, families/small groups, communities, and the larger societies. The cultural clash model posits that original cultures have identifiable and sustainable economic, social, political, and spiritual systems in the pre-contact era. Exposure to an arriving culture can radically alter the character and sustainability of the original culture. Emergence from the challenge can lead to cultural dissolution, but there can also be revitalization and reorganization. This can occur if the injured culture lays claim to economic and social resources, preferably with the support and encouragement of the hegemonic culture. The end result can be a form of bicultural or multicultural adaptation by the members of the original culture. Suggestions for testing the model of cultural trauma are offered by using culturally relevant variables in path analysis or structural equation modeling. The article closes with a discussion of issues related to individual, small group, community, and societal interventions following cultural loss and trauma.

Participants (n = 286) were randomly assigned to adherence coaching, attention control, or usual care groups. Adherence was measured via interviews and validated with urine assays. Results. Coaching resulted in significant increases in adherence compared with attention and usual care groups. Bicultural adolescents were more likely to be adherent than those most or least acculturated. Age and risk behavior were negatively related to adherence. Conclusions. Coaching can increase Latino adolescents' adherence to treatment for latent tuberculosis infection and should contribute to tuberculosis control for adolescents at high risk of contracting the disease.

Abstract = {Three of the basic goals of immigrants in multicultural societies--maintenance of heritage culture, participation in the host society, and maintenance of psychological and physical health--were examined as outcome variables in a proposed individual difference model of the acculturation process. The three composite predictor variables in the model were psychosocial adjustment, consisting of psychological well-being, bicultural competence, and perceived outgroup social support; connectedness to family and culture, consisting of family allocentrism, ethnic identity, and perceived ingroup support; and the experience of acculturation-specific and non-specific daily hassles. The roles of separation and assimilation modes of acculturation were also examined. The research participants were 85 male and 81 female Iranian immigrants to Canada. Their median age was 34 years. Psychosocial adjustment was directly related to outgroup behavior and to psychophysical distress. Connectedness to family and culture was directly related to ingroup behavior, and daily hassles were directly related to psychophysical distress. Each of these predictor variables was associated with either or both modes of acculturation. In turn, these modes of acculturation predicted the outcome behavior variables.

Abstract = {The article aims to investigate in an Australian study of immigrant women conducted 6--9 months following childbirth (a) the associations of a range of demographic, obstetric, health and social context variables with maternal depression, and (b) women's views of contributing factors in their experiences of depression. Design. Three hundred and eighteen Vietnamese, Turkish and Filipino women participated in personal interviews conducted by three bicultural interviewers in the language of the women's choice. The issues most commonly identified by women in this study as contributing to depression are similar to those found previously for Australian-born women: isolation (in this study, including being homesick)--29%; lack of support and marital issues--25%; physical ill-health and exhaustion--23%; family problems--19%, and baby-related issues--17%. There were some differences in the importance of these among the three country-of-birth groups, but all except family issues were in the top four contributing factors mentioned by women in all groups. Conclusions. These findings support the evidence for quite marked cross-cultural similarity in the associations of maternal depression and in women's views about their experiences.

Abstract = {The objective was to test whether theoretical variables predict adherence to treatment for latent tuberculosis infection in high-risk Latino adolescents. 286 Latino adolescents (aged 13-18 yrs), were recruited from 10 middle/high schools in San Diego County, San Diego, US. Participants completed a baseline interview and up to 9 mo interviews. The cumulative number of pills consumed in 9 mo was regressed on 16 independent variables, entered hierarchically in seven blocks. The final model accounted for 25% of the variance in adherence to isoniazid (INH). Adherence counseling (+), age (-), grades (+), being bicultural (+), and risk behaviors (-) were significantly related to adherence. Learning theories presume that adherence to medical regimens requires social support and freedom from physical and social barriers. Results support these theories. Future studies should explore additional precepts in order to identify additional predictors and to maximize adherence to INH among Latino adolescents and other high-risk populations. Doing so should decrease the risk of active TB among high-risk racial/ethnic and foreign-born populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to test the reliability and validity of a Spanish translation of the Resilience Scale (RS), which was originally created in English by Wagnild and Young (1993). A team of bilingual, bicultural translators participated in the translation process to enhance the linguistic accuracy and cultural appropriateness of the Spanish translation. As part of the convenience sample of 315 women of Mexican descent who participated in the larger study, data from 147 women who preferred to read and write in Spanish were used in this analysis. The English version of the RS consists of a 17-item "Personal Competence" subscale and an 8-item "Acceptance of Self and Life" subscale for a total of 25 items. However, two items had low item-total loadings and were removed to form a modified 23-item RS. The exploratory principal components factor analysis, varimax rotation, and subsequent goodness of fit indices were ambivalent on whether a one or two-factor solution was appropriate, but the chi-square difference test clearly demonstrated that the two-factor solution of the Spanish version was more useful in explaining variance than a one-factor solution. Internal consistency reliability was estimated with Cronbach's alpha (α=0.93) which was acceptable for the 23-item RS as well as its subscales. Construct validity was demonstrated by a significant positive correlation between resilience and life satisfaction (r=0.36; p<0.001), and a significant negative correlation between resilience and depressive symptoms (r=-0.29; p<0.01). This analysis ultimately supports the appropriateness of the modified 23-item Spanish translation of the RS and its subscales in a sample of urban, low-income women of Mexican descent in the U.S. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Parents and teachers were eligible to receive psychoeducation and support services. Results show that students in the intervention group (n=152) had significantly greater improvement in posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms compared with those on the waitlist (n=47) at 3-mo follow-up, adjusting for relevant covariates. A collaborative research team of school clinicians, educators, and researchers developed this trauma-focused CBT program for Latino immigrant students and their families. This pilot test demonstrated that this program for traumatized youths, designed for delivery on school campuses by school clinicians, can be implemented and evaluated in the school setting and is associated with a modest decline in trauma-related mental health problems.

Abstract = {The psychology of intercultural adaptation was first discussed by Plato. Many modern enculturation theories claim that ethnic minorities (including aboriginal natives, immigrants, refugees, and sojourners) can favor either the dominant culture, or their own minority culture, or both, or neither. Between 1918 and 1984, 68 such theories showed varied and inconsistent terminology, poor citation of earlier research, conflicting and poorly tested predictions of acculturative stress, and lack of logic, for example, 2 cultures in contact logically allow 16 types of acculturation, not just 4. Logic explains why assimilation = negative chauvinism = marginality, why measures of incompatible acculturative attitudes can be positively correlated, and why bicultural integration and marginalisation are confounded constructs. There is no robust evidence that biculturalism is most adaptive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Examined maternal control of children across families with early adolescents from different sociocultural backgrounds. The intention was to find out whether belonging to the same ethnic group/language community is more important for determination of childrearing attitudes and practices than sharing the immediate sociocultural context. In addition, attention was paid to the relationship between attitudes and behaviour. The results were obtained from three monocultural samples of Estonian, Swedish, and Finnish families living in their country of origin; two bicultural samples consisted of Estonian and Finnish families residing in Sweden. Two types of data--mothers' reported attitudes towards the importance of control over children's behaviour and video-recorded real-life verbal behaviour were used to determine how the mothers' attitudes towards control relate to the behavioural control exhibited in their real-life interactions. The study showed that the Finno-Ugric mothers living in their countries of origin controlled their children's behaviour significantly more frequently than those Finno-Ugric mothers who live in Sweden, but both Estonian samples outperformed Finns in their reported control attitudes...

Abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to provide insight into how social services can be more effective in promoting resilience in the Latino population by drawing from the personal, cultural, and social strengths of this community. To do so, we will analyze the stories of Latinos in the United States, the difficulties they experience, and the strengths they develop in the process of becoming part of their new country. By describing the Latino experience of immigration and their transformation into bicultural individuals, we want to contribute to the understanding of the specific factors that allow resilience to develop. The conceptual framework considers resilience as a social phenomenon, and shows that extended family support, oral traditions, optimism, and cultural attachment, among other factors, can be used by social services to promote resilience in the Latino population.

A subset consented to help evaluate the program. 47 women completed baseline and 38 completed follow-up surveys. Study participants (aged 23-73 yrs) reported high adherence to mammography screening guidelines, but lower than optimal adherence to clinical breast examination and monthly breast self-examination guidelines. While less than half of the women felt they had enough knowledge about breast cancer, nearly all indicated that they would be willing to share any knowledge they gained with loved ones and that their loved ones would be receptive to their information.

Abstract = {People who grow up in one place and move in early adulthood or later to another country, adopt its customs, and learn its language, offer a unique window into the effects of language and culture on autobiographical memory. From the perspective of autobiographical memory, immigration occasions profound changes. In a crude cognitive sense, there are two of "something" here: two sets of mental organizations and two contexts of encoding and retrieval. Nevertheless, translating the complex experience of immigration into the language of cognitive and psycholinguistic experiment has not been an easy task because the sociocultural, linguistic, and cognitive factors seem too many and the directions of influence too diffuse. Nevertheless, by devising more sophisticated concepts of language, culture, and memory, it is possible to bring bilingual-bicultural autobiographical memory into focus. This chapter addresses the issue in five steps. It begins (first) with a description of the bilingual experience of having different senses of the self and of the world in either language. Because identity is tied to one's memory for who one is and what one has done in the past, this leads (second) to an examination of bilingual autobiographical memory done in more formal studies: a consideration of bilingual retrieval of memories in psychotherapy and a review of some current experimental work on bilingual recollection. Giving an adequate account of these findings requires a revision of the notions of language and memory in current research. Therefore (third), a discussion of language moves from the notion of a decontextualized code to the interweaving of language and culture in "linguacultures" (Attinasi & Friedrich, 1995). A consideration of memory retrieval (fourth) suggests a shift from an emphasis on atomistic mnemonic traces to multimodal narrative wholes. These theoretical considerations make it possible to offer a more fruitful approach to bilingual autobiographical memory (fifth) by advocating a linguacultural view of the encoded experience and corresponding language-specific retrieval.

The potential adverse consequences of AOD abuse on Indian adolescents include higher involvement with the juvenile justice system, increased mental health problems, and lower educational achievement. In addition, parental AOD abuse may lead to increased levels of child maltreatment and family problems that can potentially compound the risk for juvenile system involvement, mental health or educational problems, and youth involvement in AOD abuse. Our Youth Our Future Inc provides services for AI/AN adolescents. The cultural-spiritual program provides cultural teachings and activities that foster cultural pride, identity, and values, and enhance the effort for sobriety and recovery. The bicultural treatment model combines cognitive-behavioral and biopsychosocial treatment approaches with an integrated program of culturally relevant practices and activities that compliment the rehabilitative effort of each youth.

Abstract = {An analysis of the most recent self-study reports of the 46 teacher preparation programs approved by the Council on Education of the Deaf yielded data on program demographics, curriculum and content, faculty, practicum, students, and graduates. Only 4 of the 46 teacher preparation programs had been established since 1980. Thirty-nine offered comprehensive teacher preparation, five offered auditory/oral, and two offered preparation in bilingual-bicultural education. Thirty-three offered two or more specializations, of which elementary (96%) and secondary (52%) were the most common. Students' practicum experiences often did not coincide with employment after graduation. The study reported a median of 2 full-time faculty per program, who taught 75% of the courses. Although adjuncts taught 25% of the courses in the deaf education program, they made up 75% of the faculty. The study's results indicate extreme diversity among the programs and great breadth and complexity within them. Compared with a 1986 survey, the number and level of the programs appears to be declining while the number of specializations and program length are increasing.

Mothers in a New Country was a study of 318 Vietnamese, Turkish, and Filipino women interviewed about their maternity care experiences by bicultural interviewers 6 months after giving birth in Melbourne, Australia. The interview schedule was adapted from the 1994 Victorian Survey of Recent Mothers, a population-based postal survey of 1,336 women. Of the 3 groups, 27 percent of Vietnamese, 48 percent of Turkish, and 39 percent of Filipino women reported their care during labor and birth as "very good," figures significantly lower than for the statewide survey, in which 61 percent of women experiencing similar models of care described their care as "very good." This significant differential in views about care was also present for many individual aspects of care. What immigrant women wanted from their maternity care proved to be extremely similar to what Australian-born women--and women the world over--want.

Abstract = {A sample of 157 Korean immigrants 81 men and 76 women, aged 19-70 yrs) responded to measures of acculturation level, stress from acculturation, and depressive symptoms. The authors hypothesized that adaptive acculturation would depend on assimilation regarding social interactions and the host culture's language as well as on retention of a core identity, including values and traditions of the culture of origin. Consistent with the mediation hypothesis, acculturation, based on a factor representing language use and social relationships, was related to lower acculturative stress and, in turn, lower depression. However, there was no direct support for the integrative, or bicultural, strategy of acculturation. Stress did not mediate the effect of a 2nd acculturation factor, identity and tradition-based acculturation. Rather, this measure of acculturation was directly related to higher depression (i.e., immigrants reporting abandonment of Korean identity, traditions, and values scored higher for depression).

Demographic variables, acculturation level, and amount of contact opportunity were used to predict perceived discrimination using multiple hierarchical logistic analyses. Approximately 21% of Chinese Americans reported being unfairly treated in their lifetime. The specific predictors varied depending on whether the discrimination was due to race and ethnicity, or language and accent. Retention of cultural practices, age of immigration, and contact opportunity were associated with racial discrimination. Only contact opportunity was associated with language and accent discrimination.

This article is about what Asian American therapists at one ethnic-specific clinic reported about their practices with their clients and what they believed their clients thought about mental illness and treatment. Three major areas of concern emerged: mental illness beliefs, treatment beliefs, and therapeutic relationships. Findings indicated that ethnic-specific services require more than the bilingual/bicultural matching of therapist and client, but entail constant negotiations between therapist and client and also the types of services provided. In addition, therapists reported a culturally congruent match between themselves and their ethnic-specific clinic, indicating a broader aspect of the cultural match thesis.

Students completed measures of cultural adjustment (Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire), anxiety and trauma (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, Trauma Symptom Checklist), self-esteem (Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and coping ability esteem (Coping Scale for Children and Adolescents). The main findings from this study indicate that culturally diverse groups residing in Australia vary in their experience of cultural adaptation, level of self-esteem, and symptoms of emotional distress, illustrating culture-specific strengths and weaknesses among young non-English speaking (NESB) students.

This chapter underlines the point that scoring high on a measure of adherence to the native culture does not necessarily mean rejection of the dominant culture. Rather, it suggests that a bicultural approach measuring the degree of adoption of elements of both cultures should be the goal. The author also calls for a multidimensional approach to the measurement of acculturation and suggests that more attention be given to developing a measure of the dominant American culture. He cautions against the inclusion of items that relate childhood practices that do not therefore change over time, as such items compromise the ability to examine the process of acculturation over time.

Abstract = {There is limited research, both conceptual and empirical, that examines the acculturation process of immigrants, the ethnic identification process of children of immigrants, and the effects of such adaptations on their stress-related mental health. This chapter attempts to address these issues conceptually and in measurement terms with regard to Asian Americans. Acculturation involves a minority individual's behavioral, cultural, and social adaptations that take place as a result of contact between the individual's ethnic society and the White dominant society. Acculturative stress is the direct result of the acculturation adaptation process for first generation immigrants, and bicultural stress is a response to the pulls of maintaining ethnic ties in second and later generations. Moderating variables, such as generational status, differentially impact these processes. Empirical studies have measured these variables individually, in isolation of the other related cultural variables. It is suggested that now that there is a broader picture of acculturation, more complex measurement models can be hypothesized and tested.

Abstract = {The Five-Factor Model is a prominent exemplar of the trait psychology perspective. Research indicates that the trait psychology perspective provides a viable theoretical basis for understanding Filipino personality and behavior. Structure-oriented studies in the Philippines using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) indicate that the Five-Factor Model generalizes well to the Philippine context, particularly when targeted factor rotations are used. In a study of mean trait levels with the NEO-PI-R, hypotheses about average cultural differences between Filipinos and Americans derived from the literature converged well with the personality comparison judgments of 43 bicultural judges. However, the resulting predictions of average cultural differences received only limited or partial support in an examination of Filipino mean profiles on the NEO-PI-R, plotted using U.S. norms. These results highlighted the uncertain nature of direct score comparisons, and concerns about measurement equivalence, in investigations of mean differences in personality traits across cultures.

Abstract = {The paper arises from Pakeha attempts to deal with bicultural responsiveness in Aotearoa, New Zealand, and represents the application of a social constructionist conceptual framework to practical issues faced by counsellors working around cultural difference. It seeks to de-construct some of the assumptions made in discourses around difference through exploration of the language through, and by which, we make cross-cultural connections. Readers are invited to consider the relationship of text to ethos, and the relationship of the words we use to the space between the words. It is suggested that the power of this in-between space, this chora (Kristeva, 1980), is related to the expression of culture. The paper aims to present a challenge to those who at times wonder about the ethics and efficacy of their counselling profession in relation to their desire to create a better world--in particular in redressing the inequities which invariably exist between different cultures. It is proposed that counselling as a discourse technology is a powerful tool for change. However, as a marketable technology, forms of discourse need constant monitoring since certain forms of language can be both colonised and colonising. Colonisation, with its implications of dominance and exploitation, is seen as incompatible with counselling values. Consideration is given to three aspects of discourse worthy of consideration for those working for change: ethos, individual ownership and nominalisation.

This study used 1990 Census data on 18-21 yr old youths to analyze how language use, household language, and presence of immigrants in the household affect dropping out of school. Results indicate that these measures have similar effects on these diverse groups: bilingual students are less likely to drop out than English-only speakers, students in bilingual households are less likely to drop out than those in English-dominant or English-limited households, and students in immigrant households are less likely to drop out than those in nonimmigrant households. These findings suggest that those who enjoy the greatest educational success are not those who have abandoned their ethnic cultures and are most acculturated. Rather, bicultural youths who can draw resources from both the immigrant community and mainstream society are best situated to enjoy educational success.

This article reviews past litigation concerning the education of children who are deaf or hard of hearing and explores the new language of IDEA 97 as it affects communication issues for these children. Arguing that IDEA 97 and the 1999 implementing, regulations make it more difficult for schools to ignore the primary language and preferred mode of communication of children who are deaf, the authors speculate that courts may be less likely to view language and communication modes as educational methods and, therefore, less likely to defer to the decisions of school authorities than in past court cases.

A range of attempts by Pakeha feminist groups to share power with indigenous Maori women are briefly described an reflected upon. From the viewpoint of a Pakeha participant in both feminist and anti-racist work, the author suggests that feminist values and practice may have helped some Pakeha feminists to respond to challenges by Maori women with early attempts at bicultural power sharing in this country. Some feminist organizations radically restructured to share organizational power between Maori and non-Maori women at least a decade before other values-based organizations took similar steps. Although some of the attempts were shortlived, others have been maintained over several decades, and in all cases the participating individuals may have been important carriers of values, principles and skills of power sharing between Pakeha and Maori in to organizational life in Aotearoa/New Zealand.

Abstract = {Determined the association between acculturation, immigration, and prevalence of depression in 1,789 older Mexican Americans (aged 60–100 yrs). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies—Depression scale; acculturation was measured with the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans—II; and psychosocial, behavioral, and medical histories were obtained. The prevalence of depression was 25.4%. Women were at greater risk (32.0%) than men. The prevalence of depression was higher among immigrants (30.4%), bicultural Ss (24.2%), and less-acculturated Ss (36.1%) compared with US-born (20.5%) and more-acculturated Ss (16.1%). When adjustments for education, income, psychosocial, behavioral, and health-problem factors were made, the least-acculturated Ss were at significantly higher risk of depression than highly acculturated Mexican Americans. Findings are consistent with previously reported estimates of a higher prevalence of depression for older Mexican Americans than non-Hispanic Caucasians and African Americans. The high prevalence of depression of the least acculturated group may be related to cultural barriers encountered by immigrants and less-acculturated older Mexican Americans and to poorer health status.

The findings were tested according to the deaf identity development theory and the data were analyzed for internal consistency reliability, item-to-scale reliability, and interscale correlations. Results of these and factor analysis support the existence of 4 relatively independent deaf identities.

Abstract = {This article expounds on practical implications of racial and ethnic identity development models for counseling biracial individuals. Additional life history and demographic information are provided to specify the context in which the client, Mr. X, now seeks counseling. Racial and ethnic identity development models are briefly reviewed, the case is conceptualized, and practice suggestions are discussed. The content contained herein touches on other concepts from the multicultural counseling literature such as bicultural competence and racial and ethnic salience. The author attempts to help counselors think practically about existing models from which to work with this ever-burgeoning yet understudied segment of the US population. Based on the conceptualization of the client, possible assessment and counseling interventions are discussed. A short vignette is provided to help bridge theory to practice with biracial clients.

Abstract = {Evaluates an injury-prevention program for 11–16 yr old Hispanic migrant youth. Authors state that unintentional injuries are the major cause of death among children, adolescents, and young adults. The study uses a randomized controlled trial to study 660 Hispanic adolescent and parent pairs who participated in a program entitled Sembrando Salud (sowing the seeds of health). The intervention consisted of first aid and home safety training or tobacco and alcohol prevention. Both groups were part of an 8-session, multimedia program presented by bilingual, bicultural college students. The sessions consisted of lectures, discussions, and skills development and practice. Participants were assessed at baseline, at immediate post-intervention, and at 1-yr follow-up. After the interventions, both groups experienced greater feelings of self-confidence with respect to first-aid abilities. However, Ss in the first aid and home safety program revealed more positive changes in knowledge and in behavior concerning home safety. They were better able to identify items to include in a first aid kit, and to know how to respond in an emergency situation, and reported fewer erroneous victim-caring procedures than the tobacco and alcohol prevention group.

Abstract = {The Family Mentoring Project, which provided approximately one year of mentoring for at-risk 10-year old Latino children and their parents, aimed to provide not only service but empirical evaluation of the program's impact. This University-community partnership offered individual mentoring, a group educational component for children and parents, and group social/recreational activities. A pre- and post-test analysis of 11 non-mentored and 20 mentored youth revealed positive gains on social skills for mentored children as reflected in self-ratings and mothers' ratings on the Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS). Also based on the SSRS, mothers reported decreases in three problem behaviors for mentored children. In addition, by post-testing, the mentored children and their mothers compared very favorably with the SSRS standardized samples on both skills and problem behaviors. The findings suggest that bicultural competence may be fostered by programs that provide consistent and long-term mentoring, involve the children's families, include group educational components, and bring families and mentors together for social/recreational events.

Abstract = {Writing this chapter has been one of the most difficult tasks that I have undertaken in my career. Except for short "biobibs," I have never written about myself for the purpose of publication and, for that matter, any purpose. While I'm not a shy person, I highly value my privacy, and so sharing my life experiences, and in particular those that relate to my family, is not something I easily do; furthermore, my cultural upbringing underscored the fact that one should not go around "bragging" about one's personal achievements. These reasons aside, I think that the major reason for my seeking to avoid writing this chapter was having to face the emotions, especially the negative ones, that are an inherent part of one's solitary journey through the labyrinth of life. Having undertaken the task to write this chapter I have opted to examine different pathways in my life's journey that, directly or indirectly, brought me to the place in which I presently find myself. I believe that the journey that I have undertaken has been extremely challenging in more ways than one. The paths that I have followed have been bilingual and bicultural, if not tricultural, in nature; they have richly encompassed racial, ethnic, and sexual orientation perspectives. It is my hope that as you read this chapter you will interpret my journey through life from the perspective of such challenges and experiences. As I begin writing, I am faced with the reality that it is too easy to ramble when one is reminiscing about, remembering, and/or reconstructing the past in relationship to one's self. Given the limitations of length, in this chapter, I selectively present memories and recollections of my life in chronological progression. The ones that I have chosen to present are those that I believe have had the most significant impact in getting me here to this place in life in which I presently find myself.

Abstract = {Assuming that the therapist is actively engaged in an ongoing learning process about diverse cultures, this chapter focuses on specific steps he or she can take during an assessment of clients of minority cultures and groups. These steps involve the use of multiple sources of information, including information from health care providers and significant others, and direct and indirect observations. In addition, to facilitate an understanding of the client's personal history, the therapist needs to obtain information about relevant cultural histories and stay aware of changing conceptualizations of illness and health in different cultures. Toward this end, it can be helpful to calculate the eras during which a client experienced significant developmental phases and then think about the sociocultural influences during these time periods. Equally important is the use of a client's preferred language and a deliberate search for culturally related strength at the individual, interpersonal, and environmental levels. The case example of a 40-yr-old bicultural woman who came to counseling for help in coping with chronic pain is presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {I am honored to undertake the challenge of Editor for Art Therapy: Journal of the American Art Therapy Association as it begins its twenty-third year of publication. As Art Therapy faces its twenty-third year, we open a new chapter on the rich and varied history of art therapy ideas, personalities, dreams and struggles from which a profession emerged. We recall the visionaries who established the American Art Therapy Association, its scholarly journal, and research that created the beginnings of shared language, theories, and conceptions of practice. In this issue, readers will find references to the formative past still very much alive in our present: people like the late Joan Kellogg whose mandala studies inspired Phyllis Frame to apply its concepts to art therapy assessment of couples compatibility, commentary on the early history of the profession's formation, Chantel Lumpkin's contemplation of her path to professional identity as detoured by her culture, and Cliff Joseph who draws on his history as a minority art therapist in a politically charged historical time to reflect on the pressing need today for art therapists to become sensitive to the socio-political realities that breed the personal pathologies of their clients. Threaded through these contributions to the professional literature are questions relating to bicultural, assimilated or separated identities that will resonate with many art therapists who are questioning their own identification with a dynamically changing profession in these transitional times. Facing forward, Carol McNamee draws from the research of neuroscience to conceptualize art therapy as increasing bi-lateral brain functioning, bridging art therapy practice with language and concepts of science. Dan Horay introduces art therapists to new models of substance abuse treatment that break with the AA culture and its long-standing assumptions.

Abstract = {Few empirical studies exist that specifically assess the impact of family on the development of cultural identity (Reference Group Orientation = RGO) in individuals of mixed cultural heritage. Moreover, no studies exist involving individuals of dual-minority heritage and the rural Australian, especially the Indigenous experience. In this study, self-narrative (ethnographic interview) of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders with Chinese ancestry reveals the essential position of family in determining an individual's RGO outcome. Virtually all the participants acknowledge that the rich Indigenous cultural life-experience and upbringing provided by their families influenced their development of unquestioned, stable Indigenous RGOs. However, layered problem-free onto their core (Indigenous) RGOs are varying degrees of "other-culture" (here Chinese) identifications. The study argues that the differential impact of past and present government policies across the rural-urban divide has proved an obstacle to the formation of bicultural RGOs in mixed-heritage family members.

Abstract = {Examined the acculturation levels of 99 Vietnamese college students (average age 21 yrs) living in or away from Vietnamese communities. The students, either born in Vietnam or in the US, had received precollege education and entered college in the US. In the study there were 2 instruments used: The Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA) and The Acculturation and Structural Assimilation Scale (ASAS). Results show that the community setting of residency at college was related to the Vietnamese college students' acculturation into US culture. The small size of the acculturation differences between the groups living in the 2 community settings was not surprising, because the respondents had completed most of their acculturation before college. Participants who lived in a Vietnamese community were more acculturated than those who lived in a non-Vietnamese community at college. The Vietnamese students living in a non-Vietnamese community may have more difficulty in being bicultural, which can be viewed as being different. Being different is often associated with being lonely or isolated and may reduce these students' freedom to acculturate. Authors also found that the longer the Vietnamese students had lived in the US, the more acculturated they became. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the impact of a community-based intervention to prevent tobacco and alcohol use on parent–child communication among Hispanic migrant adolescents. 660 families participated in the randomized pre–post study, which also examined effects of adolescent age, gender, and acculturation, and household size. Treatment and control groups completed an 8-session culturally sensitive program presented by bilingual/bicultural college students. Parents attended 3 of the 8 sessions and helped their child complete homework. The intervention included: (1) information about tobacco and alcohol effects, (2) social skills training (i.e., refusal skills), and (3) the development of parent–child communication skills to support healthy youth decisions. Results showed significant intervention by household size interactions for parent and youth perceptions of communication, indicating that the treatment was effective in increasing communication in families with fewer children. Based on the effect size and the previously established relationship between communication and susceptibility to tobacco/alcohol use, it was determined that the intervention effect could mean a future 5–10% decrease in susceptibility for smaller families.

Ellsworth's (see record [rid]1994-97938-002[/rid]) model of emotion appraisal, were used to investigate the relation between acculturation and affect. Asian Americans most and least assimilated to the dominant Anglo American culture were expected to exhibit emotion responses to 4 different vignettes correspondingly similar to and different from those of Anglo Americans. Those with a bicultural or integrationist trajectory should occupy a middle ground in terms of emotional experience. Compared with the appraisal process, ego- versus other-focused emotions, mediated in part by one's self-construal (e.g., independent or interdependent), were more strongly associated with acculturation orientation in the expected directions. The implications of recognizing the influence of acculturation on the emotional meaning of life encounters of newcomers are discussed in light of community psychology and clinical practice.

Clients who are gay, lesbian or bisexual have different life experiences from those of their heterosexual counterparts.

Abstract = {This program, designed for a multi-ethnic classroom setting, uses drawing and storytelling to help 25 immigrant and refugee children build bridges between the past and the future by attaching meaning to experience. Three main themes—family, friends, and myths— run through the children's work. The family represents continuity of attachments and values, friends make up the human environment of the host country, and myths of the homeland seem to provide a framework for experiences and emotions. Expression of these themes appears to indicate not only that these factors can protect against psychological distress, but also the children's ability to adjust to existence in a bicultural world. On the other hand, the time sequence analysis of the stories suggests that an absence of solid ties to the past prevents children from imagining a future for themselves.

Abstract = {Describes the development, conceptualization, and the status of the training, research, and practice of community psychology in other countries, particularly those countries where there is a significant discussion of community psychology and/or a considerable amount of community-oriented work. Three different cultural traditions that bind the countries together have served for grouping them in this chapter. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are primarily English-speaking ex-colonies of Britain, and closest culturally to the US. Italy, Germany, Poland, and Israel share a strong European cultural heritage. Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Mexico, and Cuba are Latin American ex-colonies of Spain, with the direct heritage of the conquest. South Africa is a special case of a bicultural country in the midst of change. This chapter is divided into 5 sections: (1) development of community psychology, (2) current status, (3) conceptual bases and orientation, (4) future prospects, and (5) conclusions. It is based on original pieces first prepared by the collaborating authors in 1986, and has been updated several times through 1992. The present authors adapted material from these papers to present information in a common format. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Describes the implications of the consultation process when working with an educationally and linguistically heterogeneous Spanish-speaking immigrant Latino community. Using qualitative research methodologies, the researchers studied 2 "Latino" elementary schools in 1 district. Three themes emerged: (1) role of primary language in education, (2) role of parents in the school, and (3) prevalent attitudes regarding the nature of disability. Parent participants differed in ways that impacted the role of the consultant and subsequent consultation interactions. Formal educational experiences in the parents' native country and language influenced parent participation in the educational process. Suggestions for consultants include recognizing the heterogeneity within bicultural communities and conducting thorough family interviews in an informal setting and before formal meetings to determine the concerns and goals of family members.

The remainder of this chapter is organizes according to a framework of culturally responsive mental health services for Latinos conceptualized at Fordham University's Hispanic Research Center (L. H. Rogler et al, 1987). This framework describes mental health services for Latinos as consisting of 3 levels. The 1st level refers to increasing the utilization of mental health services on the part of Latinos by decreasing obstacles to treatment. The 2nd level refers selecting treatment approaches that are compatible with Latino culture and experience. The final level refers to modifying mainstream treatment approaches in ways that are compatible with Latino culture or in ways that sensitively deviate from Latino culture in the interest of the clients well-being. This final level involves incorporating elements of Latino culture into mainstream treatment approaches and/or expanding the adaptive capacities of Latino clients adjusting to their ethnic minority, bicultural experience in the US. These levels as used to frame the remainder of the chapter. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Situational context of education: A window into the world of bilingual learners by María Estela Brisk, Angela Burgos, and Sara Ruth Hamerla (see record [rid]2004-00124-000[/rid]). The authors offer educators of language-minority students assistance in addressing two perennial challenges: linking sociolinguistic theory and research to classroom practice and strengthening connections between home and school. Their offering comes as a collection of thoughtfully crafted, tested, and honed lesson plans through which teachers and students together study the linguistic, cultural, economic, political, and social factors that affect students and their learning in a bilingual and bicultural environment. They propose that close examination of the situational context of education in one's own community will benefit students, their families, and their teachers and, ultimately, promote learning. Although touching upon a daunting array of complex topics, the authors have kept a tight focus on application, refraining from extensive exposition of theory and research and keeping the book to a manageable length and appropriate depth.

Abstract = {Investigates marketers' processes of multicultural learning and adaptation using ethnographic methods in an 8-yr longitudinal study of an ethnic marketplace in the United States. Marketer acculturation is defined as the general processes of movement and adaptation by marketers of one cultural market system to consumers of another cultural market system. The authors derive an empirical model of individual marketer acculturation that consists of learning and translation processes, adaptation strategies, and their outcomes. 15 marketers (aged 21–66 yrs) and 16 Mexican immigrant consumers in a Mexican community in a retail area of Southern California were interviewed. Findings indicate that marketers serve as bicultural mediators, both accommodating their consumers and working to alter their consumption patterns to bring them into line with their own ethnic and larger U.S. national market customs. Marketers' adaptation to the cultural characteristics and needs of their clientele results in changes to themselves, their firms, consumers, and, ultimately, the marketplace. The authors contribute to a theoretical understanding of the complex dialectical relationships between marketers and consumers, which together constitute culture in the contemporary marketplace.

Abstract = {Presents a pilot study on cancer knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes among Cambodian and Vietnamese women living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 38 21–60 yr old Southeast Asian women of Cambodian or Vietnamese origin completed telephone interviews conducted by bilingual/bicultural interviewers. Seventy-one percent of Ss did not know what cancer was and 74% were unable to identify a cancer prevention strategy. Greater knowledge about cancer and identification of preventive measures were associated with employment outside the home, more years of education, and age, but not with length of time in the US. It is concluded that cancer education programs need to identify the patient's level of knowledge about cancer, elicit and respectfully address beliefs about causality and prevention, and ensure that health information is provided in a language understandable to the patient.

Resistance in the classroom interferes with reciprocal communication and development of trust between instructors and students of color.

Abstract = {A 3 yr research project aimed at identifying patterns and favorable conditions of synergetic cooperation in international teams was conducted. The concept of "synergetic cooperation" was loosely defined as mutual compensation and enhancement of cultural characteristics and working "styles" leading to high quality performance as well as high work satisfaction of team members. An exploratory survey of experts' experiences with pluricultural teams yielded 4 distinctive categories of cooperation (dominance, coaction, integration, and innovation) which differ with regard to underlying strategies of intercultural action regulation. Acknowledging the scarcity of "truly" synergetic forms of intercultural cooperation, a process model is proposed which delineates 4 stages of team development with varying degrees of cultural diversification and interaction contingency. The model suggests essential conditions of transition from one stage to the next and points out potentials and pitfalls of team cooperation on each stage. Qualitative observations and results of quantitative interaction analyses of German/US-American problem solving groups are presented, which point to favorable conditions for bicultural team cooperation.

Abstract = {Examined whether cultural differences in family values existed among Mexican, Mexican American, and Anglo American families and whether the parents' family values were related to the family values and mental health of their adolescent children. Two-parent middle-class families, with adolescents (aged 12–14 yrs) consisting of 45 Mexicans, 39 Mexican Americans and 43 Anglo Americans, were assessed regarding traditional and modern family values, and the frequency of mental health symptoms. Significant cultural differences in family values were found among the adolescents, with Mexican adolescents the most traditional, Mexican American adolescents the most bicultural, and Anglo American adolescents the most modern. Among the parents, Anglo Americans reported greater modern family-value orientation than Mexican Americans and Mexicans. Mexican American families whose mothers hold more modern family values tended to have children who reported experiencing a higher frequency of mental health symptoms. Findings indicate that assimilation is not entirely conducive to the psychological well-being of Mexican Americans. Results also indicate the usefulness of a cultural values theoretical framework in understanding the components of culture thought to influence behavior.

Black women are at the intersection of two of the most pervasive prejudices in America, racism and sexism. In the organizational mentoring literature, there is a conspicuous absence of research on Black women. The purpose of this chapter is to combat that invisibility in the study of one domain of Black women's lives at work. This chapter presents a study which is a qualitative analysis of the mentoring experiences of Black professional women in the corporate setting. The author conducted this study with K. E. Kram's (1983) definition of mentoring in mind (i.e., a developmental relationship in which a senior person provides both psychosocial and instrumental support to a junior person). Interview data were collected from 11 Black professional women (aged 37–52 yrs). A number of themes emerged. Two prominent themes were that there is a general lack of Black role models who might serve as mentors for the women involved in the study, and that Black women's relationships with White women mentors are largely characterized by mistrust. Implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

This article emphasizes the renewing power of the feminine—a creative, healing balance that arises as traditional and contemporary strengths are brought together. Tribal diversity and predominantly egalitarian structural similarities are affirmed in this work through reviews of ethnographic studies addressing the roles of Native American women (NAWs) prior to European contact. The conventional and alternative roles of NAWs in traditional times are examined with an eye toward the spiritual source of the NAWs' strength. Studies outlining the emotional and spiritual costs of contemporary NAWs living bicultural lifestyles, especially those pursuing advanced educational training, highlight the continued use of traditional coping mechanisms. Finally, the current movement toward retraditionalization of roles of NAWs as caretakers and transmitters of cultural knowledge is posited as an effective means of overcoming problems and achieving Native American self-determination.

Abstract = {This case study gives the patient history of a 46 yr old Moroccan woman who had migrated to Eastern Canada and was being treated for depression. Ethnopsychoanalytic therapy was started at the same time as pharmacotherapy. Ethnopsychoanalytic therapy uses a multicultural group of therapists who have been trained in Western universities but who are familiar with the logic of culturally traditional therapeutic interventions. This paper describes the patient's cultural identity, the cultural explanation of her illness, perceived causes and explanatory models, and help-seeking experiences and plans. It is felt that the availability of a culturally sensitive approach to treatment enabled clinicians to establish an accurate diagnosis, that of major depressive disorder. Pharmacotherapy helped reduce the patient's symptoms. Ethnopsychoanalytic therapy also was useful in the evaluation and treatment; it was coherent with the client's bicultural identity and helped her understand her difficulties in past and present relationships.

Abstract = {The Deaf Identity Development Scale (N. Glickman, 1993) was modified to include hearing individuals and examine how hearing and deaf adults identify themselves. Statistical analysis based on 244 deaf, hard-of-hearing, and hearing adult respondents revealed a significant interaction between hearing status of self and parents on the hearing, marginal, and immersion scales of the modified version but not on the bicultural scale. Codas are more marginalized, less immersed, and similarly "hearing" in comparison to deaf persons with deaf parents. Hard-of-hearing respondents with deaf parents endorse more hearing values and fewer deaf values in comparison to deaf counterparts and also appear to be more marginalized. There were no significant differences between deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals with hearing parents. Compared to hearing respondents with hearing parents, deaf counterparts were more marginalized, more "hearing," and equally "deaf." Strong professional affiliation with the deaf community resulted in scores that differed significantly from those for individuals not as strongly affiliated. The authors discuss implications for identity development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Summarizes the adaptation and validation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Quality-of-Life Instrument for use with Spanish-speaking adult cancer patients, including those with low literacy. The Spanish language version of the FACT-General plus 5 disease-specific subscales (breast, lung, colorectal, head and neck, HIV infection) were translated, reviewed, and revised, then evaluated in interviews with 92 Spanish-speaking patients (aged 23–80 yrs). An iterative forward–backward–forward sequence of item translation, expert bilingual/bicultural advisor review, pretesting interviews, and further expert advisory input were used to establish semantic, content, and partial technical equivalence. All but one of the 28 FACT-General items and all of the disease-specific items were seen as culturally relevant. It is concluded that the FACT-General and 5 disease-specific subscales have been translated successfully into Spanish. The methods and data provide a model for preparing a health status questionnaire for cross-cultural validation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This article describes the process of negotiating my position as an Italian woman whose autobiographical project is participating in American cultural discourse. I trace a genealogy of women whose spiritual and geographical trajectories have preceded and enabled mine. With their rejection of univocal identities, Virginia Woolf, Gloria Anzaldúa, and Rosi Braidotti provide guidance in the process of negotiating a position between culture of origin and culture of immigration, between conventional and transgressive sexual identities. I propose a new model of sexual nomad and polyglot based on the categories of the transcultural and the bisexual. The first points to the positive growth made possible by the process of transitioning between cultures; the second to the move beyond self-contained, unchanging sexual identities enabled by a bicultural consciousness. The article explains how this hybridization process opened up spaces for a reconsideration of my sexual orientation and for a new sense of what constitutes education, parenting, and family.

Abstract = {Although not often a focus of psychological literature and clinical training, language is profoundly relevant to psychological treatment, particularly since what we do as clinicians is often described as the "talking cure." The extent to which the clinician understands the verbalizations that the individual reveals furthers understanding about how the individual perceives his or her world. The relationship between language and culture is inextricable and jointly bound to psychotherapeutic processes. Analysis of the role of language among patients who communicate in 2 languages and present a bicultural experience introduces psychodynamics associated with the transference-countertransference phenomenon. A case presentation supports the view that the transferential phenomenon is associated with language switching for the bilingual patient, and serves an object relational function. The case material also includes countertransferential processes not previously discussed in the literature and considers how they relate to the clinician's language-related experience.

Abstract = {Sought to assess individual differences in allocentrism-idiocentrism by developing a context-bound measure of allocentrism-idiocentrism, the Family Allocentrism Scale (FAS). Study 1 describes the assessment of an initial item pool of statements. Selection of good items was based on several criteria met by both an "Eastern" cultural group and a "Western" cultural group, thereby providing cross-cultural comparability at the item selection stage of test development. Scores on the FAS were positively related to a measure of norm-oriented identity style in both "Western" and "Eastern" samples (Study 2). With a "Western" sample (Study 3), individuals with higher levels of family allocentrism exhibited a greater sense of relatedness to their ethnic origins. In Study 4, with a group of Vietnamese immigrant university students, family connectedness moderated the relation between daily hassles and depression. In Study 5, with Russian immigrants, the relation between family allocentrism and depression depended on the level of bicultural competence. Results provide support for the construct validity of the FAS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Cultural, linguistic, and economic barriers place many Asian Americans in jeopardy of missing opportunities for disease prevention, early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and participation in clinical trials. To address these barriers, a community-based health education demonstration program focusing on cancer prevention was developed. This article reviews this prevention program and evaluates its efficacy for this ethnic group. Several techniques were found to be useful in initiating health promotion conversations: staffing was done with a variety of bicultural and bilingual undergraduates trained to work as community health educators; Asian grocery stores were selected as optimal educational sites; and adaptation of sheltered English teaching techniques and hands-on teaching aids helped to overcome language barriers. The educational intervention was evaluated using unobtrusive measures. Reaching this population with the help of ethnically and linguistically compatible students was effective, but the barriers they faced when trying to connect with their potential audience were still considerable. It is concluded that further evaluation of the strategies used in this intervention is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results showed an intergroup differentiation in communication patterns in terms of the use of multiple network types with the in- and out-group members.

The themes of reciprocity and point of reckoning emerged as 2 descriptive characteristics of the Mexican American family in the southwestern United States that form the basis for the restructuring of a woman's responsibilities during middle age.

Abstract = {In this chapter, Ho underlines that Yu Shun has been the model man to more people than any other since the dawn of civilization, although many people today have never heard of him. Ho contrasts Yu Shun's selfless attitude toward his parents in the face of their cruel treatment of him with Western stories such as Oedipus Rex in which the "hero" kills his father. Whereas father–son relationships in Chinese culture are expected to result in the "psychological capitulation" of the son, the Western hero tries to free himself from the emotional fetters imposed upon him by his parents, and then strikes out on his own. But Ho, whose bicultural background sensitizes him to both the power of Confucian moralism and the liberating messages of Western psychology, is not an admirer of the psychological legacy of the Legend of Yu Shun and of the countless other Chinese stories containing similar messages. To Ho, the self-sacrificial attitude modeled by Yu Shun frequently leads to self-destructive behavior, authoritarian moralism, and the strict control of one's "improper" impulses and thoughts. For the Chinese family therapist, this means that genuine harmonization of family relationships requires recognizing and working through ambivalent feelings toward one's family members.

Abstract = {Presents an ethnography of Havens, a town on the US–Mexico border, and describes the author's personal observations from the perspective of both a teacher and a community member. The book begins with a description of Havens and its inevitable interdependence with its Mexican neighbors. Next, three "cultural mediators" are introduced, two students and one teacher from Havens High School. These individuals are highly conscious of their border-bound lives and work actively to medicate between their local and Mexican cultures. The author then describes the language landscape in the community and the schools, focusing on the relation between the use of Spanish and English. This is followed by a specific description of bilingual education programs in the district. The author discusses the social structure in the high school and described the students' interactions across cultural lines. The author concludes by presenting an alternative metaphor for thinking about the border and by identifying markers of opportunity that already exist in Havens as it works toward defining what it means to be a bicultural and binational community.

Abstract = {Presents a literature survey on the identity of Asian young people in Britain. One of the main findings to emerge concerns the saliency of ethnicity. Ethnicity seems to be rooted in religion and language, which in many instances is only symbolic in nature, i.e., the young people are not always practicing their religion, nor are they learning to read and write their ancestral language. Ethnicity is instead largely attributed to 2 factors: in-group belongingness and the experience of racism. It emerges that ethnic identity develops as does the ego-identity, and that E. J. Marcia's model, as adapted by S. J. Phinney (1996), is conceptually sound and a pragmatic procedure to understand ethnicity. It appears that a majority of the young people are learning to be bicultural and bilingual (at a spoken level) and are developing 'hyphenated' identities. At the one end of the 'assimilation–separation' continuum, are the Hindu-origin young people, who are likely to seek assimilation to the British way of life, while at the other end are the Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who are prone to emphasize their distinctive Muslim identity and to seek merely a form of accommodation with their host culture. Young people of Indian background are pursuing a 'middle way' of integration between the 2 cultures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the influence of Hispanic-American ethnicity on the family-related and nature-related benefits of outdoor recreation activity. Ethnic assimilation theory is used as a conceptual framework to examine patterns of Anglo-conformity in perceived recreation benefits, and to look for deviations in these patterns suggestive of selective acculturation. Data were collected through a telephone survey of 995 households in central and southern California. Hispanic respondents were classified as "least-acculturated," "bicultural," or "most-acculturated" based on their comprehension and use of Spanish vs English. These 3 groups were compared to Anglo-Americans who had very low comprehension of Spanish. A strong Anglo-conformity pattern was found in the perceived importance of nature-related benefits from outdoor recreation participation. The more assimilated the Hispanic respondents, the more similar they were to Anglos in the importance of these benefits. This indicated that varying levels of assimilation are an important source of diversity within ethnic groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {185 Asian American undergraduates participated in a study designed to examine the relationships among gender, acculturation, achievement orientation, and fear of academic success. Acculturation was modestly correlated with achievement orientation. Endorsement of Asian and Anglo values was significantly related to individual-oriented achievement. Marginal significance, however, was obtained for endorsement of Asian values and beliefs to social-oriented achievement. These findings suggest that persons with a bicultural identity tend to adopt a multifaceted achievement style. Achievement orientation, in turn, predicted fear of academic success, with gender and perceived discrepancies from parental achievement values contributing minimal additional variance. Social-oriented achievement was related to high fear of academic success, whereas an individualistic orientation buffered against such conflicts.

Abstract = {Investigated relationships among biculturalism, differentness, loneliness, and alienation in 138 Hispanic American undergraduate students (mean age 22 yrs). A diathesis-stress hypothesis predicted biculturalism would buffer feelings of loneliness and alienation resulting from feelings of differentness in a bicultural context. Ss voluntarily completed 4 questionnaires in their classrooms. Analysis revealed an inverse relationship between biculturalism and the degree of loneliness and alienation reported. A direct relationship was apparent between perceived differences in value orientations from those of family members and the degree of loneliness and alienation reported. The diathesis-stress model was not supported. A lower level of biculturalism was the best predictor of loneliness, whereas perceived differences in value orientations between students and their family was the most important predictor of alienation. Findings indicate that the relationships between these factors support a sense of belonging and have a direct effect on the well-being of Hispanic college students rather than merely a stress-buffering effect.

The data were gathered through semi-structured interviews from 200 Punjabi mothers in 1970, and 40 mothers in 1995. Results show that while the 2nd-generation Punjabis in the study are changing some of their traditional mores (equal treatment of boys and girls, modified system of arranged marriages), they are also eager to transmit the core values (religion, mother tongue and familial spirit) of their culture. Most mothers want their children to appreciate the cultural diversity of British society and to develop a bicultural outlook. The implications for teachers and policy-makers are explored.

Abstract = {Shame and guilt narratives of 22 1st- and 2nd-generation Asian Americans and 9 multigeneration European Americans were collected in semistructured interviews to learn how respondents perceive the phenomenology, function, and interpersonal dynamics of these emotions. This article focuses on the formal characteristics of shame episodes reported by members of these groups and offers an interpretive explanation for differences that involve respondents' conceptions of the self and related cultural practices. The analysis proposes that shame is at times embedded in a triadic structure for 1st-generation Asian Americans comprised of the actor, a shamed other, and an audience. European American shame experiences, however, typically conform to a dyadic structure of actor and audience. Shame stories of 2nd-generation Asian Americans contain elements of both emotion ecologies that may reflect a unique, bicultural adaptation. These findings are consistent with a cultural constructionist view of the emotions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Symptoms of depression were compared for various acculturation levels, and bicultural groups with controls for SES and gender. The Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II (ARSMA-II) was used to assess acculturation characteristics. Clinical depression and symptoms of depression were measured using the DSD26 Symptom Scale for assessment of depressive symptoms and major depression. Variance in depression scores was found to be influenced more by gender and SES than by acculturation or ethnic identity status. Assimilated Mexican Americans reported significantly fewer symptoms of depression than their more traditional counterparts. Ethnicity and acculturation per se were not found to lessen or increase risk for depression, but SES associated with ethnicity was found to directly affect depression scores.

In establishing integrated identities, gay men face psychosocial challenges that differ from those of most heterosexuals, although heterosexual males of minority cultures may confront similar developmental tasks.

Current stress, which measured the degree of stress created by acculturative tasks such as learning a new language, seeking employment, rebuilding social supports, and redefining roles, was the strongest overall predictor of mental health. Social workers should design and implement programs that will decrease current stressors and rebuild indigenous social supports to enhance acculturation and reduce mental health problems.

Results found few inmates in the marginal group and no relationship between acculturative status and acculturative stress. Native inmates had significantly higher levels of acculturative stress than non-Native inmates, and other measures of stress did not discriminate between these two groups. Only non-Native inmates had higher levels of interpersonal violence related to acculturative stress, but their experience of acculturative stress was compounded by perceived, chronic, and situational stress. Apparently, non-Native inmates' feelings of acculturative stress are actually a sense of being discriminated against unrelated to their ethnicity.

Abstract = {In this chapter, the authors draw upon their experience at the Hispanic Treatment Program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders among Hispanic Americans. The authors review a variety of important issues such as the growing Hispanic population in the US, the limited number of bilingual-bicultural mental health specialists, and patients' level of acculturation. They also address how these issues impact the patient's view of mental illness and of seeking help for anxiety symptoms. The culture-bound syndromes of ataque de nervios and nervios are reviewed. The authors briefly discuss their experiences using medications for anxiety disorders within this population, and provide an overview of their use of a culturally sensitive interview that they believe helps engage this traditionally treatment-resistant population.

Abstract = {In this article emotional problems - operationalized in terms of well-being and feelings of stress/depression - were investigated in secondary school pupils in the Netherlands. Girls, both autochthonous and allochthonous, appear to have more emotional problems than boys. Allochthonous pupils reported more emotional problems than autochthonous pupils. The difference was most pronounced between allochthonous pupils and autochthonous pupils in ethnic autochthonous ("white") schools. Ethnic self-identification is not by itself related to feelings of well-being or stress, but appears to serve as a moderator in this respect: in ethnic minority youngsters with a bicultural orientation (identification with both their own ethnic group and the Dutch), no effect of ethnic attitudes on stress was found, while in those identifying solely with their own ethnic group, negative attitudes towards their own group or towards the Netherlands increases feelings of stress.

Abstract = {Recent psychiatric literature and contemporary sociopolitical developments suggest a need to reconsider the place of religion and spirituality in psychiatry. Material from psychiatric, sociological and religious studies literature was reviewed, with particular emphasis on New Zealand sources. Despite the secularizing effects of science, the presence and influence of "religiosity" remains substantial in Western culture. The literature emphasizes the central importance of religion and spirituality for mental health, and the difficulty of integrating these concepts with scientific medicine. Psychiatric tradition and training may exaggerate the "religiosity gap" between doctors and patients. In New Zealand, the politically mandated bicultural approach to mental health demands an understanding of Maori spirituality. Intellectual, moral and pragmatic arguments all suggest that psychiatry should reconsider its attitude to religion and spirituality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Focuses on the interaction of language, nonverbal communication, and cognitive styles for bilingual/bicultural individuals. It is argued that cross-cultural communicative competence requires more than learning the language of the other culture; social cultural competence also is necessary and this involves understanding the culture, social knowledge, and cognition of native speakers of the language. Social pragmatic differences can lead to breakdowns in communication. Acquisition of any language requires the learner to face certain challenges. These challenges that go beyond semantics, phonology, pragmatics, and translation are discussed. Stories are used to illustrate the many aspects of language, culture, cognitive style, and the complexity of operating under dual language conditions.

Abstract = {Asian Americans are proportionately the fastest growing minority in the US. Once considered a model minority, recent studies have suggested that Asians have a fairly high prevalence of alcoholism. The authors present epidemiological data from the few available surveys involving the Asian American community. An important consideration is that the term "Asian American" does not represent a homogenous group. It comprises people from many countries, several major religious groups, various socioeconomic levels, and different lengths of time and levels of acculturation in the US. The presence of aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency also represents a relevant biological difference in some subgroups. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to encompass all relevant parameters in any one study, but each of these factors clearly affects the rates and expressions of alcohol use, and they all represent important considerations for treatment. Culturally sensitive and/or bicultural programs are indicated for the proper treatment of this population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a community-based sample of Hispanic women, this study examined differences in relation to level of acculturation in knowledge about the Pap examination, fear/fatalism towards cancer, and cervical cancer screening behaviors. 566 respondents were randomly chosen from 11 churches in the Phoenix metropolitan area and were categorized into three acculturation levels: low, bicultural, and high. Interviews focused on family history of cancer as well as knowledge about cancer and utilization of screening techniques for breast and cervical cancers. Findings indicate that Ss used cervical cancer screening services with over 90% of women in all 3 acculturation groups ever having had a Pap exam and more than 50% having had the examination during the past year. However, results also indicate that of the Hispanic subgroups examined, lower acculturated Hispanic women have less knowledge about Pap smears and exhibit lower utilization rates for cervical cancer screening. These results suggest that lower-acculturated Hispanic women comprise the subgroup of Hispanics that is at greatest risk of presenting with advanced stages of cervical cancer.

All the children were born in England and belong to 3 main religious groups: Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu. Findings suggest that despite the children's initial difficulty with English and the differences between home and school cultures, they were a cheerful group who, in their unique ways, are coming to terms with their bilingualism and biculturalism within a multicultural situation. The majority of children, however, could not read or write in their mother tongue. On the whole, the children liked their school and were aiming to continue their education to enter professional occupations. The children were developing a bicultural outlook by learning to speak their mother tongue and having at least some knowledge of the teachings of their faiths. Through their current experience of racism in their school and neighborhood the children also recognized that they will have to face racism in the wider society.

Many, if not most, subjects are explored from the dual perspective of minority group members and of members of the dominant culture. The result is a spectrum with particular but not exclusive relevance for those who work with women in the area of mental health and for readers who seek to enrich their lives with psychological insights and understanding of antiracism.  Readers will find help in these pages for questions concerning racial and cultural differences. It is not merely a quick-fix book but rather a set of . . . essays that can help well-meaning individuals turn good intentions into good behaviors.  Racism in the Lives of Women . . . covers these topics and others: connections between racisim and violence against women; White women's efforts to be antiracist; difficulty and necessity of maintaining an antiracist perspective; biracial and bicultural identity formation [and] developing an antiracist norm as part of feminist ethics.

Scales-Trent uses autobiography both as a way to describe these issues and to develop a theory of the social construction of race. . . .

The dominance of Western paradigms has been identified as a significant barrier to Maori participation in psychology. The aim of this special feature issue of the New Zealand Journal of Psychology was to support Maori psychologists in their professional development by providing just such an opportunity. The intent has been to produce a collection of papers that critique and reflect on emerging Maori psychological theory, practice and research, and showcase Maori psychologists in Aotearoa. The emphasis was on Maori-focused work, including kaupapa Maori work as well as papers that focus on working with Maori in parallel development or bicultural settings. The final selection of papers, drawn from a total of 14 submissions, reflect the permanence of Western paradigms in psychology training in New Zealand. Academic undergraduate and postgraduate work provides the impetus for most of the papers and thus this issue suggests Maori students of psychology are very much still focused on learning.

These types of stressors include being mistaken for Vietnamese, verbal and physical assaults that are race-related, death and near-death experiences that are race-related, racial stigmatization, dissociation from one's Asian identity, and marginalization.

Cultural responsiveness is important in recognizing multiple aspects of the client's identity, overcoming cultural barriers to recovery or to participation in the counseling process, and addressing a source of stress that may contribute to substance abuse. Four general techniques for being culturally responsive include individualizing the counseling approach, avoiding assumptions, acting to build trust, and identifying cultural issues that affect client recovery. Specifically, counselors can respond effectively to particular cultural characteristics by accommodating the client's family values through 1-person family or bicultural counseling, and responding to different types of communication (directive vs nondirective, expressive vs detached, hiding vs disclosing, and physical reserve vs demonstrative).

As one way to actualize latent theory into practical application, the techniques of EthE involve experience-near interactions that offer opportunities for patients to feel they share in shaping the therapeutic venture. Through knowledge of relevant real-life experiences about their therapists, patients learn to feel at ease and empathize with their therapists in cementing the ethnocultural alliance. The techniques of EthE are founded on the belief that complex bicultural dynamics can be positively influenced by systematic insertion of specific exercises into the fabric of ongoing psychotherapy to bring about a better "gluing interface" between patient and therapist.

Abstract = {Within the Convoy Model, social networks are viewed as dynamic hierarchic structures surrounding the individual throughout life. As a step toward empirical definition of convoy structure and function across the life span, a bicultural sample (N = 159) of young adult women, their mothers, and their grandmothers were queried. Comparable results were obtained across generations and cultures with regard to network size, the amount of support provided by the network, and the nomination of close family members as primary sources of support. However, there was a marked shift across generations in the balance of familial vs friendship relations. Younger persons included fewer family members and more friends in their networks, and they received more support from friends. These cross-sectional results are consistent with the Convoy Model and suggest that longitudinal research is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Schooling in the contemporary world has a multiple agenda: the promotion of economic progress, the transmission of culture from generation to generation, and the cultivation of children's intellectual and moral development. This book explores the difficulties of achieving a synthesis of these objectives, in a case study of a rural African community. The analysis contrasts the indigenous perspective on child development with the formal educational model of cognitive growth. Teachers in the local primary school are shown to face the challenge of bicultural mediation, and the significance of schooling is discussed for each of the diverse individuals of the study in terms of his or her own reflections and interpretations. Two different attempts to activate a local dialogue about the school as a community resource are described, and the implications for approaches to educational planning are explored.  My analysis will be centred around a case study conducted in a rural area of Zambia over the period 1974–1975. . . . At the beginning of the project, members of the study cohort were aged between 6 and 14 yrs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (book)},

It is argued that a culturally sensitive approach to working with this special population is a professional and ethical necessity, and it is suggested that a congruence exists between the cognitive-behavioral approach to therapy and the needs and preferences of Native Americans. A therapeutic approach is presented that calls for an assessment of client acculturation/deculturation and bicultural competence, and the integration of conventional with traditional interventions aimed at biculturally appropriate treatment goals is recommended. Key therapeutic issues and problems presented by working with this population are discussed, and guidelines for dealing with them are suggested.

Abstract = {Best practices in service delivery to families of children who are disabled or at risk for disabilities have moved toward a much more family focused or family centered approach.  As professors in personnel preparation programs, directors of early intervention programs and projects, consultants, and active members of the early intervention community, we often have been asked questions regarding the provision of services to families from a range of cultural backgrounds. . . . A number of excellent handbooks have helped us learn, as has participation in specific cross-cultural experiences and training programs—but no single source combined a strong conceptual framework with the specific information that we felt we and our students needed to know. This book is designed to combine those features. It is based upon literature that describes best practices in early intervention, the literature on intercultural effectiveness, and information and insights from contributing authors who are bicultural and often bilingual.  This book is organized into three sections. Part I provides the reader with an introduction to issues surrounding working with families from diverse cultural, ethnic, and language groups.  Part II, the core of the book, introduces the reader to a number of the major cultural and ethnic groups that make up the population of the United States. Each group is described in terms of its history, values, and beliefs, with particular emphasis on issues related to the family, childrearing, and disability.  The final section of this book, Part III, synthesizes the information presented in Parts I and II and provides recommendations for interventionists working in service delivery systems.  The book is designed to be of use to the range of professionals providing educational, health care, and social services (e.g., educators, nurses, speech and language specialists, audiologists, occupational and physical therapists, physicians, social workers, psychologists) to families who have young children who are disabled or at risk for disabilities.

There is no unique spatial primitive in Navajo knowledge, and each and every notion is constituted in a different way than its Genevan correlate. The total system of Navajo knowledge shows a structure of interrelated and codetermining notions, which differs markedly from the unilinear logical-deductive structure in the Piagetian model. A position is taken against the Piaget-based rationalistic education policy found in the New Math movement. Principles of Freudenthal are explored in a non-Western setting: children should reinvent geometry on their own in the terms of their culture.

Abstract = {Explores the potential application of behavior therapy to cross-cultural situations as societies move to recognize their bicultural or multicultural composition. The moral and epistemological underpinnings of behavior therapy and questions involving the universality of behavior principles and technologies are reviewed. Expected competencies of cross-cultural therapists are also raised. The basic message, told through examples from Australia, North America, and elsewhere, is that cultural norms and values penetrate every facet of client–therapist interaction and clinical decision making. Competently performed functional analyses can produce culturally accommodating interventions that respond to culture-specific definitions of deviancy, accepted norms of role behavior, expectations of change techniques, and approved behavior change practitioners.

Findings revealed 2 major types of supportive relationships: (1) other-oriented, in which Ss' bonds with other Black women emphasized the provision of support to the other, and (2) self-enhancing, in which Ss' bonds with other Black women were reciprocal in nature or were oriented toward self. Three main functions of support were found within these relationships: (1) social companionship, (2) task help, and (3) supportiveness. The receipt of supportiveness (consisting of emotional support, high commitment to one another, and encouragement) resulted in the highest levels of growth and development among Ss, thus most effectively validating and addressing their experience of bicultural stress.

All Ss were aged 16–41 yrs. The perceived unavailability of culturally similar or sensitive counselors was a more important deterrent for ethnic-identified minority Ss than it was for bicultural or mainstream-identified minority Ss. All 3 groups prioritized the availability of counselors who value and respect cultural differences as a means of improving CSs.

The conventional and alternative roles of NAWs in traditional times are examined with an eye toward the spiritual source of the NAWs' strength. Studies outlining the emotional and spiritual costs of contemporary NAWs living bicultural lifestyles, especially those pursuing advanced educational training, highlight the continued use of traditional coping mechanisms. Finally, the current movement toward retraditionalization of roles of NAWs as caretakers and transmitters of cultural knowledge is posited as an effective means of overcoming problems and achieving Native American self-determination.

The editors have done their job well in selecting, monitoring, and coordinating subsequent chapters, so that one gets this big picture throughout the book with reasonably good continuity. The broad coverage includes chapters on the complexities of clientage, the organization and delivery of school psychological services to rural schools, school psychology in bicultural settings, the impact of educational psychological research on school psychology, training issues, and attempts to reconceptualize service models. There tends to be some redundancy, but this is not necessarily a problem. A number of the authors spend time describing the traditional and more narrow models out of which school psychology has historically been practiced; they then present an expanded view of alternate ways of viewing the professional field and conceptualizing the delivery of services.

In their recent review article, Bhugra & Mastrogianni describe the cultural and mental health aspects of what is now called globalisation, and its present and future impact upon mental disorders, with a special reference to depression. Among the many unknowns in that matter, the authors point towards the issue of whether cultures will homogenise, which seems improbable, or whether the tendency for communities to reassert their distinctive ethnic identities will prevail. However, new concepts of biculturalism and bicultural identity are emerging that are relevant to globalisation. Traditional definitions imply migration processes, either voluntary or forced, as in the case of refugees. This new form of biculturalism could be both an opportunity for personal fulfilment and a source of identity confusion. Factors influencing these possible' outcomes one way or the other should be integrated in cultural psychiatry research agendas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {National Finns (N = 286), as well as potential, Ingrian Finnish (N = 229) and Russian (N = 78) migrants from Russia to Finland rated their own personal values and the values of a typical Finn and Russian. Virtually all participants in our migrant samples, although still living in Russia, had been in frequent contact with Finns and Finland, suggesting that they could be considered expert judges regarding the values of Russians and Finns. Indeed, both samples were highly accurate in their descriptions of the typical Finn. However, Ingrian Finns’ ratings of the typical Russian were, perhaps due to past conflict-ridden intergroup relations, distorted by contrast effects. Specifically, the typical Russian was portrayed as opposite to how Ingrian Finns saw themselves and also to how they saw the typical Finn. Surprisingly, the Russian migrants, although they did not show any contrast effects, were also inaccurate in their ratings of the typical Russian. The sample of national Finns generally showed no accuracy in their ratings of the typical Finns or Russian, but did show a contrast effect between self-ratings and the ratings of a typical Russian. Contrary to previous research that has found even expert ratings of national stereotypes to be inaccurate, the current results suggest that bi-cultural individuals (the Ingrian Finns) and other experts (the Russian spouses of the Ingrian Finns) can provide accurate national stereotypes. However, individuals embedded within the one culture only may lack a reference point for rating their compatriots. One key difference to previous research is the use of personal values rather than personality traits to measure the accuracy of national stereotypes.

Abstract = {20 Cambodian refugees (aged 30–50 yrs) with premigration histories of trauma received an average of 16 sessions of individual therapy from a Cambodian bicultural counselor at a trauma treatment center in Sydney, Australia. 19 of the 20 patients reported that during treatment they had been willing to talk about their trauma histories, a finding that raises doubts about the commonly held belief that Asians are not psychologically minded and avoid disclosing emotionally sensitive information to health care workers. However, self-disclosing therapy alone did not appear to benefit these patients. Only 4 patients found talking about their trauma story directly helpful in improving their emotional state, and 3 of the 4 found the relief to be transitory.

Readers of the critical history are also directeced to the work of J. Berry (2003) in acculturation psychology. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2003-01663-002[/rid].) The psychology of intercultural adaptation was first discussed by Plato. Many modern enculturation theories claim that ethnic minorities (including aboriginal natives, immigrants, refugees, and sojourners) can favor either the dominant culture, or their own minority culture, or both, or neither. Between 1918 and 1984, 68 such theories showed varied and inconsistent terminology, poor citation of earlier research, conflicting and poorly tested predictions of acculturative stress, and lack of logic, for example, 2 cultures in contact logically allow 16 types of acculturation, not just 4. Logic explains why assimilation = negative chauvinism = marginality, why measures of incompatible acculturative attitudes can be positively correlated, and why bicultural integration and marginalisation are confounded constructs. There is no robust evidence that biculturalism is most adaptive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Whether such programs as bilingual-bicultural education and black studies can use the so-called "disadvantages" of ethnic minority pupils for their scholastic self-realization merits the attention of schoolmen and scholars alike.

Abstract = {Reviewed the 3 basic points of reference in foreign language instruction: (a) historical antecedents of learning language abroad, (b) the scientific reasons for "cultural-linguistic immersion," (c) "natural setting" language learning guidelines. History has advanced the theory that the best possible way to learn a foreign language is through a combining of experiences and formal training. Psycholinguistics has proposed that language is a system of experience based on verbal symbols, and that it is a complex sociopsychological process. It is suggested that the student experience "systematic interaction" with the foreign environment aided by a working, selective syllabus. The student should be made aware of contrasting and comparing linguistic and cultural patterns. Well planned "life exercises" would be experiences through proper use of textbooks and audiolingual processes. It is concluded that the most vital tool in foreign language learning is the teacher and advises that he be ideally both bilingual and bicultural.

The measures were chosen to test 2 theoretical positions about the effects of interethnic marriages: (a) that cultural mixture is harmful because of divided loyalties and unclear identifications, or (b) that a bicultural background is broadening and enriching. It was found that the mixed ethnic boys showed no signs of personality disturbance, anomie, or feelings of alienation relative to the comparison groups, and perceived their parents as relatively more attentive and interested in them as family members. They were no less ethnocentric or authoritarian, although their attitudes suggest a process of cultural fusion rather than a clear-cut preference for 1 or the other system of values. Results were clearer for the mixed ethnic boys attending French rather than English schools, revealing the importance of the peer group influence in the adjustments made. (French summary) (26 ref.)

The language conflict involved more than bilingualism. The desire to succeed in school or work required mastery of Dutch, while emotional ties to the family encouraged the use of Spanish. Conflicts were also apparent with respect to religion and to cultural ideas about the importance of work, family, and recreation. Younger persons, particularly those born in Holland, did not necessarily feel the same ties to Spain as did their parents and desired to be integrated into Dutch social and political life. Assimilation was a divisive factor, and there was some discrimination among Dutch employers toward immigrants that hindered the development of a transcultural or bicultural feeling.

Ss were randomly assigned to a bicultural Spanish-speaking unit or to 1 of 4 control units. Results reveal that 2 yrs after discharge, 45 Ss had been readmitted to a psychiatric facility, primarily for noncompliance with aftercare. This readmission rate corresponded to that of other US ethnic groups. NPs were generally unemployed, living with their families, and attending clinic appointments regularly. A discriminant analysis indicated that psychopathology, social adjustment, and acculturation, determined by an in-hospital test battery that included the Psychotic Inpatient Profile, were related to readmission. Measures of paranoia, acculturation, number of previous admissions, length of hospital stay (during the research period), and hostility were higher for RPs. NPs scored higher on measures of depression, disorientation, and total length of stay for prior admissions. (31 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Pretesting on an acculturation scale placed 94 Hispanic undergraduate college students in one of three types, Hispanic acculturated, bicultural, or Anglo acculturated. The participants viewed a counseling videotape of one of two White female counselors portraying either a directive or a nondirective counseling style and rated her on two scales.

Abstract = {Developed a prevention program targeting Hispanic women designated at high risk for abusive and neglectful behavior toward their children and identified problems faced by 41 program participants (aged 17–55 yrs). Findings suggest the need for an ethnically sensitive parenting education program in the Hispanic community as a preventive measure against child abuse and neglect. It is suggested that the increased vulnerability of low-income Hispanic women calls for a comprehensive program that includes the following: bicultural/bilingual staff, a culturally relevant parenting curriculum, in-home and group parenting lessons, individual and family counseling sessions, formal education courses, job training and employment opportunities, and other supportive services (e.g., transportation).

Cultural factors involving communication styles, respect for authority, and traditional social relationships were found to influence the group process. Socialization experiences that encouraged traditional activities and practical information were the most acceptable medium by all groups. Psychological issues of losses, cultural conflicts, and persistent discussion of somatic symptoms were voiced throughout the activities. Formal group psychotherapy was periodically useful in some groups. Flexibility, meeting concrete needs, keeping a bicultural focus, and maintaining the individual therapy sessions contributed to patient acceptance.

Abstract = {As an alternative to the traditional acculturistic model of education, a pluralistic model is presented designed to meet the needs of children from the low-income, urban Black ethclass. Compensatory education exemplifies the failure of the acculturistic model. Cultural deprivation continues to exist since it is not reasonable to believe the Black ethclass will become White and middle class because their teachers want or expect this to occur. Another problem is folklore about how Black children learn, e.g., (a) relationships between research methodology and outcomes of schooling, based on inappropriate research models; (b) speculation on relationships between teacher expectations and outcomes of schooling; (c) presumed relationships between learning and achievement motivation; and (d) preference of "radio-announcer" language (i.e., standard English) over Ebonics. G. West and J. White asked Black children and youth what kinds of experiences would enable effective coping. These themes emerged: an area of perceived mastery that would generate self-confidence; positive recognition of and reinforcement for perceived areas of mastery by peer group; and the opportunity to choose among alternatives for action in one's best interest. A set of moves for attaining these educational goals are recommended, including bicultural examination of interaction between Black children and schooling agents; more Black role models in education; data reflective of the Black frame of reference; evidence of the value Black children bring to schooling; and reorganization of delivery systems developing mastery, self-confidence, self-recognition, and belongingness.

Abstract = {Argues that the nature of the concept of multicultural education needs to be defined more specifically. Cultural value systems may be mutually exclusive at certain points, and a school must make value priorities in deciding how it is going to operate. Once value priorities are made, the values of a majority or minority population within the school may be discriminated against. If minority people in the US are to succeed in economic terms they must be able to function in a society based on White middle-class skills and values. Multicultural education, then, must include provisions for minority peoples to learn to operate in the world of the majority. Multicultural education can thus take 2 alternative forms. It can involve a system of real equal educational opportunity for minority students in schools run according to the principles of the White middle-class majority or it can involve the creation of bilingual, bicultural schools in which all students learn to operate in 2 differing cultural contexts. Multicultural education cannot ignore the value system of mainstream America, or it will result in the maintenance of separate and economically unequal communities.

Abstract = {Epidemiological studies indicate that Hispanics underutilize community mental health facilities in proportion to their needs and often fail to benefit from traditional psychotherapeutic services. The present study investigated the effectiveness of a modeling therapy designed to be sensitive to Hispanic culture. In one version of the modality, cuentos (folktales) from Puerto Rican culture were used to present models of adaptive behavior and in another version folktales were tailored to bridge Puerto Ricans' bicultural conflict. 210 high-risk children from kindergarten through the 3rd grade and their mothers were randomly assigned to receive either cuento therapy, traditional art/play therapy, or no therapy.

Abstract = {Points out that the past 2 decades of early childhood (ECH) intervention programs have demonstrated the potentially strong linkages between research, public policies, and program implementation. However, the conceptual models and theoretical frames of reference that have historically guided American behavioral and social scientists have generally lacked significant formative input from those who are the objects of investigation. For the government role in ECH education to make a significant break from the cultural myopia of its past, there must be a clear recognition of the severe limitations of the current approach. As long as African-American scholars, researchers, and program developers are considered a radical fringe whose only purpose is to reflect a minority perspective, the fundamental nature of ECH education programs will not drastically change. A meaningful emphasis on the promotion of biculturalism can only come about when African-American professionals assume the responsibility for developing conceptual models, conducting research to determine the appropriateness of the models, and initiating programs based in valid and empirical results. The outcome will likely be the widespread development of programs that play major roles on the development of self-confident, independent, and bicultural African-American children.

The Institute trained Hispanic parents to become more involved in their children's bilingual education by training them to become effective members and leaders of the City-Wide Bilingual Bicultural Advisory Committee. 34 parents (mean age 35 yrs) participated in the program the 1st yr. The impact of the program was increasingly felt, with each local school housing a bilingual program holding at least one community meeting. Four participants presented testimony before the Wisconsin Advisory Committee to the US Commission on Civil Rights as part of an assessment of bilingual education in the State of Wisconsin.

The TCLA was administered to 7 7–8 yr olds who had immigrated to Britain. Ss also completed an index of language processes and Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices. Both the Raven's test and the TCLA were largely independent of Ss' cultural reorientation. On the TCLA, only the Visual-Perceptual Learning subscale met the criteria of being culturally independent and able to assess S's progress in the English language.

Part One opens with an overview of the concerns and issues facing the practitioner. There follows a discussion of the main theories of psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic aspects of bilingualism and the practical implications are made clear. New research in Panjabi and Bengali mother-tongue and second-language English is presented in subsequent chapters. Detailed suggestions are given in one chapter about setting up similar research studies which will be useful for practitioners and managers.  Part Two concerns clinical management of bilingual pre-school, mainstream and special needs children, with a chapter devoted to each. Models for intervention are described for clinical experience. Working in a multidisciplinary and multilingual team is a common theme which is well-illustrated by case studies. A further chapter discusses assessment issues and procedures. The need to access, recruit and train bilingual/bicultural personnel, and the issues and practices this involves, are sensitively and positively discussed in a separate chapter.  This book is written by teachers and speech therapists who work with bilingually language impaired children. It is highly readable, positive and placed within a sound theoretical framework. Above all, it promotes good practice and fruitful clinical experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (cover)},

Abstract = {Research on Hispanic childrearing practices reveals that compared to Anglo-American and Black families, Hispanic families are characterized by (1) a greater emphasis on support from within the family system and less emphasis on self-reliance, (2) a more authoritarian parenting style, and (3) closer maternal relationships and more open expression of parental affection. These differences are moderated in part by SES and degree of acculturation. School psychologists need to stress the positive values of being bicultural to increase the Hispanic child's self-esteem, which often suffers from the differential treatment by teachers and the internalization of negative stereotypes. School psychologists and teachers should develop strategies to encourage independent school-work behavior and the development of self-reliance. The interdependence characteristic of Hispanic families must be taken into account during intervention, which may require the active involvement of the entire family.

Abstract = {Over the past 10 yrs or so, as awareness of the value of a bicultural ideal for Canadian society has increased, there has been a lively interest in bilingual approaches to education. Many English-speaking Canadian parents have come to expect, even demand, school programs that "immerse" their 5- or 6-yr-olds in a 2nd language (French). The author explores the phenomenon of early 2nd-language immersion in terms of the development of young children who are becoming aware of themselves and the world as they learn to speak, read, and write both the mother tongue and the 2nd language. A review of the literature on early immersion suggests that one should not be overly enthusiastic about the method's value. Major social changes depend on many complicated factors, and for all its importance, language should not be emphasized as the only approach to biculturalism.

Japanese-Americans were selected for study because of their generational, ethnic, and social structures. The authors hypothesized that a change in sex guilt would occur across the generations of Japanese-Americans, approximating a bicultural adaptation. Ss completed the Mosher Forced-Choice Guilt Inventory. Results support the hypothesis and indicate that although the Japanese-American Ss were highly acculturated, significant cross-cultural differences emerged, especially among Japanese-American women. These women exhibited the most sex guilt. Furthermore, where gender differences did occur, they favored greater flexibility for men, in general, and for Japanese-American men in comparison to Japanese-American women.

Abstract = {Attempted to test, in a bicultural, controlled comparison, 2 sociological theories of mental disorders. Theory 1 proposes that the stereotypes of mental illness profoundly shape the symptoms of mental illness in America; Theory 2 maintains that the requirements and needs of the mental hospital largely determine the "symptoms" of the chronic mental patient. Matched samples of 112 mental patients in Germany and 110 in America were subjected to in-depth interviews and administered semantic differentials. Ss were divided into groups according to length of confinement. Results reveal statistically significant differences between the 2 nationalities. German Ss generally agreed that mental illness is a biologically determined and incurable condition. In contrast, American Ss generally believed that the individual is partially responsible for his condition and with the proper motivation and help, he can improve. Ss' statements on the 5 semantic differentials about themselves and about proper behavior in the hospital were consistent with these national differences. It is concluded that institutionalization consists more in conditioning the patient to accept his status than in convincing him that he is insane.

This allows for a more coherent analysis of the interactions of 3 cultural phenomena: formal schooling, femininity, and masculinity. Genetic differences, cultural differences and biculturalism are 3 models of cultural interaction which contribute to understanding the systematic relationship between sex-role culture and educational practice. From an educational perspective, sex-linked genetic differences are real but unstable and situational. By contrast, bicultural blendings are beneficial and increasingly prevalent. The task of the school is to provide equal access to traditionally sex-typed educational and cultural resources. Biculturalism occurs through the "hidden curriculum" of teacher-pupil role expectations, teacher modeling, and the distribution of classroom space and materials.

Abstract = {Contends that American monolingual society has historically denied Mexican-Americans (MAs) and other ethnic groups their right to speak their mother language and examines how this has affected MAs' ability to communicate bilingually in a monolingual society. The Spanish language and culture are discussed as a historical process and in terms of their presence within the MA community. It is argued that the educational system has historically failed to provide sound, adequate curriculum and instruction for MAs and their bilingual/bicultural situation. Currently, bilingual education emphasizes the use of native culture and language as a medium of instruction and a regular feature of the school curriculum. It offers students of diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds the opportunity to learn the content of their mother tongue while learning English. It is argued that bilingual education has failed in some instances because of inadequate training of teachers and teacher aides, inadequate support from teachers and school administrators, and inadequate materials development. Parental involvement in bilingual education and their children's education should be encouraged by educational programs. The sociocultural significance of MA bilingualism is discussed.

Abstract = {This article investigates the cultural identities of adolescent immigrants in the pre-migration period and during the first 3 years after immigration. The target population consists of high-school Jewish adolescents from Russia and Ukraine participating in an Israeli immigration program. In this program, Jewish adolescents immigrate to Israel without their parents, live in kibbutzim and boarding schools, and study in Israeli schools. Participants filled out questionnaires four times: half a year before their departure from the homeland and once a year for three consecutive years after their arrival to Israel. Changes in the cultural identities during immigration were curvilinear. Three stages were distinguished: devaluation of the homeland and idealization of the country of immigration in the premigration period, disillusionment with the receiving country and strengthening of the homeland cultural identity in the first year after immigration, and the formation of an inconsistent bi-cultural identity in the later post-migration period. Throughout the entire post-migration period, immigrants’ attitude towards the receiving country was more positive than their attitude towards their homeland; however, immigrants’ sense of belonging to the homeland was stronger than their sense of belonging to the receiving country. Pre-migration cultural identities and perceived discrimination in the receiving country predicted postmigration cultural identities of immigrants. Immigrant adolescents from ethnically homogenous Jewish families had a less positive attitude towards Russia/Ukraine, a more positive attitude towards Israel, and a weaker sense of belonging to Russia/Ukraine as compared to immigrants from ethnically mixed families.

Reviews the book, Childhood Bilingualism: Aspects of Linguistic, Cognitive, and Social Development by Peter Homel, Michael Palij, and Doris Aaronson (Eds.) (see record [rid]1987-97788-000[/rid]). The essays collected in Childhood Bilingualism discuss a wide range of issues. Some focus on various political aspects of bilingualism such as language, social, and educational policies. Others examine if and how being immersed in a bilingual and bicultural environment may affect cognitive development and social development. Several essays address various linguistic and psycholinguistic issues, including language acquisition, language processing, and language comprehension. Overall, this book is a valuable source of references for research in this field. It also provides some fresh perspectives by integrating current and previous research.

Abstract = {The phenomenon of "new immigrants" or post-World War II immigrants from Asia and Latin America and the large birthrate of U.S.-born second-generation children have begun to change U.S. society with the visibility of people of color who are different from even those who have been traditionally considered as ethnic minorities in the United States. New immigrants constitute the majority of immigrants to this country. At the individual level of acculturation, a person must confront two general issues that are in opposition and may create conflict: (1) the maintenance and development of one's ethnic distinctiveness by retaining one's cultural identity, and (2) the desire to seek interethnic contact by valuing and maintaining positive relations with the dominant society. Subsumed in these dimensions are changes in multiple domains for immigrants: physical changes, biological changes, social relationships, language change, cognitive processes, personality, identity, cultural attitudes and values, and acculturative stress. Acculturation studies to date have been involved in the measurement of length of residence in the United States, age of entry into the United States, language change, ethnic identity, social behaviors and orientation, cultural attitudes and values, family differences, and generational differences. This writing describes the constructs and empirical findings in the measurement of acculturation and ethnic identity. Acceptable measures are identified and listed, and the measurement perspectives behind the development of these measures are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Discusses attempts at multicultural education in New Zealand. The historical pattern of cultural superiority and subordination established between the European migrants and the indigenous peoples of New Zealand has set the pattern for subsequent relationships with new migrants. Some attempts have been made to rectify this pattern by introducing the philosophies and practices of multiculturalism and biculturalism. However, such policies largely have not been successful because they ignored the importance of the need to address the relationship between the dominant Pakeha (people of European origin) and the indigenous population because the aspirations of the indigenous people are subsumed within the majority culture's designs for the future of New Zealand. Unless this relationships can be changed, the dominant–subordinate pattern of intercultural relationship will remain. Topics discussed include: development of the pattern of intercultural relationships, cultural assimilation as policy, integration as policy and the effect of urbanization of Maori children, multiculturalism and biculturalism, Maori educational incentives, and Maori autonomy. Implications for language education and the need for a language policy are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Explored some aspects of the subjective experience of individualism and collectivism in Israel, a society that simultaneously emphasizes both worldviews. Ss were Arab and Jewish Israeli students (Study 1 n = 211, Study 2 n = 370, Study 3 n = 160, and Study 4 n = 280). As hypothesized, endorsing individualism as a worldview was related to focusing on private aspects of the self and conceptualizing the self in terms of distinctions between the self and others. Hypotheses suggesting a relationship between collectivism, centrality of social identities to self-definition, a focus on public aspects of the self, and heightened perception of intergroup conflict were also supported by the data. Unexpectedly, endorsement of an individualistic worldview was also related to these variables. Discussion focuses on the meld of individualism and collectivism that may occur in Israel.

Abstract = {This article explores how younger members of a multigenerational social network of transnational Mexicans of ranchero background construct their ethnic identity both in offline and online contexts. By using traditional ethnography and discourse-centered online ethnography (DCOE), this study found that members of this network use four emic criteria (language, color, transnationality, and display of culture) to construct their ethnic identity as Mexican. In the online context, members use these criteria to challenge each other’s degree of Mexicanness. By challenging other members’ degree of Mexicanness, members are indirectly re-constructing their social order, not based on age and gender but based on a hierarchy that conforms to a place of influence in the network grounded in centrality, which correlates to their perceived degrees of Mexicanness. Facebook serves as a catalyst for change, as it allows members to interact in more direct ways, slowly influencing interactions carried out in offline contexts.

Even during this current academic year, I was cautioned not to write too much on testimonio and to maintain my focus on teacher formation across the continuum from teacher candidates to teacher educators.

Abstract = {Over the past 15 years, many state governments in Mexico have initiated local programs to introduce English at the primary school level. In 2009, the Mexican Ministry of Education formalized the Programa Nacional de Inglés en Educación Básica (PNIEB) as part of the national curriculum, based on the argument that increasing the number of English speakers in Mexico is necessary for the country to be globally competitive and to follow the trend in other developing economies of augmenting English instruction in public education. This paper focuses on the implementation of PNIEB and the state programs that preceded it. The authors document the practices and challenges associated with the program based on data collected from interviews with the main stakeholders involved (students and parents, teachers, school principals, and program coordinators) and from classroom observations. The total data-set consisted of over 200 interviews and classroom observations spread over several years from 2008 to 2012. Several challenges are described, including the development of materials, the role of English in relation to other subject areas, and the training of teachers who often speak English but have uneven formal preparation. The status of the teachers, both as second-class citizens within the schools and the instability and irregularities with their contracts, was identified as the most significant challenge to the successful implementation of the programs.

Abstract = {The current study examined the age of learning effect on second language (L2) acquisition. The research goals of the study were twofold: to test whether there is an independent age effect controlling for other potentially confounding variables, and to clarify the age effect across L2 grammar and speech production domains. The study included 118 Mandarin-speaking immigrants and 24 native English speakers. Grammar knowledge was assessed by a grammaticality judgment task, and speech production was measured by native English speaking raters’ ratings of participants’ foreign accents. Results from the study revealed that the age of learning effect was robust for both L2 domains even after controlling for the influences of other variables, such as length of residence and years of education in the United States. However, the age of learning variable had a stronger impact on speech production than on grammar. The current results support the framework of multiple critical/sensitive periods (Long in Int Rev Appl Linguist 43(4):287–317, 2005; Newport et al. in Language, brain and cognitive development: Essays in honor of Jacques Mehler.

Abstract = {Educational borderlands are the physical and/or conceptual landscapes where one must negotiate notions of cultural difference as she or he lives and learns—landscapes that envelop an array of pedagogical and cultural spaces, yet are typically guarded by exclusionary tactics. In this article, we examine how US immigrant youth navigate three educational borderlands: the geopolitical, institutional, and home community. We also discuss how educators’ biased ideologies and actions towards these youth solidify borders and increase inequity. Data from studies of California and North Carolina school communities allow us to extend border crossing theories and address how many immigrant youth confront and resist inequities, negotiate their cultural identities, and enact agency. While emphasizing that borderlands are sites of risk and transformation, we also suggest how educators can draw upon their relative power and privilege to cross borders too, advocate for immigrant youth, and ultimately improve education.

Abstract = {In this chapter we provide personal narrative, or the act of storytelling, as a way to chronicle the experience of school leadership. We look at the secondary literature, hyperlinks, and theoretical frameworks to serve as markers to illuminate how digital storytelling for critical self-reflection (DSCS) is used in the study of self, community, and curriculum. DSCS is useful as a tool to reconnect educators to their purpose for entering and remaining engaged in the educational process of individuals, communities, and organizations. The markers provide the necessary insight required for individuals to engage in an intentional and purposeful reflective process that partners with the technical aspects of digital storytelling. Digital storytelling has also been useful in framing staff development, youth leadership development, and community-building ventures. It has also been effective in community celebrations of student, family, and school accomplishments. School leaders have found this form of public expression useful in building school and community engagement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Based on a 3-year qualitative research study that took place in a new immigrant-receiving community in North Carolina, the manuscript examines the implications of transnational cultural and sociolinguistic patterns of multilingual indigenous Latino immigrants (ILIs), and its effects on their survival in the US. Utilizing narrative analysis, it explores how Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan immigrants of indigenous backgrounds use survival strategies of the Pedagogy of the Chameleon to move across multiple identities, both to maintain their cultures and to survive as immigrants in the United States. This manuscript explores the ways ILIs use strategies and skills passed through strong social networks to move in and out of transnational social spaces. In addition, it raises questions about the ways multilingualism affects border mobility and transnationality as well as how undocumented families use multilingualism as a transnational bridge to facilitate their survival in a hostile US environment, the community, and in schools.

Abstract = {The present study offers a cross-national, comparative analysis of deaf-education policies in Sweden and the United States and examines the ways in which these countries address status planning and acquisition planning for sign languages. Major policy documents were selected from each polity, reflecting key national legislative policies, as well as the primary texts that guide educational implementation: for Sweden, the Ordinance for Special Schools, the Education Act, and the national syllabi for special schools; for the United States, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Analysis of these texts shows that such planning tends to be explicit in Sweden but implicit in the United States. Moreover, the Swedish policies focus on the development of sign language/ national-language bilingualism, whereas the policies of the United States foreground assimilation to the hearing world; however, implementational space for sign language and multilingualism are present in the policies of both countries to varying degrees.

The results of factor analysis illustrated that the participants used six types of strategies: practicing naturalistically, associating, paying attention to the characters, using mechanical techniques, grouping, and paying attention to the pronunciation. The MANOVA test results found significant interactive effect between gender and home background on strategies of using mechanical techniques. Another interactive effect was found among gender, home background, and previous foreign language learning experiences on strategies of paying attention to the characters.

In response to current US teacher attrition rates, ATE–TAILC’s primary objective is to retain teachers in the classroom and provide support to ensure they are fully prepared to meet the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse students. In this manuscript, we will share the TAILC component as a support structure for teacher candidates/interns during the apprenticeship period, which commences while obtaining certification requirements and continues during/through their first years of teaching. Data were collected vis à vis surveys, individual and group interviews, and induction mentors’ classroom observations. Qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. We describe and discuss effective services and professional development activities provided to 69 novice teachers. We concluded that effective teacher induction support assists novice teachers through their zone of proximal development in becoming members of a community of practice.

Abstract = {In the wake of conversations about integrating macro- and micro-levels of linguistic analysis over the last 50 years, and following theoretical and methodological debates in the 1990s about investigating the dynamics of entire social systems, complexity theory is coming of age in educational linguistics. Central to the application of complexity theory in social science is its attention to multiple scales of social organisation and how they are connected through the actions of individuals, with an emphasis on the unfolding of social processes rather than on cause–effect relationships. This provides us with a new perspective that is increasingly being adopted in the development and implementation of multilingual education throughout the world, as seen in the simultaneous management of linguistic resources across different scales—national, regional, community, classroom, and interpersonal.

Video enhanced chatscripts produced by university learners of German (N = 23) engaged in dyadic task-based chat interaction were coded and analyzed for syntactic complexity (ratio of clauses to c-units), productive use of grammatical gender, and lexical diversity (Index of Guiraud). Results show that chat output that exhibits evidence of online planning in the form of post-production monitoring displays significantly greater linguistic complexity and lexical diversity than chat output that does not exhibit similar evidence of online planning. These findings suggest that L2 learners do appear to use the increased online (i.e. moment-by-moment) planning time afforded by chat to engage in careful production and monitoring.

Indeed, until quite recently, output logs have been favored almost exclusively at the expense of richer records of the interaction that can better account for this deleted text. Another basic aspect of SCMC interaction is the occurrence of interruptions initiated by one's interlocutor during the message composition phase. The possible effect of these interruptions on the chat interaction, however, has again been largely ignored in the literature. This study examines the relationship between these interruptions and deleted text as well as the effect such interruptions have on the subsequent output produced by learners.

This book is the author's response to such concerns, in a format targeting a lay audience. In this brief eight-chapter book, he introduces readers to popular beliefs regarding texting's impact on language, compares the linguistic features of texting to other forms of abbreviated language, explores the nature and function of texting, and outlines what research has shown so far regarding the relationship between texting and language use and development. Overall, the book is a quick and somewhat humorous overview of texting trends and research on texting generated over the past ten years, packaged in language accessible to the non-linguist.

In this chapter we focus on specific ways in which the ecology of language is fruitful for the study of multilingual educational LPP. We begin by reviewing the basic principles of the ecology of language as they were set forth by Einar Haugen and as they have been developed by researchers following in his footsteps. We then turn to a discussion of how these basic principles are applied to LPP scholarship, distilling core questions that are essential for ecologically oriented LPP research. Finally, we offer two case studies from our own research in the Andes and Sweden to illustrate the application of these core questions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

As an area of inquiry, educational linguistics is young. Its naissance occurred in the early 1970s with the work of Bernard Spolsky. The history of educational linguistics is inextricably linked to applied linguistics, with which it continues to have a symbiotic relationship. At the same time, educational linguistics has developed a unique niche in its directed focus on language and education.

Abstract = {The handbook of educational linguistics offers a scientifically grounded overview that provides guidance in dealing with the language education challenges produced by globalization and growing local multilingualism. From literacy to language acquisition and policy, this comprehensive text written by an international team of specialists gathers foundational information, core themes, major findings, and practical applications into one accessible volume. The 44 chapters provide state-of-the-art reviews of the many areas of inquiry that contribute to understanding the relationship between research and practice in language education. The volume considers the influence of neurobiology, psychology, anthropology, sociology, political science, educational studies, and linguistic sciences on a field which includes language teaching and learning, language policy, education of minorities and migrants, literacy, language curricula, assessment, and endangered languages. The book reveals the complexity of this growing field while remaining accessible for students, researchers, language educators, curriculum developers, and educational policy makers.

Abstract = {This article examines the lives of three transnational second-generation immigrant Latinas who reside in urban centers in California and maintain close ties to Mexico. Drawing from a participatory research and ethnographic study, I provide evidence of the out-of-school learning that they experience and how this shapes their notions of global citizenship. Although schools have begun to slowly recognize transnational immigrant students, many urban educators whose cities are palpably transformed by immigrants have not fully connected the promise of such a global lifestyle and its potential for instruction in the classroom.

Abstract = {The data in this article comes from a larger 3-year ethnographic study that examines the transnational immigrant lives of second-generation Latina youth whose families reside in northern California and maintain close ties to small rural communities in western Mexico. In the course of the study, three bilingual youth and I developed a participatory research project where students became researchers of their transnational communities. Findings depict how immigrant students use different language and literacy practices to represent themselves and author a meta-narrative about the U.S.-Mexico transnational experience. Family and community narratives are not only an iterative practice in this cross-border setting but also inscribed in certain household artifacts. This work suggests that sustained transnational contact with communities in Mexico provides linguistic and cultural resources for U.S. immigrant children that schools often overlook.

The publisher regrets that when the above article was printed, there were a series of errors in the text. The full correct article is printed with the erratum.] As part of the familiar three-turn sequence in pedagogical discourse, the third turn position in classroom talk is considered to play an important role in giving feedback on second turn answers produced by the students. The prior literature relies on functional categories to explain the relationship between teachers' third turn moves and student learning and yet, their analyses often take for granted the local exigencies embedded in the three turn sequence. In producing the third turn, classroom teachers come to terms with far more local and immediate contingencies than what is projected by blanket terms such as 'evaluation,' 'feedback,' or 'follow-up.' Following Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis, this paper examines and specifies the local contingencies that surround the teacher's third turn in order to bring into view the unforeseen range of the method of actions that teachers display. Based on 46 hours of ESL class room interactions, several collections of talk exchanges are analyzed to demonstrate how the third turn carries out the contingent task of responding to and acting on the prior turns while moving interaction forward. It is in these procedural aspects of interaction that we find the practical enactment of the classroom teachers' pedagogical work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Quantitative research in linguistics by Sebastian M. Rasinger (2008). Intended for both undergraduate and graduate students, this textbook presents a concise, clear, and well-illustrated introduction to the quantitative analysis of language. It is comprehensive and example-based, and it covers the basics of quantitative analysis of linguistic data and explores how this differs from qualitative approaches. At the same time, the book is also practical, helping the reader understand how to conceptualize, construct, and implement a quantitative investigation in linguistics. Overall, this excellent primer is a useful resource for a student needing to or thinking about starting a quantitative project in linguistics. The book will definitely capture students' interest and inspire them to move on and try using more complex statistical software such as SPSS or R in replicating and/or constructing innovative quantitative studies.

The book, written in a highly accessible style yet with careful attention to the complexity of the subject matter, includes twelve chapters in which thematic areas are explored through integrated discussion of key sociolinguistic concepts. Each chapter of this book clearly illustrates the discerning syntheses of major research findings and well chosen case study examples that "sociolinguists use a range of methods to analyse patterns of language in use and attitudes towards language in use". Despite the thorough treatment and integration of topics, there are a few missing elements that would have made this textbook even stronger in its coverage. The subject of language policy and planning (LPP) is situated within the broader discussion of multilingualism. In all, the book presents a core principles of sociolinguistics in concise and cogent prose well suited for a novice reader. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The concept of communicative competence is one of the most influential theoretical developments in language education as it helped redefine the objectives of L2 instruction and the target language proficiency. While acknowledging these contributions, this paper asks if the conceptual formulation of communicative competence has other relevancies for our understanding of the realities of language use in L2 instructional settings. Classroom interaction itself is an occasion of language use that relies on the competence of the parties to the interaction; the competence that is already in the room is then a constitutive feature of the work-practices of teaching and learning. Informed by Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis, this paper proposes that communicative competence may be as much the condition of L2 instruction, one that makes L2 instruction possible in the first place, as its target outcome. Brief analyses of transcripts from ESL classrooms are offered to demonstrate how the communicative competence found in L2 classrooms is a contingent resource for language teaching and learning.

Abstract = {Variation in the parts of ASL signs (i.e., phonological variation) has been explained largely by reference to the influence of the preceding and the following segments. This article examines three linguistic variables in ASL: the sign DEAF; the location of a class of signs represented by the verb KNOW; and signs produced with a 1 handshape. For all three of these variables, a multivariate analysis of more than nine thousand tokens extracted from videotaped conversations among 207 signers in seven sites across the United States shows that the grammatical function of a sign, rather than the features of the preceding or following signs, is the most important influence on a signer's choice among the variants. In addition to providing evidence for the role of this previously unexamined influence on variation in ASL, the results of this study highlight the importance of basing claims about the likely causes of variation on empirical studies of broadly representative samples of data collected in the language community.

Abstract = {Prior to entering a U.S. bilingual teacher preparation program, Mexican teachers (normalistas) were assessed regarding their ethnic identity, self-conceptualization, and teaching efficacy. The findings indicated that normalistas' ethnic identity is tied to country of origin, rather than their adopted country. Five salient conceptualization factors were identified: personality (carácter,), interests, occupational activity, interpersonal style, and moral worth. The multivariate regression analysis of self-concept and teacher efficacy constructs showed that the participants' view of self, specifically character, and moral worth may affect their teacher efficacy (p<.05). Researchers suggest that teacher preparation programs focus on the development and enhancement of normalistas' sociopolitical awareness to ensure understanding of U.S. language minority students' educational needs.

Abstract = {In the United States, a multiethnic society with coexistent, variant conceptions of literacy, Puerto Rican individuals are engaged in the creation of cultural identities while becoming literate (Ferdman, 1991). The defining of self--as an individual, as part of a group, and in relation to the cultural image embedded in the literacy program--occurs in the context of the power relationships established with the U.S. society and from its colonial relationship with Puerto Rico. Given the scarcity of information and the complexity of the relationship, I present a profile of literacy among Puerto Rican children. The profile is embedded in a perspective that views literacy as socially constructed and through which cultural values, standards, behaviors, and practices are communicated intergenerationally and renegotiated in social interactions among adults, between adults and children, and among children at play, at home, in school, and in church and other community settings (Pérez & Torres-Guzmán, 1996). Of particular importance is the group's core values in relation to language. The chapter ends by exploring programs in which literacy has been organized ideologically (Street, 1992) with the dynamism and the complexity of the conditions of Puerto Ricans in the United States in mind. The discussion of these examples serves to highlight the viability of some recommendations made in the educational policy literature on effective ways of educating Puerto Rican and Latino children.

For teacher educators, the question is whether teacher preparation should include the development and enhancement of a positive self-image in teachers and should provide teachers with the techniques necessary to promote a positive ethnic identity in their students. A preliminary study was conducted focusing on Latino teachers' ethnicity labels and self-conceptualizations. The questions addressed are: How do bilingual teachers identify themselves ethnically, and what are their self-conceptualizations? And is there a within-group difference in how these Latino teachers identify themselves? The findings show that there is a strong association between ethnic identity and self-concept and that there are group differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},
