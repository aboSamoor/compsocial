Abstract = {A body of literature has increased our understanding of ethnic identity formation among ethnic minorities, but there remains a dearth of research focused on the ethnic identity formation of biethnic adolescents. Biethnic adolescents are likely to have unique experiences related to ethnicity that significantly alter the course of their ethnic identity formation. As such, a conceptual framework of biethnic identity is needed to guide future empirical work on biethnic identity and, ultimately, increase the field’s understanding of this critical developmental process among biethnic adolescents. This article provides a review of theoretical and empirical work on ethnic identity among monoethnic adolescents, and, guided by the cultural ecological framework, an ecological framework of biethnic identity development is proposed.

Abstract = {Objective: To describe the prevalence and associations of bed- and sofa-sharing in a biethnic UK birth cohort. Methods: We surveyed 3082 participants in the Born in Bradford birth cohort study by using a telephone interview when infants were aged 2 to 4 months. We asked families about sleep surface sharing behaviors, and other sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI)-related behaviors. Results: There were 15.5% of families that had ever bed-shared, 7.2% of families regularly bed-shared, and 9.4% of families had ever sofa-shared with their infants; 1.4% reported both. Regular bed-sharers were more commonly Pakistani (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.96–4.66), had further or higher educational qualifications (aOR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.03–2.57), or breastfed for at least 8 weeks (aOR = 3.06, 95% CI 2.00–4.66). The association between breastfeeding and bed-sharing was greater among white British than Pakistani families. Sofa-sharing occurred in association with smoking (aOR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.14–2.80) and breastfeeding for more than 8 weeks (aOR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.19–2.58), and was less likely in Pakistani families (aOR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.14–0.31), or single-parent families (aOR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.29–0.87). Conclusions: The data confirm that bed-sharing and sofa-sharing are distinct practices, which should not be combined in studies of unexpected infant deaths as a single exposure. The determinants of sleep-surface sharing differ between the UK Pakistani and UK majority communities, and from those of US minority communities. Caution is needed in generalizing SUDI/SIDS risk factors across populations with differing risk factor profiles, and care should be taken in adopting SUDI/SIDS reduction guidelines from other contexts.

Abstract = {Three focus groups of Biethnic individuals who, for the most part, grew up in Japan were conducted. A total of 13 Biethnic individuals participated. Cooley's Looking-glass Self Theory was used as our theoretical framework. Cooley argued that in the same way we look into a mirror to discover our appearance, we see ourselves through the eyes of other people. Therefore, other people's reactions largely influence the way we see ourselves. This hypothesis was supported by our focus group data; all respondents regarded themselves as Biethnic only after others pointed it out to them. Our results were in some ways similar to existing Biracial identity models. We, too, found that there were multiple responses to being Biracial. We called them: Unique Me, Model Biethnic, and Just Let Me Be Japanese. Like other researchers, we also found that various factors were influential in shaping Biracial identity. Ethnicity of the non-Japanese parent, family structure, and living environment seemed to have largely shaped our respondents' experiences.

Abstract = {Background: Mexican Americans (MAs) have an increased risk of stroke compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), especially at younger ages. Little is known regarding patterns of familial aggregation of stroke and whether familial risk assessment might prove a potentially useful tool in assessing stroke risk in this population. This study's objective was to estimate the sibling recurrence risk ratio (λs) for stroke and to compare this ratio between MAs and NHWs. Methods: Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) cases (n = 181) between the ages of 45 and 64 years were identified by a population-based stroke study in a biethnic Texas community. λs was calculated overall and by ethnicity. Results: Siblings of ischemic stroke/TIA cases had a doubling in stroke risk compared to what would be expected based on national stroke prevalence estimates (λs = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.39-2.61). λs was 2.0 (95% CI: 1.39-2.81) among MA stroke/TIA cases and 1.66 (95% CI: 0.82-3.10) among NHW stroke/TIA cases. Conclusion: The sibling recurrence risk for stroke was elevated in MA stroke/TIA cases suggesting that further ischemic stroke genetic studies across ethnicities may be warranted. In addition, a positive family history could prove a useful factor in the clinical setting for identifying MAs at increased stroke risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

The present study addresses this gap by examining the role of alcohol-related problems and anger as correlates of marital satisfaction among newlywed monoethnic Latino couples (n = 13), biethnic Latino couples (n = 28), and European American couples (n = 89). Higher self-reported anger by both spouses predicted lower marital satisfaction for all couples. Ethnicity interacted with husbands' alcohol-related problems in predicting husbands' marital satisfaction in monoethnic Latino couples. Ethnicity interacted with husbands' anger in the prediction of wives' marital satisfaction in biethnic Latino couples. Conclusions and implications for treatment and research are discussed.

Abstract = {The extent to which the construct of body image is measurement invariant across ethnic groups is an important consideration for studies examining ethnic differences and characteristics that influence body image disturbances. However, the literature examining the body image construct as a function of ethnic group membership is limited. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether Hispanic/biethnic-Hispanic and non-Hispanic White preadolescent girls (aged 8 through 12 years old; N = 141) had fundamentally different conceptualizations of body image in a low to low/middle socioeconomic status school-based sample. Our findings suggest that the measurement construct of body image was similar and relatively stable for Hispanic/biethnic-Hispanic and non-Hispanic White preadolescent girls. In addition, the body image construct was predictably related to disordered eating symptoms in both groups, with different dimensions of body image differentially predictive by ethnic group. Overall, body image appears to be a meaningful construct with similar measurement meanings across Hispanic/biethnic-Hispanic and non-Hispanic White ethnic groups.

Three cohorts were established: 173 students taught by a resource teacher, 170 students taught by classroom teachers, and 187 students who did not receive the curriculum. Pre- and posttest surveys measured outcomes, and classroom teachers were observed and interviewed. The curriculum was shown to be effective in enhancing student outcomes for both the resource teacher and classroom teacher cohorts. Teachers reported that lessons needed to be simplified and that children enjoyed them. Findings support the transferability of an urban-based nutrition curriculum to a rural community and the need for students to receive health education annually.

Abstract = {This article presents a study which aims to compare the barriers to physical activity reported by persons with diabetes (PwD) and those without diabetes in a large, rural, biethnic population-based sample. Using 5-point Likert scales, seven barriers to physical activity were assessed as the extent to which participants would increase their physical activity if the barrier were absent. Using t tests, chi-square, and ANOVA procedures, it was found that PwD walked less and were less active than those without diabetes even when controlling for age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity. While this study was limited by the relatively small number of PwD in the sample and reliance on self-report measures of behavior and clinical diagnosis, the use of population-based recruitment in a rural, biethnic sample are strengths. Further, the findings provide direction for counseling and messaging around physical activity for PwD. Specifically, diabetes care providers should ask patients about their fear of injury so that these fears can be addressed when providing physical activity recommendations.

Abstract = {Primarily because of underutilized schools (caused by declining enrollments) and the need to address budgetary deficits brought on by dramatic reductions in average daily attendance, many public school districts, in decades past and the present, have been forced to close numerous schools across the nation. The school boards of these economically troubled districts have resorted to consolidation to help alleviate their financial woes. In highly segregated biethnic or triethnic districts, school boards continue to struggle in deciding which schools to close. The closures of schools with high enrollments of Mexican American or other Latino students who are of low socioeconomic status and who are English language learners are particularly problematic, given their vulnerability for school failure. This article involves a case study of 1 such school proposed for closure, Park Oaks Elementary School in the Conejo Valley Unified School District (Southern California). Via activist scholarship, I relate how my efforts in documenting a goodness of fit at Park Oaks Elementary School proved successful in preventing the school from being closed. A major implication stemming from this study is that educational equality for Latino students and their parents can be achieved without having to resort to litigation. Unfortunately, months after this article was accepted for publication I received some very bad news that the school board reneged on its decision not to close Park Oaks. I explain these events in the Epilogue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Broome and Anastasiou provide details and insights into the causes and consequences of interethnic conflict in Cyprus by examining both historical and recent events. Attention is given to efforts over the years to bring about peaceful resolution. While results to negotiate a settlement have been not resulted in a successful agreement, encouragement may be found in the ongoing activities of civil-society groups that are actively working to promote contact and build understanding among people from across Cypriot society. Analysis of the conflict's origins begins with a description of the movement by Greek Cypriots in the 1950s against British colonial rule. The authors describe how the biethnic republic created in 1960 quickly fell apart, with events in 1974 leading to a geographic division of the island along ethnic lines. The authors explore the conflicts that led to this division, and while there are many contributing factors, the role of extreme nationalism is given particular emphasis. A summary is provided of efforts by the international community to mediate the conflict, which today is in a protracted stalemate. Exploring the multiple areas through which peace is being promoted, descriptions are provided of interactive problem-solving workshops, conflict resolution training, seminars to promote dialogue, cultural events, and a variety of collaborative projects. The perseverance of the bi-communal groups, which have continued to work towards peace despite many obstacles, provides a sense of hope for the future. Broome and Anastasiou explore the contributions of peace-building activities at the personal, relational, and structural levels. The chapter concludes by discussing implications for ethnic conflicts, including the need to balance international and local input into peace-building, to anchor civil-society initiatives in societal institutions, and to actively develop links between official and unofficial efforts toward peace.

Patients and Methods: We included in the study 546 patients (counting warfarin-related hemorrhages) hospitalized during the period from December 1999 through June 2008. Results: The mean age was 71.1 ± 14 years for the Jewish patients and 63.3 ± 13.9 years for the Arab patients (p < 0.0001). Diabetes and smoking were significantly more frequent among the Arab patients. No difference was found between groups by location, extent, or ventricular involvement of PICH. Although the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher among the Jewish patients, adjustment of the model combining multiple risk factors for PICH eliminated this difference. Conclusions: There are differences in the demographic and vascular risk factor profiles between Arab and Jewish PICH patients, with the Arabs found to be younger and to suffer more from diabetes. The location and extent of intracerebral hemorrhage as well as functional outcome were similar between the two groups. The apparent higher in-hospital mortality in the group of Jewish patients was eliminated when the influence of multiple covariates other than ethnicity, main vascular risk factors and international normalized ratio level were taken into consideration.

Ethnicity was not found to moderate the relation between marital conflict and family functioning, and greater levels of marital conflict were associated with disengaged family interactions and also with lax or inconsistent parenting. Implications for understanding cross-ethnic issues in family systems and child adjustment are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Inflammatory processes are implicated in a number of diseases for which there are known socioeconomic status (SES) disparities, including heart disease and diabetes. Growing evidence also suggests SES gradients in levels of peripheral blood markers of inflammation. However, we know little about potential gender and racial/ethnic differences in associations between SES and inflammation, despite the fact that the burden of inflammation-related diseases varies by gender and race. The present study examines SES (education and income) gradients in levels of two inflammatory biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in a biethnic (White and Black) sample of men and women (n = 3549, aged 37–55 years) in the USA from the CARDIA Study. Health status, behavioral and psychosocial variables that may underlie SES differences in inflammatory biomarker levels were also examined. Age-adjusted CRP and IL-6 levels were inversely associated with education level in each race/gender group except Black males. Income gradients were also observed in each race/gender group for IL-6 and in White females and males for CRP. In general, differences in CRP and IL-6 levels between low and high SES groups were reduced in magnitude and significance with the addition of health status, behavioral, and psychosocial variables, although the impact of the addition of model covariates varied across race/gender groups and different SES-inflammation models. Overall, findings indicate SES gradients in levels of inflammation burden in middle-aged White and Black males and females. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to report the process outcomes of a coaching methodology used in a study designed to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity in families. Eighty-eight families with second graders were recruited from a rural, biethnic community in Colorado and randomized to intervention and delayed intervention conditions. This article reports on the 27 families in the delayed intervention group. Families received up to 10 home visits over 10 months from a family advisor and completed activities to improve their dietary and physical activity behaviors. Coaching conversations took place during each home visit. Coaching process outcomes were evaluated by analysis of visit documentation, participant survey, and qualitative interviews. Results indicated that coaching, in conjunction with family activities, engaged families in the process of change and facilitated movement toward the achievement of their weekly nutrition or physical activity goals. Coaching methodology may be particularly useful for participatory research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Menthol smoking may influence the development of tobacco addiction and related health consequences, yet limited data on menthol smoking by youth are available. We assessed usual brand menthol preference by Baltimore-area teenage smokers applying to a smoking cessation study between September 1999 and December 2002. Of a biethnic (Black and White) sample of 593 youths (mean age= 15.5±1.4 years, 51% female, 45% African American), the overwhelming majority (93%) were menthol smokers. Menthol preference rates were highest among African American girls and lowest among White boys. Overall, a statistically significant association was found between ethnicity and menthol preference, χ² (df= 1) = 19.4,p<.001. This association also was observed separately for girls, χ² (df=1) = 9.21, p = .0024, and for boys, χ² (df) = 9.59, p = .0020. Menthol smoking did not vary with age in either ethnic group. These findings of overwhelming menthol preference in a treatment-seeking sample of adolescents warrant further research on the developmental trajectory, cessation, and health-related impact of menthol smoking by youth.

Abstract = {Evaluated the relationship between hopelessness and mortality in a biethnic cohort of older community-dwelling Mexican Americans, the most rapidly growing segment of the elderly, and European Americans. A total of 795 persons (aged 64–79 yrs) completed an English or Spanish version of the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale on entering the San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging, an epidemiologic survey, between 1992–1996. Women constituted 58% and Mexican Americans 54% of this randomly selected sample. Ss who answered "no" to the item "Are you hopeful about the future?" were classified as hopeless. As of August 1999, 29% of the 73 hopeless Ss had died, compared with 11% of the hopeful. The mortality rates for cardiovascular disease and cancer were significantly greater among the hopeless Ss than among the hopeful. Hopelessness predicted all-cause mortality in a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, ethnic background, current smoking status, number of comorbid medical conditions, self-rated health, and frequency of social contacts. Neither sex nor probable depression was a significant predictor of mortality in this model. Results suggest that hopelessness is a significant predictor of mortality in older and middle-aged adults of various ethnic backgrounds.

Abstract = {Compared functioning in biracial youth to white adolescents and other minority adolescents. Data was drawn from the core sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The Add Health public-use data set includes interviews of 6,504 adolescents and 4,600 parents. On the Add Health survey, adolescents were asked multiple questions to assess their racial/ethnic background. Results suggest that biracial/biethnic youth are a particularly vulnerable group in terms of self-reported delinquency, school problems, internalizing symptoms, and self-regard. As a group, they are also more likely to receive some form of psychological intervention. Given these findings and the shortcoming of clinical resources for work with this population, the authors provide a discussion of why biracial youth may be particularly vulnerable from a social constructionist framework and offer several strategies based on narrative family therapy for working with biracial youngsters and their families. The list of items used in making up variables in analyses is appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Hernandez [1992]) dealing with biethnic identity development was explored. This multicase study charted students' literary engagement in an urban technology magnet school and a rural Hawaii high school. Analyses of 7 students' journal freewriting, character interpretation dialogue journals, and research papers on the novel's cultural authenticity revealed that students (1) produced more personal and interpretive reactions to the novel than simple descriptions of events and (2) had a strong sense of agency and voice, supported by reader-based teaching. Students need to have opportunities to read and talk about literature that explores ethnic and cultural identity development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study estimates the prevalence of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use in a nationally representative sample of monoracial/ethnic and biracial/ethnic youth and young adults. The authors consider 16 racial/ethnic categories and used four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The analysis sample consists of 20,745 individuals in Wave 1. The primary statistical methodology used in the present study is logistic regression with sample weights. Findings suggest that participants who self-report two races/ethnicities have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates. For example, Black-American Indians reported cigarette smoking rates that were significantly lower than rates reported by American Indians but significantly higher than rates reported by Blacks. Groups with the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking at Wave 1 were American Indian, White-American Indian, White, and Multiracial (people reporting three or more races/ethnicities). Groups with the highest prevalence of alcohol drinking at Wave 1 were White-American Indian, Multiracial, Hispanic, White, and White-Hispanic. Groups with the highest prevalence of marijuana smoking at Wave 1 were Black-Asian and American Indian. The authors found an interaction effect between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Lower-class SES status may serve as a risk factor for biracial/ethnic adolescents while upper-class SES may serve as a protective factor for these youth. In general, biracial/ethnic individuals have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates.

Abstract = {Examined the prevalence of violent behaviors among Mexican-American and non-Hispanic White high school students and explored the associations between violent behaviors and alcohol and illicit drug use. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey was administered to 1,617 high school students in a biethnic community in Southeast Texas; 65% were Mexican-American and 26% were non-Hispanic White. Results show that there were no significant ethnic differences in prevalence of drinking alcohol, illicit drug use, fighting, carrying a weapon, or planning or attempting suicide. After adjustment for age, carrying a weapon and fighting were significantly associated with alcohol and illicit drug use, with few exceptions, among the 4 gender- and ethnic-specific subgroups. However, the relationship between suicide (plans and attempts) and substance use among the 4 subgroups was less consistent and of much lower magnitude than for carrying a weapon and fighting. It is concluded that a systematic and integrated approach to changing the environment and norms of communities is needed to affect change and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with violent behaviors.

Results showed that more extensive cocaine use experience was linked with being White, older and less educated, regardless of sex. Higher levels of licit and illicit substance use behavior were reported by those reporting more extensive cocaine experience; however, most cardiovascular disease risk factors such as systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, hypertension, physical activity and anthropometric measurements were not related to lifetime cocaine experience. In this age group, the detrimental cardiovascular effects of cocaine may be limited to acute effects. Further studies are needed to determine whether continued exposure is related to cardiovascular disease risk factors later in life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Although individual ethnic identity change in the Andes is common, it usually requires geographic mobility and deception or occurs in contexts of intermediate ethnic groups and ill-defined ethnic boundaries. The authors conducted a 19-yr longitudinal case study of the biethnic southern Ecuadorian parish of Saraguro, where transculturation from the sharply defined ethnic status of indígena ("Indian") to that of blanco (White) does not require moving away or deceit, is favored by members of the dominant group (blancos), and is undertaken primarily by individuals located at the lowest socioeconomic levels of indígena society. In spite of the openness of ethnic boundaries, the rate of indígena to blanco transculturation has been low and is now decreasing further. Two mutually reinforcing factors have contributed to low transculturation rates: a resurgence of ethnic consciousness and pride and the recent opening of educational and occupational opportunities for indígenas in Ecuador. The resultant reshaping of ethnocultural boundaries is described. (3 p ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The anthropological literature generally depicts Mesoamerican Indian communities as egalitarian. This study reveals and examines the dramaturgical nature of egalitarianism among Indians of Teopisca, a biethnic (Ladino-Mayan) town in southern Mexico. It is shown that although much public behavior in this community complies with the moral prescriptions of an egalitarian ideology, such behavior normally serves instrumental rather than moral ends. Following discussion of this ideology and related categories of deviance and defensive interactional tactics, it is proposed that Indian egalitariansim in Teopisca is itself a collective construction of reality designed to assist in the task of self-esteem maintenance in the face of underprivilege and depreciation within the larger Ladino-dominated community. The broader contribution of this study lies in its demonstration of ways in which culture--qua morality--relates to behavior through the medium of actors' everyday practical social interests and concerns.
