Abstract = {We review limitations of the traditional paradigm for cultural research and propose an alternative framework, polyculturalism. Polyculturalism assumes that individuals’ relationships to cultures are not categorical but rather are partial and plural; it also assumes that cultural traditions are not independent, sui generis lineages but rather are interacting systems. Individuals take influences from multiple cultures and thereby become conduits through which cultures can affect each other. Past literatures on the influence of multiple cultural identities and cultural knowledge legacies can be better understood within a polyculturalist rubric. Likewise, the concept elucidates how cultures are changed by contact with other cultures, enabling richer psychological theories of intercultural influence. Different scientific paradigms about culture imply different ideologies and policies; polyculturalism’s implied policy of interculturalism provides a valuable complement to the traditional policy frames of multiculturalism and colorblindness.

Abstract = {The issues of social, cultural, and language adjustment and the integration of repatriates into the Kazakhstani society are crucial factors in maintaining a stable society. The complicated process of self-identification of ethnic Kazakhs is a major aspect of their sociolinguistic “penetration” into Kazakh society. In this work we consider the formative process of the ethnolinguistic identification as Kazakhstani repatriates. We also analyze the complex language situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan and the language policy of the country toward the Kazakh diaspora in other countries. The results of our sociolinguistic experiment of 1,000 repatriates are presented in this article. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the affordances of polylingual and polycultural learning ecologies in expanding the linguistic repertoires of children, particularly young Dual Language Learners. In contrast to settings that promote the development of English and academic language at the expense of maintaining and developing home language, we argue that the social organization of learning should privilege participation in dynamic, hybrid literacy practices. Children are often more likely to experiment with English and academic genres, while also taking on powerful identities as learners and language users, when formal and informal modes of communication are leveraged, multimodality and language-crossing encouraged and the use of both home and academic vernaculars promoted within a context that values social relationships and the playful imagination. We argue that children’s literacy practices develop in particular social and ‘located’ relationships, and we examine one such after-school setting designed with these principles in mind, the long-standing UC Links/Las Redes partnership, where home languages and intercultural experiences are unmarked and necessarily integral to participating in the shared practices of the community. We highlight the affordance of one common practice of the community, childrens communication with the mythical cyber wizard, El Maga (sic), and the ways this practice strategically draws on students full linguistic toolkits in order to invite them to integrate modes and genres of communication that challenge the divide between everyday and school-based literacies, stretching children beyond their current levels of literacy development.

Abstract = {Scholars have long explored the colorblind and multicultural ideological approaches to improving intergroup attitudes and relations. Polyculturalism, a newly studied ideological approach, focuses on the past and current interactions and connections among different racial and ethnic groups. Drawing on cross‐disciplinary work, we critically examine the various forms that each of these ideological approaches has taken across studies, and their implications for intergroup attitudes and relations among racially and ethnically diverse children, adolescents, and adults. Although each ideological approach has been examined in several ways (often combining different forms of each approach), there is sufficient comparative work to draw some conclusions. We propose that a combined ideological approach be implemented in educational settings that maximizes the strengths and positive intergroup consequences of colorblindness, multiculturalism, and polyculturalism, while minimizes the weaknesses and negative intergroup consequences of each approach.

@article{2012-30168-01320121101,
Abstract = {Fundamental features of mutualisms are solutions to conflict. The mutualism between fungus-gardening ants and their fungi is characterized by pronounced evolutionary ant-fungus fidelity. Ant-fungus fidelity is thought to be controlled by the fungus, which secretes somatic incompatibility compounds that suppress incompatible fungal strains that may invade gardens. Accordingly, the ants are thought to perceive incompatibilities and then reject invading cultivars. During cultivar-switch experiments, we discovered that if switched colonies of the ant Trachymyrmex septentrionalis are successful in retaining a minute fragment of their original garden, the ants will gradually co-cultivate the novel and the original fungus strains in a chimeric (polycultural) garden; this chimeric garden will revert after 1–2 weeks completely to a monoculture of the original fungal strain. Experimental examination of worker preference suggests that symbiont rejection behavior seems to be an innate response toward foreign fungi rather than mediated solely by incompatibility compounds secreted by the fungus. These observations suggest that the fungal strain cultivated by a colony imprints the attending ants, and this imprinting modifies ant behavior so that the ants prefer their original cultivar even when experimentally forced to grow a foreign cultivar for several weeks. Fungal monocultures and ant-fungus fidelities in this symbiosis therefore seem to be reinforced by factors intrinsic to both the ants and the fungi.

Abstract = {This chapter discusses hypocrisy in politics from variety of perspectives, including that of Andrew Samuels, who proposes a dialogue of diversities—in addition to Arendt's harmonious co-existence of the different, and Baumann's postulated universalism—a polycultural society that embraces differences and the capacity to communicate and reach mutual understanding, 'a communion of meanings'. The problem posed by political hypocrisy is less that of knowing whether it would be licit to use subterfuges to affirm power, particularly if the objective is some common good. The relevant question is the manipulation that stifles the conscience and the iatrogenics inherent to this procedure: loss of the capacity of moral judgment, the ethical discernment that leads us to the discovery of possible answers to our dilemmas and challenges. Recognizing the personalities that rely on manipulation, whether conscious or narcissistic or else the result of some other personality disorder, would be an instrument against alienation and accommodation, against the skidding of these hyper-modern times on the deafening and bewildering race-track to the void.
