Abstract = {One of the aims of this chapter is to shed light on gender and culture studies in Russian psychology, which have been neglected in the literature at a global level. Our chapter also aims to provide a survey of gender and culture studies in a polyethnic Russian context. We take as a starting point the perspective that the interaction of culture and gender is based on the intersection of multiple influences: biological differences and psychological characteristics, as well as cultural practices, and ecological, social, political, and historical factors. In our analysis, we will view gender differences from the perspective of a number of psychological constructs, in line with Best and Williams' work. The goal of this chapter is to present a comparative analysis of various ethnic groups living in Russia with regard to characteristics relating to gender issues.

Abstract = {This chapter discusses mixed-race in the decennial UK census and whether the approaches sustainable in the age of globalization and super-diversity. Multiethnic states such as Britain face various challenges in the classification and enumeration of ethnic minority, populations in the future due to two main demographic changes. First, in the new global migration, many of the new-migrant groups have no link historically or culturally to Britain's colonial past, but comprise what Kymlicka calls "polyethnic minorities." Second, a significant growth in mixed partnerships and people, and their increasingly diverse modes of identification, poses key questions about the validity and reliability of official classifications. Understandings of "race" and the significance of ethnic and racial difference are not only changeable across time, but are also sensitive to specific contexts and localities. Understandings of "race" and "mixed race" are moving targets, and thus there is always a potential disjuncture between ordinary understandings and practices "on the ground," and official measures of such complex phenomena. Where there is a need for data on the ethnic diversity of the population, new forms of data collection are needed. At a population group level, multiticking probably offers the best opportunity, in spite of concerns about data quality and response stability. However, "origins-based 'groupness'" may best be captured by an ancestry or ethnic origins question of the type that has been asked in the US and Canadian censuses.

Abstract = {The authors question whether ethnic separatism is the inevitable consequence of pursuing policies that allow for a reflowering of subnational ethnic identities, as in Quebec, or if there are ways of having both a strong sense of attachment to one's own while still fostering loyalty to the larger state, as some variants of pluralist theory would have it. This article describes a comparative study of the relationship between attachment to the individual ethnic group and loyalty to the larger country. Research on the relationship between strength of ethnic attachments and loyalty to the country as a whole impinges on the political wisdom of choosing public policies from affirmative action, to bilingual education to political autonomy for subregional groups. The comparative politics literature is fraught with assumptions about the nature of this relationship, but few studies have tried to empirically estimate it. The authors test pluralist, melting pot, and ethnic dominance models of ethnic attachment and overall levels of patriotism in the US and 4 other polyethnic states. The data are derived from a 1995 ISSP National Identity Survey and the 1990–93 World Values Survey. Mixed support is found for the alternative models.

Abstract = {In a polyethnic sample of 832 consecutive new outpatients attending a private psychiatric clinic in Dubai, drug and alcohol related problems were highly represented among nationals. Nationals constitute around 20% of the general population in Dubai and 47.7% of the whole patient population of the clinic but constitute 80.6% of all substance abuse cases. Substance abuse patients were mostly male, younger adults, less educated and more unemployed than other psychiatric outpatients. The study confirms earlier observations indicating higher substance abuse among nationals frequenting psychiatric services. Heroin-related problems are more common than alcohol-related problems in outpatients. A social causation hypothesis based on the stresses resulting from major socioeconomic changes during the latter three decades may explain these findings.

Abstract = {In recent years there has been a dramatic rise in the number of comparative studies of groups within culturally plural nation states. There are 2 models that may serve as frameworks for guiding such research—the unicultural and the cross-cultural. An argument is advanced that research in plural societies requires a new model, one that draws primarily upon the cross-cultural model, reflecting an ideology of cultural pluralism, so that the independence and uniqueness of each group in the comparison may be respected. A transethnic model is proposed for conducting comparative studies of ethunits in polyethnic societies. Guidelines for assessing issues of comparability, group independence, and the number of groups in the comparison and their cultural characteristics are discussed.

Abstract = {Examines the polyethnic behavior of termites in 5 experiments. The cephalic gland defensive secretion of the nasute soldiers produced short-term recruitment of only soldiers to loci where it was present. Workers reacted to the secretion by remaining in or retreating to the nest. The sternal gland secretion of workers and soldiers acted in long-term recruitment of soldiers when presented as a point source, a trail, or a trail with a food source at its end. This secretion caused more exiting soldiers than the cephalic gland secretion and was more effective in this regard as a trail than as a point source. The greater numbers exiting in the trail situation may be related to the greater amount of pheromone area present and the halting of soldiers at the pheromone odor boundary. The greatest number of soldiers exited when the trail was coupled with a food source at its end, and in this situation workers exited for the 1st time in significant numbers. Additional information about the food source is postulated to be communicated by tactile means (jittering), and it is suggested that this lowers the threshold for the trail-following responses in Ss such that worker exiting is initiated.

Abstract = {Recent work on cognitive domains has stressed the themes of intracultural variability, "larger cultural informational systems," relationships between cognition and behavioral performance, and diachronic change in cognitive organization. These themes are taken up in an analysis of the domain of ethnic identities (tribes) among an urban Ghanaian population. It is shown that (a) individual outlooks vary considerably; (b) few of the many ethnic terms have high salience; (c) alternative hierarchical and nonhierarchical modes of organization of the domain coexist; (d) a widely shared implicit structure of language groupings underlies surface diversity; (e) the domain "tribes" embraces a world-wide array of ethnic identities; (f) cognitive salience and structure correspond closely, but not perfectly, with behavioral experience; and (g) change in cognitive organization may arise both "on the ground" through changing patterns of interethnic relations, and "from above" in state-sponsored modes of organization of the ethnic domain. 12 dimensions of cognitive variability that arise in the analysis are summarized.
