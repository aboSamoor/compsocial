Abstract = {Although the biracial population is expected to grow at astonishing rates in the upcoming decades across North America, rigorous quantitative psychological research on biracial identity is currently scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine biracial identity profiles in a large sample of Asian-White biracial young adults (n = 330; aged 18–30) living in the United States and Canada, as well as assess the interrelationships among biracial identity and psychological adjustment variables. Grounded in the expanded theoretical model of Multiracial Heritage Awareness and Personal Affiliation (M-HAPA: Choi-Misailidis, 2004) and its corresponding biracial identity measure, cluster analysis was conducted to evaluate participants’ ‘patterns’ or ’profiles’ of scores on biracial identity orientation subscales. Three unique biracial identity groups emerged: the Asian-White Integrated, the Asian Dominant, and the White Dominant groups. Between-groups differences on participants’ measures of cultural socialization, psychological distress, and internalized oppression were analyzed and compared. The Asian-White Integrated group reported more cultural socialization than the other 2 groups. Furthermore, Asian Dominant participants showed the highest levels of psychological distress, whereas White Dominant participants showed the highest levels of internalized oppression among all groups. The results lend empirical support to the study’s hypotheses and the M-HAPA model. Theoretical, conceptual, and methodological implications for future biracial identity research are discussed.

Abstract = {We investigated whether Black–White biracial individuals are perceived as Black in the domain of evaluation. Previous research has documented that White perceivers’ negative evaluation of one Black person leads to a negative implicit evaluation of another Black person belonging to the same minimal group. We built upon this out-group transfer effect by investigating whether perceivers also transferred negative implicit attitudes from one Black person to a novel Black–White biracial person. In three experiments, participants learned about a Black individual who performed undesirable behaviors and were then introduced to a new group member. White perceivers formed negative attitudes toward the original individual and transferred these attitudes to the new group member if she was Black or Biracial, but not if she was White (Experiment 1) or Asian (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 demonstrated that only White participants exhibited transfer to the new Black and Biracial group members; Black participants did not.

This study, utilizing a qualitative design, explored racial identity development of biracial Afro-Germans living in Germany. The purpose of the study was to understand the strategies that biracial individuals use to negotiate their racial identity, factors that influence their development, cultural influences, and racial socialization processes. Interviews with biracial Afro-Germans were conducted using phenomenological interviewing techniques. Twelve themes emerged from the data that are best conceptualized in an ecological model.

Abstract = {Research has shown that priming one’s racial identity can alter a biracial individuals’ social behavior, but can such priming also influence their speech? Language is often used as a marker of one’s social group membership and studies have shown that social context can affect the style of language that a person chooses to use, but this work has yet to be extended to the biracial population. Audio clips were extracted from a previous study involving biracial Black/White participants who had either their Black or White racial identity primed. Condition-blind coders rated Black-primed biracial participants as sounding significantly more Black and White-primed biracial participants as sounding significantly more White, both when listening to whole (Study 1a) and thin-sliced (Study 1b) clips. Further linguistic analyses (Studies 2a–c) were inconclusive regarding the features that differed between the two groups. Future directions regarding the need to investigate the intersections between social identity priming and language behavior with a biracial lens are discussed.

Abstract = {This study used archival data to examine how White, Black, and biracial Black/White people respond to implicit attitude feedback suggesting that they harbor racial bias that does not align with their self-reported attitudes. The results suggested that people are generally defensive in response to feedback indicating that their implicit attitudes differ from their explicit attitudes. Among monoracial White and Black individuals, this effect was particularly strong when they learned that they were implicitly more pro-White than they indicated explicitly. By contrast, biracial Black/White individuals were defensive about large discrepancies in either direction (more pro-Black or more pro-White implicit attitudes). These results pinpoint one distinct difference between monoracial and biracial populations and pave the way for future research to further explore how monoracial majority, minority, and biracial populations compare in other types of attitudes and responses to personal feedback.

Abstract = {People give widely varying estimates for the amount of genetic overlap that exists between humans. While some laypeople believe that humans are highly genetically similar to one another, others believe that humans share very little genetic overlap. These studies examine how beliefs about genetic overlap affect neural and evaluative reactions to racially-ambiguous and biracial targets. In Study 1, we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted a stronger neural avoidance response to biracial compared to monoracial targets. In Study 2, we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted longer response times to classify biracial (vs. monoracial) faces into racial categories. In Study 3, we manipulated genetic overlap beliefs and found that participants in the low overlap condition explicitly rated biracial targets more negatively than those in the high overlap condition. Taken together, these data suggest that genetic overlap beliefs influence perceivers’ processing fluency and evaluation of biracial and racially-ambiguous individuals.

Abstract = {The present study examined the relationship of perceived parental closeness and parental ethnic identity on personal ethnic identity and colorblindness beliefs in 275 part-White biracial Americans (M age = 23.88). Respondents completed online measures of their personal ethnic identity (minority, White, and multiracial), perceived parental ethnic identity, parental closeness, and attitudes about the state of race relations and the need for social action in the United States. Using path modeling, results show that part-White biracial individuals perceive their ethnic identity to be strongly linked to their parental racial identities, especially when they had closer parental relationships. Moreover, stronger minority identity was linked to less colorblind attitudes, and greater White identity was linked to greater colorblind attitudes suggesting that patterns of identity may influence how biracial individuals view race-relations and the need for social action. Implications for biracial well-being and their understanding of prejudice and discrimination are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Monoracial (White, Black, Asian) and biracial (Black/White, Asian/White) children (N = 246, 3–8 years) had their racial identity primed. In a learning preferences task, participants determined the function of a novel object after watching adults (White, Black, and Asian) demonstrate its uses. In the social preferences task, participants saw pairs of children (White, Black, and Asian) and chose with whom they most wanted to socially affiliate. Biracial children showed flexibility in racial identification during learning and social tasks. However, minority‐primed biracial children were not more likely than monoracial minorities to socially affiliate with primed racial in‐group members, indicating their in‐group preferences are contextually based.

Abstract = {Background: Results from numerous studies suggest protective effects of the Mediterranean diet for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality. Evidence for an association with a decreased risk of cognitive decline is less consistent and studies are limited by a lack of diversity in their populations. Methods: We followed 2,326 older adults (38.2% black, 51.3% female, aged 70–79 at baseline) over 8 years in a prospective cohort study in the United States (Health, Aging and Body Composition study). To measure adherence to a Mediterranean diet, we calculated race-specific tertiles of the MedDiet score (range: 0–55) using baseline food frequency questionnaires. Cognitive decline was assessed using repeated Modified Mini Mental State Examination scores over the study. We used linear mixed models to assess the association between MedDiet score and trajectory of cognitive decline. Results: Among blacks, participants with high MedDiet scores had a significantly lower mean rate of decline on the Modified Mini Mental State Examination score compared with participants with lower MedDiet scores (middle and bottom tertiles). The mean difference in points per year was 0.22 (95% confidence interval: 0.05–0.39; p = .01) after adjustment for age, sex, education, body mass index, current smoking, physical activity, depression, diabetes, total energy intake, and socioeconomic status. No association between MedDiet scores and change in Modified Mini Mental State Examination score was seen among white participants (p = .14). Conclusions: Stronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet may reduce the rate of cognitive decline among black, but not white older adults. Further studies in diverse populations are needed to confirm this association and pinpoint mechanisms that may explain these results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

This exploratory study describes the level of interaction among mono-racial and bi/multiracial students on a large campus. Additionally, this study sought the input of bi/multiracial students on how colleges and universities can create a welcoming environment for this population. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are offered: 1. Colleges and universities must take definitive steps to provide supportive services and opportunities for bi/multiracial students including the creation of student organizations and activities for those who would benefit from these. 2. Recognition must be given to the fact that all biracial students do not hold the same attitudes and opinions related to their mixed race heritage, when making decisions about programming for biracial students. 3. Universities must provide opportunities to increase awareness and understanding of the biracial population among faculty, students, and staff through professional development workshops, trainings, college courses, and opportunities for open dialogues. 4. Steps must be taken to reduce the invisibility of multiracial people in the curriculum. 5. Universities must develop creative ways to increase the number of students who are exposed to courses on diversity and race relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Children with one White-identified and one Black-identified biological parent who were enrolled in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort participated in this study.

Relative to their biracially and Black-identified peers, White-identified biracial children were less likely to have frequent discussions about ethnic-racial heritage.

The study utilized data from parent and teacher reports on 293 US Black‐White biracial children enrolled in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study‐Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS‐K). Growth curve models suggested increasing trajectories of teacher‐reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors between kindergarten and fifth grade. Parents’ racial identification of children predicted child externalizing behavior trajectories such that teachers rated biracially identified children's externalizing behaviors lower relative to those of Black‐ and White‐identified children. Additionally, for White‐identified biracial children, the effect of family SES on internalizing behavior trajectories was especially pronounced. These findings suggest that in the USA, how parents racially identify their Black‐White biracial children early on has important implications for children's problem behaviors throughout the elementary school years.

Abstract = {The authors examined whether biracial (Black/White) individuals, who have access to multiple racial identities and experience with both Black and White faces, would be able to adopt the perceptual lens of a contextually salient racial identity. Biracial and monoracial perceivers wrote an essay about a time they connected with their mother’s or father’s ethnic identity before completing a face recognition task. The authors hypothesized that this essay prime would influence biracial perceivers’ racial identification and that their memory for Black, White, and racially ambiguous faces would reflect the motivational relevance of the target face to their salient racial identity. Results indicated that biracial individuals adopted different racial identifications to guide preferential memory relevant to their salient racial identity, exhibiting memory patterns comparable to monoracial individuals’ typical own-race bias. These findings suggest that ingroup memory effects depend on integration of bottom-up perceptual experience and top-down factors, such as the social relevance of faces.

Abstract = {Background and purpose: Some recent studies in older, largely white populations suggest that vitamin D, measured by 25‐hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], is important for cognition, but such results may be affected by reverse causation. Measuring 25(OH)D in late middle age before poor cognition affects behavior may provide clearer results. Methods: This was a prospective cohort analysis of 1652 participants (52% white, 48% black) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Brain MRI Study. 25(OH)D was measured from serum collected in 1993–1995. Cognition was measured by the delayed word recall test (DWRT), the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and the word fluency test (WFT). Dementia hospitalization was defined by ICD‐9 codes. Adjusted linear, logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used. Results: Mean age of participants was 62 years and 60% were female. Mean 25(OH)D was higher in whites than blacks (25.5 vs. 17.3 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Lower 25(OH)D was not associated with lower baseline scores or with greater DWRT, DSST or WFT decline over a median of 3 or 10 years of follow‐up (P > 0.05). Over a median of 16.6 years, there were 145 incident hospitalized dementia cases. Although not statistically significant, lower levels of 25(OH)D were suggestive of an association with increased dementia risk [hazard ratio for lowest versus highest race‐specific tertile: whites 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.69, 2.55); blacks 1.53 (95% confidence interval 0.84, 2.79)]. Conclusions: In contrast to prior studies performed in older white populations, our study of late middle age white and black participants did not find significant associations between lower levels of 25(OH)D with lower cognitive test scores at baseline, change in scores over time or dementia risk.

Abstract = {This study explores biracial identity development in the adolescent years through fusion autoethnography. Using an ecological model of biracial identity development, this study illustrates how family, peers, and school curricula validate and reject racial self-presentations. We pay specific attention to the different forms of silence (i.e. “crickets”) that teachers and peers deploy as tactics of rejection and how racially coded artifacts such as hip-hop culture and Black Liberation texts function as validations of racial self-presentations. Overall, this study helps researchers and practitioners to understand the fluidity of biracial and multiracial identity development as it relates to everyday school spaces and processes.

We found an intermediate biracial phenomenon in which some biracial youth initiate substance use at ages that fall between the initiation ages of their 2 corresponding monoracial groups. When controlling for the covariates, our findings show that White-Asian biracial youth begin smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol at earlier ages than Whites and engaging in all forms of substance use at earlier ages than Asian youth. Results indicate that White-American Indian youth start smoking cigarettes at earlier ages than all biracial and monoracial groups. Our findings underscore the need for future research to examine substance-use initiation and progression among biracial/ethnic youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: In the U.S., the incidence of lung cancer varies by race, with rates being highest among black men. There are marked differences in smoking behavior between blacks and whites, but little is known regarding how these differences contribute to the racial disparities in lung cancer. Purpose: To compare the lung cancer risk associated with smoking in 14,610 blacks and whites in the prospective cohort Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Methods: Smoking characteristics were ascertained at baseline and three follow-up visits in 1990–1992, 1993–1995, and 1996–1998 (response rates were 93%, 86%, and 80%, respectively), as well as from annual telephone interviews. Data were analyzed in the fall of 2012. Multivariable-adjusted proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% CIs for lung cancer. Results: Over 20 years of follow-up (1987–2006), 470 incident cases of lung cancer occurred. Lung cancer incident rates were highest in black men and lowest in black women. However, there was no evidence to support racial differences in the associations of smoking status, intensity, or age at initiation with lung cancer risk (all pinteraction ≥ 0.25). The hazard ratio for those who started smoking at age ≤12 versus >22 years was 3.03 (95% CI = 1.62, 5.67). Prolonged smoking cessation (≥10 years) was associated with a decrease in lung cancer risk, with equivalent benefits in whites and blacks, 84% and 74%, respectively (pinteraction = 0.25). Conclusions: Smoking confers similar lung cancer risk in blacks and whites. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: The present study investigates developmental trajectories of alcohol use from early adolescence to adulthood by age and race/ethnicity among White, Black, Black-American Indian, Black-Hispanic, and Black-White individuals and associated sociodemograhphic correlates. Method: We used a subsample of nationally representative data obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The analytic sample consisted of 15,278 individuals in Wave 1 (ages 11 to 21 years). The sample consists of adolescents who were in Grades 7–12 at wave one and who were followed across four waves of data collection into adulthood. Respondents could report more than one race/ethnicity. Results: We find distinct alcohol trajectories among monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks with all groups showing a cross-over or catch-up effect. Black-White adults demonstrated a cross-over effect by surpassing the alcohol drinking rates of Whites in adulthood, Black-American Indians showed a within-group catch-up effect by surpassing the alcohol drinking rates of monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks in adulthood, and monoracial Blacks were most likely to be non-drinkers in adulthood. We also show gender, socioeconomic status, and household structure differences in impact on alcohol use among monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks. Conclusions: Significant heterogeneity is observed regarding alcohol trajectories between monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Racial essentialism refers to the widely held belief that race is a biological, stable, and natural category. Although research finds very little evidence that race has biological underpinnings, racial essentialist beliefs persist and are linked to negative outgroup consequences. This study initially demonstrates that label and visual ambiguity concurrently inform racial categorization. It then tests whether exposure to racially ambiguous targets (a) challenges essentialism when ambiguous targets are labeled with biracial categories and (b) reinforces essentialism when ambiguous targets identify with monoracial categories. The results showed that White perceivers (N = 84) who were exposed to racially ambiguous, biracially labeled targets showed reductions in their essentialist thinking about race, whereas perceivers who were exposed to racially ambiguous, monoracially labeled targets showed increases in their essentialist beliefs.

The present paper begins to establish the role of individual differences and social context in hypodescent, the process of assigning multiracials the status of their relatively disadvantaged parent group. Specifically, in two experiments, we found that individual differences in social dominance orientation—a preference for group-based hierarchy and inequality—interacts with perceptions of socioeconomic threat to influence the use of hypodescent in categorizing half-Black, half-White biracial targets.

Abstract = {In two studies we investigate how the fluid identities of biracial individuals interact with contextual factors to shape behavior in interracial settings. In Study 1, biracial Black/White participants (n = 22) were primed with either their Black or White identity before having a race-related discussion with a Black confederate. Study 2 (n = 34) assessed the influence of our prime on racial self-identification and examined interactions with a White confederate. Self-reports and nonverbal behavior indicated that when the primed racial ingroup matched that of an interaction partner, biracial participants behaved much like participants in same-race interactions in previous studies, exhibiting lower levels of anxiety. Priming the opposite racial identity, however, led to greater signs of anxiety, mimicking past interracial interaction findings. These results extend previous findings regarding the influence of contextual factors on racial identification for biracial individuals, and are the first to demonstrate the implications of these effects for behavioral tendencies.

Abstract = {This study estimates the prevalence of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use in a nationally representative sample of monoracial/ethnic and biracial/ethnic youth and young adults. The authors consider 16 racial/ethnic categories and used four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The analysis sample consists of 20,745 individuals in Wave 1. The primary statistical methodology used in the present study is logistic regression with sample weights. Findings suggest that participants who self-report two races/ethnicities have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates. For example, Black-American Indians reported cigarette smoking rates that were significantly lower than rates reported by American Indians but significantly higher than rates reported by Blacks. Groups with the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking at Wave 1 were American Indian, White-American Indian, White, and Multiracial (people reporting three or more races/ethnicities). Groups with the highest prevalence of alcohol drinking at Wave 1 were White-American Indian, Multiracial, Hispanic, White, and White-Hispanic. Groups with the highest prevalence of marijuana smoking at Wave 1 were Black-Asian and American Indian. The authors found an interaction effect between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Lower-class SES status may serve as a risk factor for biracial/ethnic adolescents while upper-class SES may serve as a protective factor for these youth. In general, biracial/ethnic individuals have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates.

Abstract = {Racial identification is a complex and dynamic process for multiracial individuals, who as members of multiple racial groups have been shown to self-identify or be identified by others differently, depending on the social context. For biracial individuals who have white and minority ancestry, such identity shifting (e.g., from minority to white, or vice versa) may be a way to cope with the threats to their racial identity that can be signaled by the presence or absence of whites and/or minorities in their social environment. We examine whether stigma consciousness (Pinel in J Pers Soc Psychol 76(1):114–128, 1999; i.e., the chronic awareness of the stereotyping and prejudice that minorities face) interacts with the sociocultural context to predict social identity threat, belonging, and racial identification. Using experience sampling methodology, minority/white biracial individuals (27 Asian/white, 22 black/white, and 26 Latino/white) reported the racial composition of their environment, social identity threat for their component racial identities, overall feelings of belonging, and racial identification over a 1-week period. Results suggest that stigma consciousness predicts the extent to which biracial people identify with their white background and experience belonging in different racial contexts. We discuss racial identity shifting in response to context-based threats as a protective strategy for biracial people, and identity where participants’ sociocultural contexts and experiences with racial identity and threat differ as a result of their minority racial group or ascribed race.

A qualitative thematic analysis was used to identify racial socialization messages mothers used and emergent racial socialization approaches. Mothers of biracial youth engaged in the full range of racial socialization discussed in the literature, including cultural, minority, self-development, egalitarian, and silent racial socialization. These messages varied by the biracial heritage of the youth, such that mothers of biracial youth with Black heritage were more likely to provide self-development racial socialization messages, whereas mothers of biracial youth without Black heritage were more likely to provide silent racial socialization. On the basis of the array of racial socialization messages mothers delivered, we identified three emergent approaches: promotive, protective, and passive racial socialization.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 24(4) of Psychological Science (see record [rid]2013-13680-028[/rid]). In the original article, the authors mistakenly cited the wrong database from which they took the Black and White faces they used to make the biracial targets. The correct source is The Center for Vital Longevity Face Database (Minear & Park, 2004). Researchers can request access to the database at https://pal.utdallas.edu/facedb/request/index. All faces were taken from the 18- to 29-year-old neutralexpression subset.] In-group biases are a ubiquitous feature of human social life. One explanation offered for these biases is that they arise from resource competition between groups. In this view, hostility toward the out-group is predicted to occur when people’s access to a resource is constrained or when they seek to justify an existing resource advantage. In the studies reported here, this logic was extended to test a novel prediction about in-group boundary formation—specifically, whether resource scarcity decreases the inclusiveness of racial in-groups. Two experiments were conducted in which people were primed with cues to scarcity or abundance and were then asked to categorize biracial faces as being Black or White. It was predicted that willingness to include racially ambiguous individuals as part of their racial in-group would be lower in participants primed with scarcity cues than in participants primed with abundance cues. In Study 1, as predicted, participants in the scarcity condition categorized more faces as Black than did those in the abundance condition. In Study 2, we sought to replicate the results from Study 1 using a different priming procedure. A control group was also included that saw neither a scarcity nor an abundance prime, to determine whether the results from Study 1 were driven by changes in perceptions of resource scarcity, resource abundance, or both. Participants primed with cues to scarcity categorized more biracial faces as Black compared with participants primed with neutral cues and those primed with cues to abundance. Categorization performance did not differ significantly between the control and abundance conditions. In two experiments, it was found that times of economic hardship may limit the inclusiveness of people’s racial in-groups: Cues to scarcity led people to categorize fewer biracial individuals as belonging to their in-group, whereas cues to abundance had no such effect. These findings extend the existing literature on in-group biases and out-group prejudice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Findings indicated that family ethnic socialization was positively related to participants' ethnic identity exploration and resolution, but not ethnic identity affirmation. Furthermore, ethnic identity resolution and affirmation were associated with higher self-acceptance and self-esteem, and lower depressive symptoms. Importantly, university ethnic composition moderated the association between ethnic identity resolution and anxiety, such that resolution promoted adjustment in contexts that were relatively more ethnically diverse. University ethnic composition also moderated the association between ethnic identity affirmation and both self-esteem and self-acceptance, such that affirmation was associated with better adjustment but only in schools that were less ethnically diverse.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine whether observed differences in dementia rates between black and white older people living in the community could be explained by measures of socioeconomic status (income, financial adequacy, education, and literacy) and health related factors. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: General community from two clinic sites in the United States (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee). Participants: 2457 older people (mean age 73.6 years; 1019 (41.5%) black; 1233 (50.2%) women), dementia-free at baseline, in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. Main outcome measure: Dementia was determined over 12 years (ending January 2011) by prescribed dementia drugs, hospital records, and decline in global cognitive scores. The influence of socioeconomic status and health related factors on dementia rates was examined in a series of Cox proportional hazard models in which these variables were added sequentially in covariate blocks. Results: Over follow-up, 449 (18.3%) participants developed dementia. Black participants were more likely than white participants to develop dementia (211 (20.7%) v 238 (16.6%), P < 0.001; unadjusted hazard ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.74). The hazard ratio lessened somewhat after adjustment for demographics, apolipoprotein E e4, comorbidities, and lifestyle factors (1.37, 1.12 to 1.67) but was greatly reduced and no longer statistically significant when socioeconomic status was added (1.09, 0.87 to 1.37). Conclusion: These findings suggest that differences in the burden of risk factors, especially socioeconomic status, may contribute to the higher rates of dementia seen among black compared with white older people. Strategies aimed at reducing these disparities may favorably affect the incidence of dementia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We know that early experience plays a crucial role in the development of face processing, but we know little about how infants learn to distinguish faces from different races, especially for non-Caucasian populations. Moreover, it is unknown whether differential processing of different race faces observed in typically studied monoracial infants extends to biracial infants as well. Thus, we investigated 3-month-old Caucasian, Asian and biracial (Caucasian-Asian) infants’ ability to distinguish Caucasian and Asian faces. Infants completed two within-subject, infant-controlled habituation sequences and test trials as an eye tracker recorded looking times and scanning patterns. Examination of individual differences revealed significant positive correlations between own-race novelty preference and scanning frequency between eye and mouth regions of own-race habituation stimuli for Caucasian and Asian infants, suggesting that facility in own-race face discrimination stems from active inspection of internal facial features in these groups. Biracial infants, however, showed the opposite effect: An ‘own-race’ novelty preference was associated with reduced scanning between eye and mouth regions of ‘own-race’ habituation stimuli, suggesting that biracial infants use a distinct approach to processing frequently encountered faces. Future directions for investigating face processing development in biracial populations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {When the words ‘identity’ or ‘community’ are evoked, a homogenizing process forms for the sake of community coherence. This article is based upon interviews with nine bisexual and mixed race participants about their conceptualization of identity-based communities. All participants expressed discontent with the ‘established’ gay and lesbian community for being monolithically White in racial composition and also biphobic. More than one half of the participants had been involved in queer Asian American women’s organizations, within which they felt the least conflict and the most inclusion. The ideals of identity-based organizations have only sporadically manifested themselves for the bisexual-biracial women who are otherwise marginalized, silenced or excluded. Because their diverse needs and identities are not represented within these organizations, many of the participants felt they gave more than they received. Finding that communities based upon narrow identity clusters were not ideal, the participants created diverse communities based upon their expanded interests and identities. These bisexual-biracial women have revolutionized their personal concepts of community as they integrated the ideals of identity politics yet moved to include individuals who share similar progressive politics, responsibility and acceptance.

Abstract = {What factors determine whether mixed-race individuals claim a biracial identity or a monoracial identity? Two studies examine how two status-related factors—race and social class—influence identity choice. While a majority of mixed-race participants identified as biracial in both studies, those who were members of groups with higher status in American society were more likely than those who were members of groups with lower status to claim a biracial identity. Specifically, (a) Asian/White individuals were more likely than Black/White or Latino/White individuals to identify as biracial and (b) mixed-race people from middle-class backgrounds were more likely than those from working-class backgrounds to identify as biracial. These results suggest that claiming a biracial identity is a choice that is more available to those with higher status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Obama and the biracial factor: The battle for a new American majority edited by Andrew J. Jolivette (2012). This book a collection of essays that critically explore the role of US President Barack Obama’s biracial background not only in his 2008 election and first term in office but also in the context of an increasingly multiracial USA. This volume is part of a multidisciplinary body of scholarship on 'mixed race' or multiraciality that has grown exponentially in the USA and the UK over the past two decades. However, it also departs from this scholarship’s tendency to focus exclusively on the topics of identity formation and racial classification on government forms. Instead, utilizing the timely case of President Obama -'the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas'- the book examines what Jolivette terms ‘mixed race hegemony’, the assertion that 'biracial and multiracial individuals and families will lead to the end of a race-conscious and racially-discriminatory society in the United States'. Overall, many race scholars, likely, will find Jolivette’s concept of ‘mixed race hegemony’ a more contextualized alternative to broader terms like ‘colour-blindness’ in the critical examinations of multiraciality.

Abstract = {The term multiracial is complex. Recent research has adopted a multidimensional view initially proposed by Rockquemore and colleagues (2002, 2009) for examining racial identity among Black/White biracial people. This approach has acknowledged the social construction of race and broadened the range of racial identity options beyond the two “traditional” options of being “Black” or “biracial.” This study was designed to further assess this framework by examining a more diverse multiracial sample from Canada and the U.S. (N = 122). Both the Black/White biracials (n = 38) and Asian/White biracials (n = 40) showed great variability in their selection of Rockquemore's multiracial identity categories, but the pattern of responses differed across the two groups. In addition to revealing different patterns of identity selection between Asian/White and Black/White biracial persons, findings demonstrated the importance of identity validation by others and its relation to conceptions of the self. Having a multiracial identity that is validated by others (as opposed to invalidated or contextually dependent identities) was associated with higher levels of identity integration and self-concept clarity. Theoretical implications for extending a multidimensional model to other biracial groups are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

This choice, however, is available to whites only; black Americans have less choice because their ascribed race trumps any ethnic status.

Furthermore, can race, like ethnicity, be symbolic? I find that these biracial respondents frequently draw on white ethnic and racial symbols, not to identify as white or with a particular white ethnic group, but rather to highlight their white ancestries in order to identify as 'biracial'.

Abstract = {Individuals who qualify equally for membership in two racial groups provide a rare window into social categorization and perception. In 5 experiments, we tested the extent to which a rule of hypodescent, whereby biracial individuals are assigned the status of their socially subordinate parent group, would govern perceptions of Asian–White and Black–White targets. In Experiment 1, in spite of posing explicit questions concerning Asian–White and Black–White targets, hypodescent was observed in both cases and more strongly in Black–White social categorization. Experiments 2A and 2B used a speeded response task and again revealed evidence of hypodescent in both cases, as well as a stronger effect in the Black–White target condition. In Experiments 3A and 3B, social perception was studied with a face-morphing task. Participants required a face to be lower in proportion minority to be perceived as minority than in proportion White to be perceived as White. Again, the threshold for being perceived as White was higher for Black–White than for Asian–White targets. An independent categorization task in Experiment 3B further confirmed the rule of hypodescent and variation in it that reflected the current racial hierarchy in the United States. These results documenting biases in the social categorization and perception of biracials have implications for resistance to change in the American racial hierarchy.

Abstract = {The present study examined the causal role of amount of Black ancestry in targets' perceived fit with Black prototypes and perceivers' categorization of biracial targets. Greater Black ancestry increased the likelihood that perceivers categorized biracial targets as Black and perceived targets as fitting Black prototypes (e.g., experiencing racial discrimination, possessing stereotypic traits). These results persisted, controlling for perceptions of phenotype that stem from ancestry information. Perceivers' beliefs about how society would categorize the biracial targets predicted perceptions of discrimination, whereas perceivers' beliefs about the targets' self-categorization predicted trait perceptions. The results of this study support the Black ancestry prototype model of affirmative action, which reveals the downstream consequences of Black ancestry for the distribution of minority resources (e.g., affirmative action) to biracial targets.

Extending research on "identity work" (Snow and Anderson 1987), we explore the strategies biracial people use to conceal (i.e., pass), cover, and/or accent aspects of their racial ancestries, and the individual and structural-level factors that limit the accessibility and/or effectiveness of some strategies. We further find that how these biracial respondents identify is often contextual—most identify as biracial, but in some contexts, they pass as monoracial. Scholars argue that passing may be a relic of the past, yet we find that passing still occurs today. Most notably, we find a striking reverse pattern of passing today—while passing during the Jim Crow era involved passing as white, these respondents more often report passing as black today. Motivations for identity work are explored, with an emphasis on passing as black. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

In this study, we examine how the racial makeup of the student body affects self-identified biracial adolescents' school attachment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that the proportions of white or black students in school significantly affect the school attachment of Hispanic/black, Asian/black, and American Indian/black biracial adolescents, but school racial composition in general has little influence on biracial adolescents with a partial-white identification (i.e., black/white, Hispanic/white, Asian/white, and American Indian/white). Our analyses also show that on average, students of most biracial groups display lower school attachment than their corresponding monoracial groups, but the differences from the monoracial groups with the lower school attachment are generally small. We discuss the implications of our findings for biracial adolescents' perceived racial boundaries and contemporary American race relations.

Abstract = {In the USA, African-American children are overrepresented in the child welfare system. However, little is known about the child welfare system experiences of biracial children, who are predominately both White and African-American. To better understand this population, data from public child welfare in a US county were used to examine biracial children in the child welfare system. Results showed significant racial differences between children in the child welfare system. Despite the common belief that biracial children will have experiences similar to African-American children, the child welfare system seems to view them differently. Biracial children are more likely to be referred, rated as high risk and investigated compared with White or African-American children. Their mothers were younger, and were more often assessed as having physical, intellectual or emotional problems. These caregivers were also considered to have lower parenting skills and knowledge compared with White or African-American caregivers. Although the disproportionate representation of African-American children in the system has been well documented, this study provides evidence that biracial children are also overrepresented. Despite the fact that this is a rapidly growing population in the USA, there is little research available about biracial children and their families.

Abstract = {Transracial adoption [TRA], particularly the adoption of black children by white parents, has been a controversial issue in the United States for more than half a century. Much of the criticism surrounding transracial adoption has dealt with concerns that black children raised in white homes will fail to develop a positive black identity. Such critiques are often based on assumptions about the identity of black children raised by their biological parents, yet studies of transracial adoption rarely address identity development struggles experienced by black children raised in black homes. Moreover, while the race of parents in relation to children is at the center of the transracial adoption debate, TRA studies rarely delve into socialization practices of biracial families headed by one white and one black parent. This study addresses a void in the literature by examining the experiences of young black adults whose parents may or may not be of the same race. The impact of varying racialized family structures on black identity development is examined by comparing the experiences of young black adults raised in families with two black parents (monoracial), one white and one black parent (biracial), and two white parents (transracial). Drawing from 32 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with middle-class young black adults between the ages of 18 and 30 years old, findings indicate that all informants, regardless of racialized family structure, approach racial identity development similarly by de-emphasizing the ascribed status of race in favor of achieved statuses as part of the identity construction process.

Abstract = {Objectives: We describe temporal trends in stroke incidence stratified by age from our population-based stroke epidemiology study. We hypothesized that stroke incidence in younger adults (age 20–54) increased over time, most notably between 1999 and 2005. Methods: The Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region includes an estimated population of 1.3 million. Strokes were ascertained in the population between July 1, 1993, and June 30, 1994, and in calendar years 1999 and 2005. Age-, race-, and gender-specific incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution. We tested for differences in age trends over time using a mixed-model approach, with appropriate link functions. Results: The mean age at stroke significantly decreased from 71.2 years in 1993/1994 to 69.2 years in 2005 (p < 0.0001). The proportion of all strokes under age 55 increased from 12.9% in 1993/1994 to 18.6% in 2005. Regression modeling showed a significant change over time (p = 0.002), characterized as a shift to younger strokes in 2005 compared with earlier study periods. Stroke incidence rates in those 20–54 years of age were significantly increased in both black and white patients in 2005 compared to earlier periods. Conclusions: We found trends toward increasing stroke incidence at younger ages. This is of great public health significance because strokes in younger patients carry the potential for greater lifetime burden of disability and because some potential contributors identified for this trend are modifiable.

Seventy-four black/white biracial individuals were recruited using a modified snowball sampling technique and completed online survey measures related to self-identification, ethnic identity, self-esteem, and depression. Ethnic identity was positively related to self-esteem and negatively to depression. Results also revealed that participants who either identified as biracial all the time (border identity) or sometimes (protean identity) had higher self-esteem and lower levels of depression than those who did not acknowledge their biracial identity (singular and transcendent identity). This study suggests the incorporation of both component races, rather than choosing one or denying both races as part of the identity, is associated with better psychosocial adjustment.

Abstract = {Background: Few population-based studies have examined the behavioral and psychosocial predictors of long-term weight-loss maintenance. Purpose: The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of weight-loss maintenance in a biracial cohort of younger adults. Methods: This study examined a population-based sample of overweight/obese African-American and white men and women who had ≥5% weight loss between 1995 and 2000. Subsequent changes in weight, physical activity, and behavioral and psychosocial factors were examined between 2000 and 2005. Analyses were conducted in 2008–2009. Results: Among the 1869 overweight/obese individuals without major disease in 1995, a total of 536 (29%) lost ≥5% between 1995 and 2000. Among those who lost weight, 34% (n=180) maintained at least 75% of their weight loss between 2000 and 2005, whereas 66% subsequently regained. Higher odds of successful weight-loss maintenance were related to African-American race (OR=1.7, p=0.03); smoking (OR=3.4, p=0.0001); history of diabetes (OR=2.2, p=0.04); increases in moderate physical activity between 2000 and 2005 (OR=1.4, p=0.005); increases in emotional support over the same period (OR=1.6, p=0.01); and less sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption in 2005 (OR=0.8, p=0.006). Conclusions: One third of overweight men and women who lost weight were able to maintain 75% or more of their weight loss over 5 years. Interventions to promote weight-loss maintenance may benefit from targeting increased physical activity and emotional support and decreased sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption.

Abstract = {Several scholars claim that group cohesion among black Americans is necessary for black advancement. Our research examines the extent to which group cohesion is possible given the increasing diversity of Black America, particularly with regard to race and class. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 33 middle-class blacks and 40 black-white biracials, we explore (1) the similarities and differences in the experiences of both groups, (2) their encounters with marginalization, (3) how they negotiate perceived marginalization, and (4) the extent to which all of the above are shaped by socially constructed ideas of blackness. We find that narrow notions of "authentic" blackness challenge group cohesion and threaten to splinter the black community along class and ethnic/racial lines. However, we find evidence of greater tolerance for the community’s racial diversity than its class diversity. Nevertheless, the data presented here suggest that the increasing heterogeneity of Black America poses significant challenges to group cohesion.

Abstract = {Objective: There are limited epidemiological data about headache in urban elderly persons in the United States, especially those from minority backgrounds. This article examines the prevalence of headache and associated psychosocial factors in a biracial sample of older adults in New York City. Methods. Data from a population-based sample consisting of 214 Caucasians and 859 Blacks aged 55 and over (mean age: 68 years) were analyzed using an adaptation of George's Social Antecedent Model of Psychopathology. The model consisted of 15 independent variables, one interactive variable, and a dependent variable that dichotomized headaches that bothered respondents into "none or little of the time" versus "some, a good part, or most of the time" in the past few weeks. Results: Controlling for design effects, 17.8% of the sample met headache criteria. For the entire sample, logistic regression analysis indicated that headache was significantly associated with anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, religiosity, and a smaller proportion of confidantes. When examined separately, headache among blacks was significantly associated with anxiety symptoms, larger social networks, and greater financial strain. Among Caucasians, headache was associated with anxiety symptoms, smaller social networks, religiosity, physical illness, and higher daily functioning. Conclusions • The study confirms earlier findings that anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with headache in older adults. The results also identify other psychosocial factors that may differ by race. These findings have important implications with respect to the etiology and management of headache in older adults.

Abstract = {Background: White matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), cerebral infarcts, and total brain volume (TBV) are associated with cognitive function, but few studies have examined these associations in the general population or whether they differ by race. Objective: To examine the association of WMHV, cerebral infarcts, and TBV with global cognition and cognition in 5 separate domains in a biracial population sample. Setting: A biracial community population of Chicago, Illinois. Design: Cross-sectional population study. Participants: The study population comprised 575 participants from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP). Main Outcome Measures: Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of WMHV, TBV, and cerebral infarcts and detailed neuropsychological testing assessments of global cognition and 5 cognitive domains. Results: Overall and among those without dementia, cognition was inversely associated with WMHV and number of infarcts but was positively associated with TBV. When all 3 measures were simultaneously added to the model, the association of global cognition with WMHV and TBV remained significant and unchanged but was no longer significant with infarcts. Among subjects without dementia, all 3 MRI measures were associated with performance in multiple cognitive domains, specifically perceptual speed. However, among subjects with dementia, only TBV was associated with cognition and performance in multiple cognitive systems. Race did not significantly modify any of these associations. Conclusions: In this biracial general population sample, the associations of MRI measures with cognition differed according to clinical status of subjects (stronger among subjects without dementia) and were not modified by race. These associations did not affect all cognitive domains equally but were more consistent with impairments in perceptual speed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Historically, race has been constructed within the American psyche as a dichotomous variable. Language has developed to mirror this reality, which ultimately aids in its perpetuation. Presently, there remain cultural and linguistic disconnects between the phenomenological experience of the biracial individual and the expectations of the dualistic society within which they reside. On the individual level, there are implications for psychosocial development (Hall, 2001; Root, 1995). More broadly speaking, what will develop from the resolution of this dilemma is a new paradigm impacting how the citizens of this country view race and racial identity. This chapter explores the impact that the sociohistorical constructions of race and language have on the lives of biracial individuals. The author, who is biracial, will blend sociohistorical conceptions of race and linguistic philosophy with personal narrative components and conclude with implications for multiracial identity development.

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Does this recession make me look Black? The effect of resource scarcity on the categorization of biracial faces" by Christopher D. Rodeheffer, Sarah E. Hill and Charles G. Lord (Psychological Science, 2012[Dec], Vol 23[12], 1476-1478). In the original article, the authors mistakenly cited the wrong database from which they took the Black and White faces they used to make the biracial targets. The correct source is The Center for Vital Longevity Face Database (Minear & Park, 2004). Researchers can request access to the database at https://pal.utdallas.edu/facedb/request/index. All faces were taken from the 18- to 29-year-old neutralexpression subset. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-34178-008[/rid]). In-group biases are a ubiquitous feature of human social life. One explanation offered for these biases is that they arise from resource competition between groups. In this view, hostility toward the out-group is predicted to occur when people’s access to a resource is constrained or when they seek to justify an existing resource advantage. In the studies reported here, this logic was extended to test a novel prediction about in-group boundary formation—specifically, whether resource scarcity decreases the inclusiveness of racial in-groups. Two experiments were conducted in which people were primed with cues to scarcity or abundance and were then asked to categorize biracial faces as being Black or White. It was predicted that willingness to include racially ambiguous individuals as part of their racial in-group would be lower in participants primed with scarcity cues than in participants primed with abundance cues. In Study 1, as predicted, participants in the scarcity condition categorized more faces as Black than did those in the abundance condition. In Study 2, we sought to replicate the results from Study 1 using a different priming procedure. A control group was also included that saw neither a scarcity nor an abundance prime, to determine whether the results from Study 1 were driven by changes in perceptions of resource scarcity, resource abundance, or both. Participants primed with cues to scarcity categorized more biracial faces as Black compared with participants primed with neutral cues and those primed with cues to abundance. Categorization performance did not differ significantly between the control and abundance conditions. In two experiments, it was found that times of economic hardship may limit the inclusiveness of people’s racial in-groups: Cues to scarcity led people to categorize fewer biracial individuals as belonging to their in-group, whereas cues to abundance had no such effect. These findings extend the existing literature on in-group biases and out-group prejudice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {People tend to view members of their own political group more positively than members of a competing political group. In this article, we demonstrate that political partisanship influences people’s visual representations of a biracial political candidate’s skin tone. In three studies, participants rated the representativeness of photographs of a hypothetical (Study 1) or real (Barack Obama; Studies 2 and 3) biracial political candidate. Unbeknownst to participants, some of the photographs had been altered to make the candidate’s skin tone either lighter or darker than it was in the original photograph. Participants whose partisanship matched that of the candidate they were evaluating consistently rated the lightened photographs as more representative of the candidate than the darkened photographs, whereas participants whose partisanship did not match that of the candidate showed the opposite pattern. For evaluations of Barack Obama, the extent to which people rated lightened photographs as representative of him was positively correlated with their stated voting intentions and reported voting behavior in the 2008 Presidential election. This effect persisted when controlling for political ideology and racial attitudes. These results suggest that people’s visual representations of others are related to their own preexisting beliefs and to the decisions they make in a consequential context.

Abstract = {Are biracial people perceived more negatively than their monoracial counterparts? Across two studies, we compared ratings of warmth, competence, and minority scholarship worthiness for biracial (Study 1: Black/White, Study 2: Asian/White), White, and minority (Study 1: Black, Study 2: Asian) college applicants. Findings suggest that both biracial applicants were perceived as colder and sometimes less competent than both White and corresponding minority applicants. Moreover, biracial people were also perceived as less qualified for minority scholarships than other racial minorities, which is partially explained by penalties to warmth and competence. Study 3 shows that disclosing one’s biracial identity makes biracial people vulnerable to negative feedback. Taken together, these studies suggest that biracial people who disclose their biracial identity experience bias from perceivers and may be more vulnerable to that bias because of the personal nature of racial disclosure. Findings are discussed considering the stereotype content model (Cuddy, Fiske, & Glick, 2007), cultural stereotypes about biracial people (Jackman, Wagner, & Johnson, 2001), and the costs of disclosing devalued identities.

Abstract = {Objectives: There continues to be a debate about the long-term prognosis of psychiatric treatment of depression in later life. There have been no long-term naturalistic studies of psychiatric outpatient treatment of older adults in the United States. This study examines outcome and predictors of various levels of depression among a biracial sample of geropsychiatric outpatients in Brooklyn, NY. Methods: We conducted a naturalistic study (median: 33 months) of 143 persons aged 55 and over with diagnoses of depression drawn from 15 psychiatry outpatient clinics and 2 geriatric day programs. Their mean age was 68 years, 87% were female, and 43% were white and 57% were black, among whom 37% were African Caribbeans. Using George's Social Antecedent Model of Depression, we examined the impact of 15 predictor variables on two outcome measures: presence of any either subclinical or clinical depression (CES-D score ≥8) and presence of clinical depression (CES-D score ≥ 16). Results: On follow-up, 84% and 90% of subclinically and clinically depressed persons at baseline, respectively, were depressed (CES-D ≥ 8); 62% of those in remission at baseline were depressed. In logistic regression, 3 variables were significant predictors of any level of depression on follow-up: baseline depression, baseline anxiety, greater increase in anxiety symptoms during the follow-up period. These 3 variables along with financial strain were significant predictors of clinical depression on follow-up. There were no inter- or intra-racial differences in outcome. Conclusions: The bleak outcome findings among older psychiatric outpatients in Brooklyn were consistent with unfavorable results reported in European studies. Because there were only a few predictors of outcome, strategies that target high risk persons—e.g., such as those with subclinical depression, anxiety, or in more economic distress—may prevent transition to severe and persistent depressive states.

Strong empirical support exists for the use of behavioral activation approaches for MDD and for cognitive-behavioral approaches for SAD, but these strategies may also work well when used concurrently to treat comorbid MDD and SAD. This study presents a biracial client seeking treatment for chronic MDD maintained in part by his symptoms associated with SAD, which also impacted service utilization in relation to diabetes. Behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD) and cognitive-behavioral therapy for SAD were used integratively to simultaneously address MDD and SAD symptoms. Following nine sessions of treatment, the patient experienced dramatic changes in both anxiety and depression symptoms across all measures and successfully sought out and received medical treatment for his health problems.

This study aimed to (1) examine the associations between self-neglect severity and psychological, health, and social factors (2) examine the racial/ethnic differences in these associations. Methods: We conducted a biracial population-based study in a geographically defined community in Chicago: Chicago Health Aging Project. We identified 1094 persons who had been identified by social services agency as suspected elder self-neglect from 1993 to 2005. Self-neglect severity was assessed on a 0-45 scale. The psychological, health, and social factors were assessed using Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CESD), poor mental health, health status, unhealthy days, poor physical health, days away from usual activities, social network, and social engagement. Linear regression was used to assess associations between self-neglect and psychological, health, and social factors. Interaction terms (Self-neglect × Race) were used to assess the black (non-Hispanic black) and white (non-Hispanic white) differences in these associations. Results: There were significant associations between self-neglect severity with health and social factors. After adjusting for confounders, greater self-neglect severity was associated with lower health status (PE = 0.001, p = 0.002), higher unhealthy days (PE = 0.139, p < 0.001), poor physical health (PE = 0.141, p < 0.001), and more days away from usual activities (PE = 0.120, p = 0.030). Interaction term (Self-Neglect × Race) indicates black compared with white older adults, had more days away from usual activities (PE = 0.321, p = 0.045) and lower social engagement (PE = -0.04, p = 0.003). Conclusion: Greater self-neglect severity is associated with lower levels of health and social wellbeing. These associations may be stronger for black than white older adults.

Abstract = {Background: This study emphasizes the importance of studying the emotional, motivational, and cognitive characteristics accompanying and the potential hemodynamic mechanisms underlying cardiovascular reactivity to and recovery from interpersonal conflict. Purpose: The relation of dispositional hostility to cardiovascular reactivity during a frustrating anagram task and post-task recovery was investigated. Methods: The sample was composed of 99 healthy participants (age, 18–30 years; 53% women; 51% Caucasian; 49% African American)—half randomly assigned to a harassment condition. High and low hostility groups were created by a median split specific to sex and race subgroup score distributions on the Cook–Medley Hostility Scale. It was hypothesized that hostility would interact with harassment such that harassed, high hostile individuals would display the greatest cardiovascular and emotional reactivity and slowest recovery of the four groups. Participants completed a 10-min baseline, a 6-min anagram task, and a 5-min recovery period with blood pressure, heart rate, pre-ejection period, stroke index, cardiac index, and total peripheral resistance index measured. Results: Harassed participants displayed significantly greater cardiovascular responses and lower positive affect to the task and slower systolic blood pressure (SBP) recovery than did nonharassed participants. The high hostile group, irrespective of harassment, showed blunted cardiovascular responses during the task and delayed SBP recovery than the low hostile group. Conclusion: Although the predicted interaction between hostility and harassment was not supported in the context of cardiovascular responses, such an interaction was observed in the context of blame attributions, whereby harassed hostile participants were found to blame others for their task performance than the other subgroups.

Abstract = {We examined the relation of level of cognition to survival in a biracial community population of more than 10,000 older persons. At baseline, participants completed 4 cognitive tests from which a composite global cognitive measure was derived. During up to 14 years of follow-up (mean = 6.9 years), 4201 people died (41.6%). Higher level of cognitive function was associated with increased survival even after controlling for health related and lifestyle variables. The association did not differ between African Americans and whites; it was stronger in older than younger persons; and it was especially pronounced for perceptual speed. The results underscore the importance of cognition to survival in old age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objectives: There are a paucity of long-term studies from the United States concerning predictors of outcome among depressed older community adults. This article examines predictors of depression in a biracial sample of older persons in Brooklyn, NY. Methods: The authors conducted a naturalistic study of 110 persons aged 55 years and older living in randomly selected block groups who had a Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) score of ≥8 at baseline. Persons were reassessed on an average of 3 years later. Their mean age was 69 years, 52% were women, and 35% were whites, and 65% were blacks, among whom 71% were African Caribbeans. Using George’s Social Antecedent Model of Depression, the authors examined the impact of 13 predictor variables on two outcome measures: presence of either subsyndromal or syndromal depression (CES-D score ≥8) and presence of syndromal depression (CES-D score ≥16). To control for design effects, the authors used SUDAAN for the data analysis. Results: On follow-up, 82% and 88% of subsyndromally and syndromally depressed persons at baseline, respectively, were depressed (CES-D ≥8). In logistic regression, baseline depressive symptoms, baseline anxiety symptoms, greater increase in anxiety symptoms during the follow-up period, and higher locus of control were predictors of any level of depression. These four variables along with greater paranoid ideation and/or psychoses and more reliable social contacts were significant predictors of syndromal depression on follow-up. There were no inter- or intraracial differences in outcome. Conclusion: Depressed community elders in Brooklyn have highly unfavorable outcomes. Preventive strategies that target at-risk persons—i.e., especially those with baseline subsyndromal depression, greater anxiety symptoms, and more paranoid ideation and/or psychoses— may reduce the development of severe or persistent depression.

Abstract = {As more biracial and multiracial students enter the classroom, educators have begun to critically examine the concept of race. Through compelling student and teacher narratives, best-selling author Bonnie M. Davis gives voice to a frequently mislabeled and misunderstood segment of the population. Filled with research-based instructional strategies and reflective questions, the book supports readers in examining: The meaning of race, difference, and ethnicity; How mixed-identity students develop racial identities; How to adjust instruction to demonstrate cultural proficiency; and Complex questions to help deepen understanding of bi- and multiracial experiences, white privilege, and the history of race in the U.S. This sensitively written yet practical guide fills a gap in the professional literature by examining the experiences of biracial and multiracial students in the context of today's classrooms. The author calls upon readers to take a transformational journey toward racial literacy and ultimately become empowered by a real understanding of what it means to be biracial or multiracial and enable all students to experience increased self-confidence and believe in their ability to succeed.

Abstract = {Objectives: The objectives of this study were to describe the levels of daily spiritual experiences (DSEs) in community-dwelling older adults, to compare the levels of spiritual experiences with the levels of prayer and religious service attendance, and to examine the demographic and psychosocial correlates of spiritual experiences. The data came from 6534 participants in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, an ongoing population-based, biracial (65% African American) study of the risk factors for incident Alzheimer's disease among older adults. A 5-item version of the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale (DSES) was used in the study. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between sociodemographic and psychosocial factors and DSES scores. Results: The majority of the participants reported having spiritual experiences at least daily. In the bivariate analyses, African Americans and women had higher DSES scores than Whites and men, respectively (p's < 0.001). Prayer and worship were moderately associated with DSES scores. In the multivariable analyses, African American race, older age, female gender, better self-rated health, and greater social networks were associated with higher DSES scores, while higher levels of education and depressive symptoms were associated with lower DSES scores. Conclusion: We observed high levels of spiritual experiences and found that the DSES is related to, but distinct from the traditional measures of religiosity. We found associations between DSES, demographic, and psychosocial factors that are consistent with the findings for other religiosity and spirituality (R/S) measures. Future research should test whether DSES contributes to our understanding of the relationship between R/S and health in older adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Although more has been written about biracial people and about African American women's issues in recent years than in the past, very little has been done to explore the interface of gender and race as it impacts biracial women and girls. This lecture will consider whether biracial women are in multiple jeopardy, being Black (according to the "one-drop rule" that governs how race is constructed in the United States), female, and the product of a union of members of two antagonistic groups. Given the dearth of research specific to biracial women, the author attempts to construct an answer to this question through a discussion of the relevant theory and research on African American women, biracial people, biracial women and girls, and the social construction of race.

Abstract = {Stigmatized group members experience greater well-being in the presence of similar others, which may be driven by the perception that similar others value their shared stigmatized identities (i.e., high public regard). Using experience sampling methodology, this hypothesis is tested with biracial people (29 Asian/White, 23 Black/White, and 26 Latino/White biracial participants). This study proposes that the greater percentage of stigmatized similar others in one's daily context would predict greater daily well-being for biracial people through higher public regard, but only if biracial people believe that race has biological meaning. These findings add to a growing, but limited, literature on biracial individuals. These findings are situated within the broader literature on stigma and similar others, as well as new theories regarding the consequences of believing race has biological meaning.

Counseling research on racial identity development among multiracial people has largely overlooked the complexity of these individuals' social experiences and how their multiple realities result in various racial identities. The assumptions that individuals with one Black and one White parent can only understand themselves as "Black" or "biracial" have been socially, culturally and politically constructed, providing a misguided foundation for models of racial identity. Here, we present findings from a study of 177 biracial individuals that illustrate the multidimensionality of racial identity among this population. We focus on the mechanism of interactional validation in identity construction to better understand the particular dilemmas faced by biracial women and formulate appropriate therapeutic approaches.

Patterns of self-evaluation and psychological stress were examined as a function of both parentage and self-identification as either White or non-White. Biracial girls were compared with nonbiracial girls on all variables. Results indicated that outcomes vary as a function of parentage and ethnic self-identification and that there is broad variability among biracial girls from different backgrounds.

Biracial girls face all the developmental challenges of growing up female and the additional challenge of forging an identity in a society that presses them to choose a monocultural existence and disavow part of their ethnic heritage. Existing literature raises several potential issues for biracial girls in terms of identity development, social and sexual relationships, and family. Therapist ethnic awareness, client physical appearance, reasons for seeking treatment, level of identity development, and environmental considerations are discussed. Therapists are encouraged to offer a sociopolitical perspective, promote biracial/bicultural identity development, assist biracial girls in connecting with a multicultural community, and work collaboratively with parents in fostering the positive development of biracial girls.

Living in a race conscious society that was built upon practices of racial and gender oppression affects the physical, emotional and psychological well-being of women of color. When the factor of sexual orientation is added to the mix, the challenges are multiplied.

Results of a logistic regression analysis revealed that biracial college women with more favorable attitudes toward counseling were more likely to seek professional psychological help. In addition, biracial women with higher depression scores were more likely to seek professional mental health treatment. Implications of the findings for counseling center personnel are discussed.

Although the counseling profession has only recently taken notice of the growing biracial population in this country, the unique challenges that biracial women face have received little notice. The racist and sexist historical, political, economical, and social institutions that underlie American society have the potential of placing biracial women in a position of double jeopardy. The incorporation of two counseling perspectives, Multicultural Counseling and Therapy and Feminist Therapy, are suggested as a comprehensive approach to working with female biracial clients.

Studies increasingly show that biracial men and women have self-identities that embrace the racial and cultural heritages of both parents (Thompson, 1999). One of the greatest dilemmas that people with biracial identities face is the question of whom they should date and marry, since they may feel strong allegiances to both of their racioethnic heritages. Few studies have examined what occurs when individuals with multiracial identities seek romantic relationships. This study provides a qualitative analysis of the dating experiences of eight biracial women (one bisexual, seven heterosexual), the social and familial relationships that influence their choice of partners, the positive and negative sociocultural aspects of having a biracial female identity, and participant perspectives about the psychotherapeutic needs of biracial women. Although results suggested that the biracial participants were receptive towards individuals of other races and more likely to appreciate differences, some participants had racial preferences regarding their choice of partners. Therapeutic considerations for professionals who work with biracial women are presented based on the findings from this study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

For biracial women and girls, this approach may be particularly useful.

The existence of racially mixed persons in America challenges long-held notions about the biological, moral, and social meaning of race. In order to be effective in the therapeutic setting, therapists and counselors need to be aware of the socio-cultural factors encountered by this population and develop their interventions accordingly. The culturally competent psychologist needs to work from a framework that is not only sensitive to issues regarding minority identity development, but also incorporates an understanding of how biracial identity development differs from monoracial development. It is time to move beyond linear models of identity development that only examine how one deals with racial oppression or ethnic identification to a multidimensional framework that conceptualizes biracial women as racial/ethnic beings, gendered beings, sexual beings, mothers, daughters, partners, and friends. Therapists must be open to the multitude of ways their clients might choose to resolve their biracial identity and be able to facilitate exploration and movement toward goals that are consistent with each client's definition of what is healthy for her.

Abstract = {Black women suffer a disproportionately higher rate of obesity than their white counterparts. Reasons for this racial disparity may reflect underlying differences in the appetite suppressing peptide-YY (PYY). The PYY response to food is differentially influenced by macronutrient content but the effect of glycemic load on PYY response is unknown. This study examined whether glycemic load influences fasting and postprandial PYY levels and whether fasting and postprandial PYY levels are lower in obese black women compared to normal weight black women and to white women. Data were collected from 40 women (20 black, 20 white; 10 each normal weight vs. obese) at the University of North Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC). Participants completed in counterbalanced order two 4½-day weight-maintenance, mixed macronutrient high vs. low glycemic load diets followed by a test meal of identical composition. Total PYY levels were assessed before and after each test meal. Results show no differences in fasting PYY levels but significantly less postprandial PYY area under the curve (PYYAUC) in the group of obese black women compared to each other group (race × obesity interaction, P < 0.04). PYYAUC was positively related to insulin sensitivity (P < 0.004) but was not affected by glycemic load (main and interactive effects, P > 0.27). These findings indicate that postprandial PYY secretion is not affected by glycemic load but is blunted in obese black women compared with normal weight black women and with white women; additionally, they begin to address whether blunted PYY secretion contributes uniquely to the pathogenesis of obesity in black women.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine whether a higher body mass index (BMI) in older adults is associated with greater cognitive decline. Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted from 1993 to 2003 with an average follow-up of 6.4 years of a biracial community population on the south side of Chicago. Participants were 3,885 community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older who participated in at least two assessments. A composite measure of global cognitive function was used which was derived from the average of standardized scores from four cognitive tests. Results: There was a significant curvilinear association between BMI and cognitive function scores at baseline for both black (= -0.0014, p = 0.001) and non-black subjects (= -0.0011, p = 0.002). In a mixed model adjusted for age, sex, race, and education, higher BMI was associated with less cognitive decline in both black (= 0.0013, p = 0.009) and non-black subjects (= 0.0021, p = 0.006). Adjusting for comorbid illnesses did not change these findings substantially. However, the associations were much smaller and no longer significant among participants with no cognitive decline at baseline as measured by a Mini-Mental State Examination score of greater than 24. Conclusions: The findings suggest that greater body mass index in old age is not predictive of cognitive decline in a cognitively unimpaired community population.

Specifically, the chapter will address identity problems different from the norm for children who have different parentage. In addition the chapter will (1) provide a theoretical model for conceptualizing biracial experiences; (2) address the variable of skin color that confronts biracial children; (3) examine identity issues of biracial children and feelings of not totally belonging to one or the other part of their ethnic and racial heritage; (4) report on the pressures imposed on children to accept the beliefs and background of one parent in opposition to the other, and frustration in attempts to incorporate ethnic/racial heritage into their own self identity; and (5) explore feelings of social rejection experienced by children due to manifestations of prejudicial racism in the American society. Finally, the chapter will present a model that will enhance the study and assessment of biracial children who represent a part of America's future generation.

Abstract = {Sixty-one Biracial participants were assessed on measures of depression, trait anxiety, and social anxiety to ascertain if their racial identity choice impacted their scores on these psychological measures. Societal pressure to identify as monoracial was also measured to determine if the various racial identity groups perceived these pressures differently and if these pressures were related to the reported quality of psychological functioning. Results indicated that a validated Biracial identity may serve as a protective factor for anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas Biracial individuals who consider their race to be meaningless or fluid based on situational factors reported significantly higher levels of depression and trait anxiety symptoms than other Biracial individuals. The latter group also reported the least pressure from family to identify as monoracial.

Abstract = {Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99, the authors examine the extent to which biracial families differ from monoracial families in their transmission of resources to young children. In these analyses, the authors demonstrate the utility of distinguishing not only between white-biracial and nonwhite-biracial families and but also between even more refined measures of biracial families (e.g., white father/Asian mother). The authors find that, in most cases, biracial families provide comparable or greater economic and cultural resources to their children than do their monoracial counterparts, but offer fewer advantages in interactional/social resources. This overall pattern remains even after sociodemographic factors are taken into consideration. Exceptions to this pattern also are identified and explored. Implications for our understanding of racial stratification, interracial relations, and the role of both human agency and constraints on intergenerational transmission of resources are discussed.

Abstract = {There are very few psychoanalytic articles describing the psychodynamics of a biracial treatment. In the last years the wealth of articles emphasize the white-Black dichotomy; the patient is white or Black or the therapist is Black or white. The common theme of these papers is the need for awareness of transference-countertransference responses when working with someone ethnically different. Most of the non-psychoanalytic papers discuss the difficulties of biracial identity development and its effects in the individual's future life. In ethnically different or similar dyads, the therapist needs to exercise particular caution against applying his or her personal assumptions and metapsychology about minds at large. Whether the therapist's attitudes fall within the range of despondency, sadness or guilt over the patient's life circumstances, or whether the therapist's reactions run the spectrum of puzzlement, fear, ethnic prejudice or dislike, they will be detectable by our patients. The clinical case that follows is an example of how our identities are shaped through our social interaction with others, how biracial people whose chosen racial identity is consistently invalidated by others are at risk of psychological distress, and how our ethnic identity influences the transference-countertransference.

Abstract = {Investigates whether there are differences in the meanings for and/or experiences of marriage among African-American, European-American, and biracial couples. A sample of convenience including two African-American, two European-American, and two biracial couples (aged 24–47) was used in this study. There were three parts to the research process. First, demographic information was collected using a standard questionnaire. Then the researchers asked the couple to jointly tell the story of their relationship from their initial meeting to their current experience. Finally, spouses were asked individually to respond to a question regarding his or her meanings for marriage. Findings suggest that the three groups of couples held a positive view of marriage. However, the two African-American couples simultaneously held negative meanings of marriage. In regard to the experience of marriage, results suggest that the tensions expressed by the African-American and European-American couples were quite similar. The problems centered on issues related to the internal dynamics of the couple. In contrast, the biracial couples experienced tensions related to the intrusiveness of friends and family, which they described as external to the relationship.

This chapter will examine some of the groundbreaking research and critical thought at the heart of the transracial adoption controversy, which centers primarily on the identity formation of Black and Biracial children adopted by White parents. This chapter aims to serve as a critical review of the literature and theory relevant to transracial adoption and as a practical resource for adoptive parents and those who are affected by and, in turn, affect the lives of transracial adoptees so that they can develop psychologically, culturally, and spiritually. Finally, this chapter will consider where we go from here.

Abstract = {Objective: To assess mortality associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) among older African Americans and whites from an urban community. Design: Longitudinal population-based observational study. Setting: Four adjacent neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois. Participants: Persons deemed free of dementia in a previous wave of data collection (n = 1715) underwent detailed clinical evaluation: 802 had no cognitive impairment (46.8%), 597 had MCI (34.8%), 296 had AD (17.3%), and 20 had other forms of dementia (1.2%). Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality. Results: During as many as 10 years of observation (mean [SD], 4.7 [3.0] years), 634 individuals died (37.0%). Compared with people without cognitive impairment, risk of death was increased by about 50% among those with MCI (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.48 [1.22-1.80]) and was nearly 3-fold greater among those with AD (2.84 [2.29-3.52]). These effects were seen among African Americans and whites and did not differ by race. Among participants with MCI, risk of death increased with more severe cognitive impairment, and this effect did not vary by race. A similar effect was seen among participants with AD, but it was slightly stronger for African Americans vs whites. In the MCI and AD groups, the association of cognitive impairment with survival was stronger for perceptual speed than for other cognitive functions. Conclusion: The presence and severity of MCI and AD are associated with reduced survival among African Americans, and these effects are comparable to those seen among whites.

Abstract = {Empirical research on multiraciality and the development of richer models of racial identity have increased in the last decade. Increased attention to such phenomena has lead to the "check all that apply" modification to the 2000 Census-an official recognition of an historical reality not before reflected on the United States' Census. However, "identity" and "identification" are different phenomena. Using Place-level data from Census 2000 as well as data from the Survey of Biracial Experience (Rockquemore and Brunsma, 2001), this paper will reveal the geographic distribution of black-white biracial individuals via the Census and compare it to the geographic distribution of biracials' racial self-understandings from survey methods. The findings illuminate the multifaceted relationship between public categorization and private racial identification. Finally, the implications for utilizing the new Census data for studying black-white and other mixed populations are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {We examined whether or not priming racial identity would influence Black-White biracial individuals' ability to visually search for White and Black faces. Black, White, and biracial participants performed a visual search task in which the targets were Black or White faces. Before the task, the biracial participants were primed with either their Black or their White racial identity. All participant groups detected Black faces faster than White faces. Critically, the results also showed a racial-prime effect in biracial individuals: The magnitude of the search asymmetry was significantly different for those primed with their White identity and those primed with their Black identity. These findings suggest that top-down factors such as one's racial identity can influence mechanisms underlying the visual search for faces of different races.

Abstract = {The relationship between smoking status and incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) was investigated in a random stratified sample of a biracial community in Chicago. Analyses are based on 1,064 persons (of 1,134 evaluated) who had data on smoking status, disease incidence, and key covariates such as apolipoprotein allele status. During a mean of about 4 years of follow-up, 170 persons met criteria for incident AD. Current smoking was associated with increased risk of incident AD (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.4-8.0) compared to persons who never smoked. There was no apparent increase in risk of AD for former smokers compared to persons who never smoked (OR = 0.9,95% CI = 0.5-1.7). Apolipoprotein E allele status modified this association in that former smokers with a ε4 allele were less likely to develop AD (p = 0.04) than those who never smoked. Former smokers also appeared to have a reduced risk of developing AD as their pack-years of smoking increased (p = 0.02) such that the odds of developing AD increased by 50% for every 10 years of smoking cessation (OR = 1.3, CI = 0.9-1.7). The results suggest that older people who currently smoke are more likely to develop AD compared to those who never smoked; the relation between those who used to smoke but quit and the risk of AD is complex and requires further research.

Abstract = {This chapter reviews research that has been conducted on biracial people since 1992. A search of several databases in psychology, education, sociology/social work, and psychiatry yielded approximately 30 published studies focusing on this topic. Most of the studies examined psychological adjustment issues and identity development in biracial people. The chapter is organized in the following way. First, a very brief description of current race and racial identity models is given to provide a theoretical basis for some of the research that has been conducted, (although a large number of the studies seem to yield their own theories of identity development.) A review of current issues and difficulties in conducting research on biracial people follows. Then a review of studies on biracial people is arranged according to two primary topic areas: psychological functioning and identity development. Finally, the implications of this review for future research and theory development are identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 6.8 million people, or 2.4% of the national population, identified themselves by two or more races (i.e., biracial or multiracial; Jones & Smith, 2001). Nearly 1.8 million of these individuals reported being Black or African American in combination with another racial or ethnic group. Reported population figures regarding biracial African Americans, however, may be underestimations of the actual size of this population (Brown, 1995; Root, 1996). In particular, the degree to which parents of interracial children address their children's racial group orientation and how people of mixed race heritage identify with either or both racial groups may influence population estimates (Winn & Priest, 1993). In this chapter, we provide some background information pertaining to the historical and current experiences of biracial and multiracial African Americans. We also discuss considerations in the self-identification process for biracial and multiracial African Americans, and we present several prominent identity development models for biracial and multiracial people. In addition, we present issues that mental health counselors might wish to consider when working with biracial and multiracial African Americans.

Abstract = {Background: Findings from studies investigating whether physical activity reduces the risk of cognitive decline in old age have been inconsistent. Objective: To examine whether participation in physical activity by older adults reduces the rate of cognitive decline after accounting for participation in cognitively stimulating activities. Design: A prospective population study conducted from August 1993 to January 2003, with an average follow- up of 6.4 years. Setting: A biracial community population on the south side of Chicago. Participants: Participants were 4055 community-dwelling adults 65 years and older who were able to walk across a small room and had participated in at least 2 of the 3 follow-up assessments. Main Outcome Measure: Annual rate of cognitive change as measured by a global cognitive score, which consisted of averaged standardized scores from 4 cognitive tests. Results: In a mixed model adjusted for age, sex, race, and education, each additional physical activity hour per week was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline by 0.0007 U/y (P= .04). However, with further adjustments (1) for participation in cognitive activities (β̂ = .0006, p=.10), (2) for depression and vascular diseases (β̂ = .0005, P=.19), and (3) by excluding participants whose global cognitive score at baseline was at or below the 10th percentile (β̂ = .0002, P=.45), the coefficients were smaller and no longer statistically significant. Conclusion: These data do not support the hypothesis that physical activity alone protects against cognitive decline among older adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The papers in this volume represent different levels of insight into the experience of being a biracial woman. Some authors present experiences that are unique to biracial women, while others focus on areas of experience that are common among both biracial women and men. Some are very personal/intimate expressions of the complexity of finding a biracial identity without a supportive community. Each provides a building block to the construction of theory and practice in work with biracial women. We thought it was important to include diverse perspectives on a very complex set of issues related to biracial women. We invite readers to engage in both internal and interactive dialogues about the issues raised in these papers, taking no conclusion at face value, but examining all with a critical and integrative eye. In the following overview, we will point out areas of contrast and agreement in perspective among some of the authors and we encourage the reader to do the same. We hope that by doing so, new questions will emerge that can be researched and that will contribute to our greater understanding of biracial women and the ways that gender affects their experiences.

This article examines the impact that a heightened awareness of race as a social construct has on the relationship between racial stereotypes and performance. Study 1 finds that multiracial individuals reported subscribing less to the notion that race biologically determines ability. Study 2 finds that monoracial individuals show stereotype activation, whereas multiracial individuals show stereotype inhibition in reaction to race salience. Study 3 draws on the work on stereotypes and performance to test the susceptibility of multiracial individuals to racial stereotypes about ability. The authors find that Asian/White and Black/White multiracial individuals were less susceptible to racial stereotypes than monoracial individuals. Whereas monoracial participants showed significant performance changes in reaction to race salience, multiracial individuals did not. Study 4 finds that emphasizing the social construction of race buffers individuals from stereotype threat effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: We investigated whether depressive symptoms, assessed by the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), predicted change in physical function in elderly adults. Methods: Participants were from a biracial, population-based sample of adults aged 65 and older (N: 4069; 61% black; 61% female). Physical function was assessed as a summary performance measure of tandem stand, measured walk, and repeated chair stand (mean [standard deviation], 10.3 [3.5]; range, 0-15), commonly used measures of overall physical health in older adults. Generalized estimating equation models estimated physical function across 3 assessments over 5.4 years of follow up as a function of CES-D scores at baseline. Results: Adjusting for age, sex, race, and education, each 1-point higher CES-D score was associated with a 0.34-point lower absolute level of physical performance (p < .0001), but there was no evidence of a CES-D by time interaction (p = .84), indicating that depressive symptoms at baseline were not associated with greater physical performance decline over time. In secondary analyses, with CES-D scores modeled in 4 categories, overall physical performance showed a graded, inverse association across CES-D categories (p's < .0001). However, we observed no threshold effect for depressive symptoms in relation to change in physical performance. Compared with the referent group (CES-D = 0), the 2 middle CES-D categories (CES-D = 1 or 2-3) evidenced some decline in physical performance over time, but the highest CES-D group (CES-D ≥4) showed no significant physical decline over time (p = .89). Conclusion: We observed a strong cross-sectional association between depressive symptoms and overall physical performance. Physical function declined over time, yet depressive symptoms did not consistently contribute to greater decline over an average of 5.4 years of follow up among older adults. Findings highlight the importance of longitudinal models in understanding the relation between depressive symptomatology and physical health.

Abstract = {Consequent to Eurocentric hegemony race has been erroneously validated as the standard identity construct by social work education as well as much of Western science. For example, the approach utilized in this study includes reference to the literature of biologists and medical personnel who contend that race is scientifically meaningless. Findings: The findings suggest that for those who are biracial, living in the midst of race constructionists encourages a life of identity conflict. That conflict is more often irrelevant to mono-race subjects who by skin color are assigned to a single race category. This is an important notion for those, such as social workers, working in the human services. Applications: The application proposes a human development across the lifespan construct to serve as an ecological alternative to the pathologizing influences of race. Although race and other Eurocentric constructs may have had their place at one time, the rapidly changing demographic dynamics of Western populations, including Britain, Europe and the Americas, and the inconceivable pace at which diversity is becoming the norm necessitate a commensurate change in policy, practice and theory. Identity across the lifespan in preparation of social workers for the 21st century is a viable alternative. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

This study examined self-esteem, ethnic identity, and the relationship between these constructs among biracial and monoracial adolescents (n = 3282). Using analysis of covariance, significant differences emerged between biracial and monoracial adolescents on both a measure of self-esteem and a measure of ethnic identity. Specifically, biracial adolescents showed significantly higher levels of self-esteem than their Asian counterparts, but significantly lower selfesteem than Black adolescents. Furthermore, biracial adolescents scored significantly higher than Whites on a measure of ethnic identity, but scored lower than their Black, Asian, and Latino peers on the same measure. Finally, correlational analyses revealed a significant and positive relationship between ethnic identity and self-esteem for all groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Historically, race has been constructed within the American psyche as a dichotomous variable--an either-or proposition. Moreover, our construction and use of language have developed to mirror this reality, which ultimately aids in its perpetuation. Has this divergent approach to race outlived its usefulness and applicability? Is it realistic, given the face of today's changing demographic landscape? At present, there remain cultural and linguistic disconnects between the phenomenological experience of the biracial individual and the expectations of the dualistic society within which they reside. On the individual level, there are implications for psychosocial development (Hall, 2001; Root, 1995). More broadly speaking, what will develop from the resolution of this dilemma is a new paradigm impacting how the citizens of this country view race and racial identity. This paper explores the impact that the sociohistorical constructions of race and language have on the lives of biracial individuals. To this end, the author, who is biracial, will blend sociohistorical conceptions of race and linguistic philosophy with personal narrative components and conclude with implications for multiracial identity development.

One of the greatest dilemmas that people with biracial identities face is the question of whom they should date and marry, since they may feel strong allegiances to both of their racioethnic heritages. Few studies have examined what occurs when individuals with multiracial identities seek romantic relationships. This study provides a qualitative analysis of the dating experiences of eight biracial women (one bisexual, seven heterosexual), the social and familial relationships that influence their choice of partners, the positive and negative sociocultural aspects of having a biracial female identity, and participant perspectives about the psychotherapeutic needs of biracial women. Although results suggested that the biracial participants were receptive towards individuals of Other races and more likely to appreciate differences, some participants had racial preferences regarding their choice of partners.

Abstract = {Discusses biracial women in therapy. The existence of racially mixed persons in America challenges long-held notions about the biological, moral, and social meaning of race. In order to be effective in the therapeutic setting, therapists and counselors need to be aware of the socio-cultural factors encountered by this population and develop their interventions accordingly. The culturally competent psychologist needs to work from a framework that is not only sensitive to issues regarding minority identity development, but also incorporates an understanding of how biracial identity development differs from monoracial development. It is time to move beyond linear models of identity development that only examine how one deals with racial oppression or ethnic identification to a multidimensional framework that conceptualizes biracial women as racial/ethnic beings, gendered beings, sexual beings, mothers, daughters, partners, and friends. Therapists must be open to the multitude of ways their clients might choose to resolve their biracial identity and be able to facilitate exploration and movement toward goals that are consistent with each client's definition of what is healthy for her.

What contextual and systemic dimensions of these families do therapists need to understand to work with them effectively? In most aspects of family functioning, biracial lesbian-led adoptive families are more similar to other subsets of families than different. Concerns for their children's health, safety, education, and future are embedded in the everyday activities and choices of the parents. Yet the multiple group identities that these families reflect simultaneously position them in both dominant and nondominant groups within society. It is the dynamic interaction of these group identities that we wish to highlight here, providing guidance to therapists in approaching these families from a feminist perspective that affirms both the challenges and the strengths these families demonstrate.

The results indicated school level, years of counseling experience, and gender influenced certain perceptions. School counselors' perceptions were also affected by the presence of actively promoted cultural diversity and awareness programs. When cultural diversity and awareness programs are actively promoted in schools, they create an environment in which a variety of cultures are celebrated and genuinely valued.

Abstract = {Using 16 in-depth interviews drawn from a larger sample of Black/White biracial individuals (aged 18-46 yrs), this article explores how gender shapes the microlevel process of racial identity construction. It is maintained that skin color stratification within the Black community, combined with a low rate of marriageable men and high rates of interracial marriages among the most educated and affluent Black men, has created a social context that differentiates the interactional experiences of biracial men and women. The findings highlight the need for more complex theoretical conceptualizations of how gender shapes the way that women negotiate their racial identities in post-Civil Rights America.

Abstract = {Examined racial identity construction among biracial individuals. 177 biracial college students (aged 15-58 yrs) completed surveys regarding biracial identity, racial composition of social networks, negative experiences, affinities toward Blacks and Whites as groups, self-reported skin color, and perceptions of how others view them. Rockquemore's taxonomy of racial identity options (1999) was used as a framework to determine the Ss' understandings of their racial identities. Results show a great deal of variation in the racial composition of both preadult and adult social networks. Ss' contextual experiences of race varied widely. On average, Ss experienced fairly high levels of negative treatment from both Blacks and Whites. There was significant variation in biracial individuals' feelings of closeness toward Blacks and Whites as groups. Significant variation was observed concerning both the self-perceived skin color index and socially perceived appearance. Findings support a multidimensional view of racial identity by illustrating that biracial people make various identity choices, albeit choices that are differentially available due to an individual's structural location.

A biracial individual may assume a multiplicity of identities, including African-, Asian-, Latino-, and Native-American when negotiating with large institutions, including those providing social services. As an alternative to traditional, static views of race, the identity-across-the-lifespan model provides a more comprehensive paradigm for biracial clients. In the aftermath clients will be rendered visible by such an identity model, which prevails less on the basis of race and more on the basis of lifetime experience. It is concluded that biracial clients require the option, at least, to identify themselves rather than be identified by superficial racial characteristics.

Abstract = {In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget announced that a multiracial category would not be added to the 2000 census. This decision followed a protracted and heated debate. The primary reason why the authors undertook this project was to address the scarcity of empirical research that informed the 2000 census debate. The goal of this book is to provide analysis of a quantity of data that has heretofore been unavailable and to provide the quality of analysis that enables answers to important and enduring questions about racial identity. The addition of a multiracial category will most likely emerge once again as preparations are made for the 2010 census; therefore, the authors' hope for this project is twofold. First, they hope that this study will open a new path toward a more empirically based and less emotionally laden discourse on multiracialism. Second they hope that the findings reported in this book will open the debate about a multiracial category in the 2010 census to a more dynamic, multifaceted understanding of what biracial identity means to members of this population. The authors also hope that their work will be of interest ot parents of biracial children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (preface)},

Abstract = {Two biracial college freshmen (17 and 19 yrs old), both of whom identify as Black, were chosen from a larger sample of participants in a qualitative study of biracial identity development to exemplify the differences in the paths that 2 biracial individuals could take to achieve racial identity resolution. Through the case study method, the authors describe the course and progression of racial identity development (RID) in these 2 individuals and discuss some key themes in their lives that have contributed to the development of their RID. The purposes are fourfold: to describe, nonclinical subjective experiences of being biracial in the US, to explore the differences in the paths that 2 biracial individuals can take to achieve what looks superficially like similar Black racial identity resolution, to demonstrate how identifying as Black can have different meanings and consequences for 2 biracial people, and to contribute to the differentiation of Black RID from biracial Black/White RID. The authors raise questions about the generalizability of monoracial Black and ethnic identity theories to biracial individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Older women treated with conjugated estrogens may have an increased risk of dementia, but the effect of naturally occurring sex hormones on cognition is not certain. Methods: Bioavailable estradiol and free testosterone level were obtained from 792 (55% men, 51% black) participants. We assessed cognition with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS), Selective Reminding Test (SRT) and CLOX 1 at baseline and 2 years later. Results: Women in the lowest estradiol tertile were more likely than those in the highest tertile to decline (≥1.0 S.D. of change) on 3MS (25% versus 9%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-9.6) and on SRT (28% versus 12%, adjusted OR [95% CI] = 3.3 [1.4-7.9]) but not CLOX 1. There was a borderline association between low estradiol tertile and decline on SRT in men (22% versus 14%, adjusted OR [95% CI] = 1.9 [0.9-3.9]). Testosterone level was not associated with decline in cognition in either men or women. Findings did not differ by race. Conclusions: Older women with low estradiol levels were more likely to experience decline in global cognitive function and verbal memory, and a similar trend was observed for verbal memory in men. This supports the hypothesis that endogenous sex hormones may play an important role in the maintenance of cognitive function in older adults.

The sample was sedentary at baseline and more varied in physical activity 24 months later. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to estimate the number of PAR assessments necessary to obtain a reliability of 0.70 at both time-points. Methods: The PAR was administered ≤ 30 d apart at baseline (n = 547) and 24 months (n = 648). Energy expenditure ICC was calculated by race, gender, and age. Results: Baseline reliability was low for all groups with 4-16 PARs estimated to attain reliable data. ICCs at 24 months were similar (ICC = 0.54-0.55) for race and age group, with 2-3 PARs estimated to reach acceptable reliability. At 24 months, women were more reliable reporters than men. Conclusion: Low sample variability in activity reduced reliability, highlighting the importance of evaluating diverse groups. Despite evaluating a sample with greater physical activity variability, an estimated 2-3 PARs were necessary to obtain acceptable reliability.

Data was drawn from the core sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The Add Health public-use data set includes interviews of 6,504 adolescents and 4,600 parents. On the Add Health survey, adolescents were asked multiple questions to assess their racial/ethnic background. Results suggest that biracial/biethnic youth are a particularly vulnerable group in terms of self-reported delinquency, school problems, internalizing symptoms, and self-regard. As a group, they are also more likely to receive some form of psychological intervention. Given these findings and the shortcoming of clinical resources for work with this population, the authors provide a discussion of why biracial youth may be particularly vulnerable from a social constructionist framework and offer several strategies based on narrative family therapy for working with biracial youngsters and their families.

Abstract = {There is considerable controversy regarding the means by which bisexual and biracial individuals achieve a sense of identity. In this paper, the concepts of bisexual and biracial identity are reviewed, and the literature on identity developmental models are critiqued. Further, a qualitative study is presented that explored the complexity of biracial identity development in 15 20–40 yr old Japanese-Americans. Ss explored identity options attempting to develop their own meaning of identity, to develop a confident sense of themselves and secure a positive ethnic identity. Based on research and dialogue, there appears to be parallels between bisexual and biracial identity development. A model is proposed that suggests that individuals who are bisexual or biracial go through four phases in their development of their positive identity. These phases are: Phase I—Questioning/Confusion; Phase II—Refusal/Suppression; Phase III—Infusion/Exploration; and Phase IV—Resolution/Acceptance. These phases describe people who have two distinct identities that place them in a position of self-devaluation. From there they move to a position where there is a positive perception of identity based on the coexistence of their identities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Identity development among participants varied. It was a long-term process involving changes in the individual–environment relationship, which differed in the way individual participants influenced or selected from environmental opportunities, even creating or recreating some aspects. Within a given setting, as youths, the potential for social experiences were relatively fixed and changed only gradually. As adults, there were opportunities for participants to select their own social and geographic settings, providing opportunity for change. In their new environments, participants were exposed to new contacts and role models, acquired new behavioral repertoire, and underwent role transitions. Depending on this, new and different aspects of biracial identity developed. Participants indicated it was an emotional and conflictual process to positive assertion of identity. Before reaching this, all of the participants experienced periods of confusion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Frequent participation in cognitively stimulating activities has been associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) in several prospective studies. More than 4,000 older residents of a geographically defined biracial community of Chicago were interviewed at approximately 3-year intervals for an average of 5.3 years. Each interview included administration of four cognitive function tests from which a previously established global measure was derived. At baseline, each person rated frequency of participation in cognitively stimulating activities (e.g., reading a magazine) from which a previously established composite measure of cognitive activity was derived. Cognitive activity scores ranged from 1 to 5 (mean = 3.14, SD = 0.66), with higher scores indicating more frequent participation. More frequent cognitive activity was associated with reduced cognitive decline during follow-up. In a model that controlled for baseline level of cognition, age, sex, race, and education, a 1-point increase in cognitive activity score was associated with an approximately 19% decrease in annual rate of cognitive decline (p < 0.001). Frequent participation in cognitively stimulating activities is associated with reduced cognitive decline in older persons. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Describes biracial and bicultural adolescents as an emerging population of young people who have some unique characteristics, some potential problems, and some special needs--all of which are related to their ambiguous ethnicity and their need to define their identities in a society where race has always been a significant dimension. It is argued that although this chapter focuses primarily on the offspring of African American and White and Latino couples, the issues they must confront and resolve are similar in nature, if not severity, to those of other youth in interracial and interethnic families. Major points highlighted in this chapter are (1) historical background, (2) mental health issues, including case vignettes, (3) conflict and coping strategies, (4) sociocultural issues in assessment, and (5) implications for intervention and treatment.

Abstract = {Administered Portuguese translations of the Color Meaning Test II and Preschool Racial Attitude Measure II to 29 Black, 30 biracial, and 29 White 8-yr-olds attending public school in Lisbon, Portugal, to assess skin color bias. White skin and light-skin biases were found among the three groups, providing additional evidence that the pro-white and pro-light-skin biases are pancultural tendencies. The biases were not found to be different by gender, but they were significantly different by race. Mean color attitudes of White children were significantly different from biracial children, such that the White Ss displayed a stronger pro-white/anti-black bias than the biracial Ss. Mean racial attitudes of White Ss also showed more pro-light skin bias than black and biracial children. It is suggested that the biracial category be considered in research on color and racial attitudes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

With data from 7,808 biracial children (aged 0–14 yrs), extracted from the 5-percent Public Use Microdata Sample of the 1990 census, the authors take into account explanatory variables at 3 levels: the child's characteristics, the parents' characteristics, and the locale's racial composition. Results indicate that the racial identification of biracial children with an Asian parent is to a large extent an arbitrary option within today's prevailing racial classification scheme. Empirical evidence supports the theoretical proposition that both assimilation and awareness of Asian heritage affect the racial identification of biracial children with an Asian parent.

At baseline and 3-year follow-up, we interviewed 4245 community residents (61.4% Black, 38.4% White, 0.20% other) aged 65 years or older. We used logistic regression to test predictors of beginning caregiving among baseline noncaregivers and of continuing caregiving among baseline caregivers. Results. After control for demographic variables, physically healthier individuals were significantly more likely to become caregivers and to continue caregiving. Mental health had little influence on beginning caregiving, but declining mental heath was associated with continuing caregiving. Conclusions. Maintenance of physical health and function is essential to the ability of older adults to begin and to continue caregiving. Studies that compare the health of current caregivers with that of noncaregivers may substantially underestimate the impact of caregiving on health.

The editors argue that the hope for managing America's troubles with "race" lies not only with communicating about race at public meetings, in school, and in the media, but also with families communicating constructively about race at home. The authors in this book investigate such topics as how Black families communicate to manage the issue of racism; how Black parent–child communication is used to manage the derogation of Black children; the role of television in family communication about race; the similarities and differences between communication in Black, White, and biracial couples and families; and how family communication education can contribute to a brighter future for all. With the aim of developing a clearer understanding of the role that family communication plays in society's move toward a multicultural world, this volume provides a crucial examination of how families struggle with issues of ethnic cultural diversity.

Abstract = {Discusses problems and identity conflicts faced by biracial children (BRC) and the role that elementary and middle school counselors can play in mitigating these difficulties. BRC are vulnerable, face social rejection by their peers, and receive ambivalent attention in their schools and communities. They also face conflicts about biracial identity, social marginality, sexuality, separation from parents, and career aspirations. Counselors must develop a positive working relationship with BRC and their families and must help BRC to build their self-esteem as unique individuals by identifying and supporting the children's positive coping mechanisms, abilities, and interests independent of racial heritage.

Findings from the Preschool Racial Attitude Measure II (PRAM II) indicate that mean preferences of biracial Ss were not significantly different from either of their monoracial cohorts. However, mean preferences of Black and White Ss were significantly different, such that White Ss were more pro-White than Black Ss. PRAM II scores for biracial Ss were primarily based on the combination of positive affect toward White and negative affect toward Black. Although Black Ss made negative choices toward Black, their racial attitude score was dependent on the balance of positive choices for Black and White.

A biracial community sample of 2,550 older African Americans and Whites (aged 65 yrs and older) was genotyped for APOE, tested for cholesterol, and evaluated for depression at both baseline and 4-yr followup (1,529 of the original participants). Results show no relationship between the ε4 allele and depression or low cholesterol and depression in either cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. The interaction of the ε4 allele and cholesterol was also not associated with depression in controlled analyses. Female gender, less education, being unmarried, and cognitive impairment were associated with depression in cross-sectional controlled analyses; only cognitive impairment was associated with depression in longitudinal analyses. Despite the association of the ε4 allele with a number of adverse health outcomes, as well as the association between depression and cholesterol in previous studies, no association was found between ε4 and low cholesterol or depression in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The interaction of ε4 and cholesterol was not associated with depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Blood pressure had a curvilinear association with cognitive performance in linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, race and education. Scores were lower by 2-5 percentiles at 100mm Hg systolic pressure compared to scores at the mean of 140mm Hg and lower by <1 percentile at 180mm Hg. For diastolic pressure, scores were lower by 2-3 percentiles at 60mm Hg and by 1-2 percentiles at 100mm Hg compared to scores at the mean (77mm Hg). The differences in the scores with low blood pressure were reduced with further adjustment for body mass index, self-perceived health status, depressive symptoms, alcohol use and smoking. The curvilinear associations were stronger among persons with histories of stroke, myocardial infraction and hypertension. The cross-sectional association between blood pressure and cognitive functions is small and curvilinear and more apparent in persons with cardiovascular conditions.

Analysis included the presentation of variables that the mothers identified as a part of the child rearing practices to promote the dual heritages of the bi-racial children. These mothers formed 2 perspectives in promoting identity development: self-concept and identity were viewed as paramount issues for development by the mothers. Mothers' child rearing practices included making the children feel that they could accomplish anything, informing them of the difference of their biracial heritage, and providing exposure to racial difference in the general population.

Abstract = {The relation of BP to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex because both an association of high BP with increased risk of the disease and lower BP as a consequence of the disease are possible. The authors examined the cross-sectional association of BP and AD in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a study of a geographically defined, biracial community. After in-home interviews with 6,162 residents ≥65 years, a stratified random sample of 729 Ss was clinically evaluated; 709 had BP measured, and 243 were diagnosed with AD. In categorical analyses prevalence of AD was higher among persons with low systolic pressure compared with the referent group, and with low diastolic pressure compared to the referent. High systolic and diastolic categories were not different from the referent group, although there was some evidence that the associations differed by race. The odds ratios changed little with further adjustment for apolipoprotein E genotype, antihypertensive medications, body mass, stroke, diabetes, and heart disease. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing associations between low blood pressure and AD, but longitudinal studies are needed to characterize cause-and-effect associations.

Simple structure yielding unique components for each of the SPPC domains was obtained for White but not Black girls, whether analyzed overall or by parental education level. Internal consistency was higher for White girls in both years. The lack of simple structure was reflected in the higher correlations among the subscales for Black girls. The structure and internal consistency improved in Year 3 for Black girls, indicating that the physical appearance and athletic competence domains were not yet fully differentiated at baseline.

Abstract = {The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been associated with health-related outcomes that may adversely affect quality of life (QOL) in older adults. In the absence of published information, we sought to determine whether the ε4 allele was associated with subjective QOL across 5 parameters in a community sample of older adults. This article is a prospective cohort study. The setting is a community-based sample of older adults in North Carolina. The participants are Self-responding genotyped sample members (n =1,880). The measurements included APOE genotype and five newly constructed, reliable, and valid measures of subjective QOL derived from the Duke EPESE questionnaire. The 5 parameters measured were social, economic, mental and physical health, and functional status. Control variables included age, gender, race, education and urban/rural residence. In controlled longitudinal analysis, older age women predicted poorer functional status; being African American, and reporting lower education predicted poorer subjective economic well-being. Concludingly, considered from a public health perspective, these findings challenge the uncritical assumption that the presence of this susceptibility gene in the population implies an excess burden of poor QOL.

Abstract = {Describes a qualitative study of issues salient in the development of racial identity for schoolchildren of Black/White racial heritage. Semistructured interviews were conducted individually with 9 Black/White biracial children and their parents (a total of 6 families). Major findings from this study tend to run counter to problems conjectured in the counseling and related literature. For example, in contrast to deficit models, participant children and adolescents did not appear to perceive themselves as "marginal" in 2 cultures. The majority of participant children, adolescents, and adults demonstrated sensitivity to the views, cultures, and values of both the Black and White communities. Developmental transitions associated with different ages were identified. Emergent themes yielded hypotheses with implications for future research.

Abstract = {This study examined the relationship between smoking status and weight change from baseline to Year 7 in a large biracial cohort, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. Unadjusted for covariates, only male smokers weighed less than nonsmokers, with no effect among women. Adjusted for covariates, male and female smokers weighed less than nonsmokers at baseline, adjusted for age, total energy intake, alcohol intake, and physical fitness. Over the 7-year follow-up, all smoking status groups gained weight, including continuous smokers and initiators. Weight gain was greatest among those who quit smoking. Weight gain attributable to smoking cessation was 4.2 kg for Whites and 6.6 kg for Blacks. Smoking had a small weight-attenuating effect on Blacks. No such effects, however, were observed among Whites. These results suggest, at least in younger smokers, that smoking has minimal impact on body weight.

The Revised Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns was used to establish BED status among 3,948 Ss aged 28–40 yrs. Body mass index (BMI) was used to define overweight. Depressive symptomatology was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Prevalence of BED was 1.5% in the cohort overall, with similar rates among Black women, White women, and White men. Black men had substantially lower BED rates. Depressive symptomatology was markedly higher among individuals with BED. Among overweight Ss, BED prevalence was almost double that of the overall cohort. There were no differences in BED rates between overweight Black and White women. Thus, BED was common in the general population, with comparable rates among Black women, White women, and White men, but low rates among Black men. Obesity was associated with substantially higher prevalence of BED. Treatment studies that target obese men and minority women with BED are indicated.

Participants were 6751 (5,607 African American, 1,144 White) seventh-grade students participating in an evaluation of smoking determinants in adolescence. In addition to providing, in this survey design, information about their smoking status, participants self-reported both their height and weight, which was converted into a BMI. Contrary to predictions, smoking was positively related to BMI. That is, with increasing levels of smoking exposure, BMI significantly increased. Thus, it appears that smoking is not related to lowered BMI in adolescent populations. Implications and possible reasons for these findings are discussed.

The authors explored whether children's perceptions of caretaker harshness and unjustness of physical punishment are associated with children's psychological maladjustment, and whether the relationship between punishment and maladjustment disappear after controlling for perceived caretaker acceptance–rejection. The research is based on a proportional, stratified, random sample of 281 Black and White youths (aged 8–18 yrs) in grades 3–12 within the public school system of a poor, biracial county of southeastern Georgia. Results of structural equation modeling suggest that physical punishment is associated with children's psychological maladjustment only if punishment is seen by youths as a form of caretaker rejection. Findings contribute information to an ongoing debate about the relationship between physical punishment and children's psychological adjustment.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the relation of blood pressure (BP) to subsequent decline in cognitive function among persons age 65 or over. Methods: All persons age 65 or over in a geographically defined community were invited to participate in a longitudinal study of problems of the elderly. Interviews were conducted in the participants' homes and included two BP measures and four tests of cognitive function. Follow-up interviews 3 and 6 years after baseline repeated the cognitive function tests. These analyses included 4,284 individuals who had baseline and at least one follow-up measure of cognitive function. The average of 2 scores of the individual cognitive function tests was used as a global measure of cognitive function. Results: In random effects analyses controlling for age, sex, education, and race, there was no significant linear association of either systolic or diastolic BP with 6-year change in global cognitive function score. There was no significant curvilinear association with systolic BP. In tests for a curvilinear association with diastolic BP, there was a suggestion of increased decline among those with low or high diastolic BP (p = 0.03 for the quadratic diastolic term). At baseline, 50% of participants took some type of medication affecting BP. Conclusion: In this community population where BP treatment was common, there was no association of either high systolic or high diastolic BP at the beginning of the observation interval with 6-year cognitive decline.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine whether consumption of different types of fat is associated with age-related change in cognition. Methods: The authors related fat consumption to 6-year change in cognitive function among 2,560 participants of the Chicago Health and Aging Project, ages 65 and older, with no history of heart attack, stroke, or diabetes at baseline. Fat intake was measured by food frequency questionnaire. Cognitive function was measured at baseline and 3-year and 6-year follow-ups, using the average z score of four cognitive tests: the East Boston Tests of Immediate and Delayed Recall, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test. Results: In separate mixed models adjusted for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors and intakes of antioxidant nutrients and other dietary fats, higher intakes of saturated fat (p for trend=0.04) and trans-unsaturated fat (p for trend=0.07) were linearly associated with greater decline in cognitive score over 6 years. These associations became stronger in analyses that eliminated persons whose fat intake changed in recent years or whose baseline cognitive scores were in the lowest 15%. Inverse associations with cognitive decline were observed in these latter restricted analyses for high intake of monounsaturated fat and a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat intake. Intakes of total fat, vegetable and animal fats, and cholesterol were not associated with cognitive change. Conclusion: A diet high in saturated or trans-unsaturated fat or low in nonhydrogenated unsaturated fats may be associated with cognitive decline among older persons.

The editors have compiled a wide variety of chapters that consist of research studies (both qualitative and quantitative), case studies, personal narratives, and conceptual frameworks that speak to biracial women's experiences. The editors contend that the early research and theories regarding biracial identity development doomed biracial people to a life of confusion and problematic identity development. These editors seek to halt the perpetuation of these bleak forecasts and substitute more positive views of healthy biracial identity. Overall, the chapters in this edited volume are very interesting and convey important information regarding a previously largely ignored population. In particular, the personal narratives are effective in providing a context and personal understanding of some of the issues and strengths of biracialism in a culture that values monoracialism. This book supplies a great deal of rich description regarding the issues that biracial women face, it conveys only very basic strategies for counseling and psychotherapy practice.

Abstract = {Little is known about the unique patterns of smoking, risk factors, and correlates of quitting in Black versus White women of child-bearing age. This study examined the relationships among smoking, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and lifestyle variables among 715 women (43.6% Blacks and 56.4% Whites). Stringent inclusion criteria were used for ethnicity, which allows for distinct comparisons but may reduce generalizability of results. Black current smokers smoked fewer cigarettes per day and reported initiating smoking at a later age than Whites. Current versus never smoking was associated with income, education, and caffeine intake. There was a significant ethnicity by alcohol interaction (at lower levels of alcohol intake Whites were more likely to smoke but at higher levels of alcohol there were no ethnic differences). Former smoking versus current smoking was associated with alcohol intake, education, and pack years of smoking. The results of the study suggest several ethnic differences in smoking patterns as well as several correlates of smoking status. These results have implications for the tailoring of interventions and illustrate the association of other health risk factors with smoking status.

Abstract = {Although there is clearly an inverse relationship between smoking and body weight, recent studies suggest that weight attenuation via smoking is slow and may take decades to accrue. This investigation prospectively evaluated the relationships between smoking dosage (or lack thereof) and relative weight change in 1,697 adolescents followed over 4 yrs. A 4 (smoking groups: 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more yrs of smoking exposure)×2 (ethnicity: Caucasian or African American)×2 (gender: male or female) analysis of variance was performed to assess weight gain attenuation associated with increasing exposure to smoking. The overall results reveal a significant 3-way interaction between smoking dosage, gender, and ethnicity. Specifically, smoking initiation was associated with an increase in body mass index for 2 yrs after initiation. For those youth smoking 3 or more yrs, body weights were almost identical compared to never-smokers. No significant reductions in body weight were observed in any gender or ethnic group for up to 3 yrs after smoking initiation. It is concluded that smoking initiation is not associated with adolescent body weight change for at least a 3-yr period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Conventional norms that test presumably normal elderly individuals at one point in time may include preclinical cases of dementia and therefore may be less sensitive to the presence of dementia. A sample of presumably normal African American and White rural community older adults were retested after approximately 4 years to develop robust norms for the Mini Mental State Examination, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale Fuld Object Memory Evaluation, WAIS-R Vocabulary and Block Design, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory and Visual Reproduction, Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices, and Clock Drawing Test. 94 out of the original 133 participants were located and agreed to be retested. 12 of the participants retested showed significant decline on testing relative to their own baseline and were dropped from the recalculated norms. Participants who declined on testing tended to be older, less educated, had lower WAIS-R scores on Vocabulary and Block Design combined, had poorer IADLs and were less socially active. There was no difference in physical health status or level of depression. Recalculated group means showed little change when the participants who declined had been removed, but this left very few participants at the extremes of age (>85 years) and education (<4 years).

Abstract = {Few studies compare Alzheimer disease (AD) incidence among black and white subjects. The objective of this study is to estimate incidence and the effect of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele in these races. A population-based study of disease incidence using a random, stratified sample was done. The study was done in a geographically defined community of 3 adjacent neighborhoods in Chicago, Ill. A total of 6158 persons participated; 4.1 years later, persons initially free of AD were sampled for clinical evaluation for disease incidence. The effect of the APOE ε4 allele on the risk of AD differed strongly for black and white subjects. Among white subjects, the presence of the APOE ε4 allele was associated with a 2.73-fold increase in risk while among black subjects there was no increase in risk. Black race was associated with a nonsignificantly increased risk of AD with an odds ratio of 1.84 if APOE and its interaction with race are considered, and an odds ratio of 1.28 if they are not. The incidence of AD was 1.45% per year among persons 65 to 74 years old, 4.73% among those 75 to 84 years old, and 9.11% among those 85 years and older. Apolipoprotein E ε4 led to increased risk of AD among white subjects but not black subjects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

The present study, which examined participants at an NGHS center when they were 19-23 yrs old, investigates 5 commonly reported chronic pains: back, head, face/jaw, abdomen, and chest. Chronic pain grade (CPG) status based on pain self-reports (frequency, duration, severity, and interference with usual activities) is reported for each of the 5 pain sites. Results show that chronic pain is common in this population of young women, although based on the CPG severity scores, only a small percentage is dysfunctional. Racial differences were not found for back, head, abdomen, or chest pains. However, significant racial differences were found regarding facial pain and symptoms related to TMDs above and beyond socioeconomic status (SES). Not only were facial pain and jaw symptoms reported more frequently by Caucasians compared to African-Americans controlling for SES, they also were reported to have an earlier onset.

Abstract = {Information regarding the prevalence of dizziness and its association with functional disability among African American and White residents from defined community populations is limited. 6,158 persons 65 years and older (78.8% of age-eligible persons) completed in-home interviews that included 3 common measures of self-reported disability: the Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale, the Rosow-Breslau Functional Health Scale, and the Nagi Physical Disability Scale. A stratified random sample of 729 persons underwent a detailed evaluation that included questions on the frequency and severity of dizziness, which was defined as having an episode of dizziness or lightheadedness at least once a month. The overall prevalence of dizziness in this population was 9.6%. It increased with age, from 6.6% in those 65–74 yrs old, to 11.6% in those 75–84 yrs old, and to 18.4% in those persons ≥85 years old. It was more common in women but was not associated with race. After adjusting for age, sex, and race, dizziness was associated with greater disability on the Rosow-Breslau and Nagi measures but not on the Katz ADL Scale. The authors suggest that dizziness is common among older persons and is associated with functional disability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

The literature has been unclear regarding the role that coping mechanisms play in mediating or buffering the effects of stressors, and continued efforts to clarify the role of coping are important in order to inform clinical interventions. The current study was based on the responses of 297 White and African-American gay men (aged 20.1–72 yrs) with and without HIV/AIDS participating in the Chicago Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Coping & Change Study (C&CS) from 1992 to 1994. We found that the amount of detachment- versus involvement-oriented coping strategies used to deal with stressors was unrelated to the level of reported depressed mood and AIDS-specific distress, except among the most severely depressed men (upper 15%), for whom greater reliance on involvement coping strategies was associated with decreased depression. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Data concerning difficulty failing asleep or early morning arousal (insomnia), along with self-reports of physical disability, respiratory symptoms, depressive symptomatology, perceived health status, and use of prescribed sedative medication, were collected and analyzed. Overall, 15% of the participants without symptoms of insomnia at baseline reported chronic difficulty falling asleep or early morning arousal 3 years later in follow-up interviews. African-American women had a significantly higher incidence of insomnia (19%) compared with African- American men (12%) or with white men and women (both 14%). Men were more likely than women to no longer report symptoms at follow-up (64% vs 42%). For both races, the presence of depressed mood was a risk factor for the incidence of insomnia, and the absence of depressed mood was a predictor of remission.

These couples must socialize their children to function in the mainstream while coping as a minority group member. Ethnic socialization refers to the communication of an ethnic identity; the necessity of fostering resilience and adaptive coping mechanisms is critical for caste-bound minorities who must function in a world of ambiguity. Existing literature suggests that self-esteem for African-American children is related to personal support and encouragement in the home, but achievement is related to factors outside family socialization. The balance between majority values and African-American culture struck by the presence of a minority agenda becomes the deciding factor for positive vs negative socialization outcomes and overall mental health.

Abstract = {Cardiovascular responses were examined in a community sample of 128 18–49 yr olds, comprised of 29 male and 29 female African-Americans and 35 male and 35 female Caucasian Americans. Ss completed a battery of laboratory stressors, including mental arithmetic, reaction time (RT), a speech task, and the cold pressor test. In addition to systolic and diastolic blood pressures, the underlying hemodynamic parameters of cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were assessed. Intertask consistency of response was explored in ethnic and gender groups; correlational analyses were conducted separately for each group. For the psychological tasks, unanimously significant coefficients were observed. Intertask consistency between psychological tasks and the cold pressor was considerable but somewhat less impressive (particularly for blood pressure) than that observed among the psychological tasks themselves.

Kamarck et al (1992) in a community sample. 16 White and 14 Black women (aged 25–44 yrs) were administered the protocol twice with a 1-mo retest interval using a mobile laboratory at a community-based testing site. As in previous studies with males, individual differences in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses to the protocol were highly reliable when data were aggregated across 3 tasks and 2 testing sessions. Reliability of cardiac contractility (preejection period) and stroke volume changes to these tasks exceeded .70. This reactivity assessment procedure has now produced reliable results in 3 studies and appears to be exportable across diverse samples and settings.

Four experiments comparing TGT and control treatments are reviewed, involving a total of 558 students in Grades 7–12. Sociometric measures were used to assess TGT effects on the number of cross-racial friendship choices and the percentage of cross-racial choices over all choices made. Chi-square analyses showed significant positive TGT effects on 7 of 13 measures of numbers of cross-racial choices and 3 of 13 on percentage of cross-racial choices over all choices.

The present study investigates the possibility of inducing greater assertiveness and autonomy on the part of Negroes when working with whites. Ss performed a task involving cognitive judgments (items from Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and other nonverbal tests), first individually, then in groups of 2, paired according to race. Some Ss were given a pretrial condition structured to enhance their level of confidence in their own judgment. Judgmental accuracy and influence on the group decision improved in both races with pretrial conditioning; without it Negroes showed the characteristic deference to the opinion of the white partner, and were less accurate.

Ss' knowledge of smoking-associated diseases and diseases not associated with smoking was also assessed. Stepwise regression analysis of composite knowledge scores revealed 4 predictors of the health consequences of smoking: education, race, smoking status, and income. Smokers reported less knowledge and less concern about health consequences of smoking, were more likely to be male, and were more concerned about health consequences of cholesterol. The best predictor of smokers who had never attempted cessation was their greater concern over weight control, compared with smokers with a history of smoking-cessation attempts.

Abstract = {The relation between multiracial identity selection and psychological outcomes related to the self and well-being was explored among minority/White biracials spanning four different mixed-race groups (n = 201): Black/Whites, East Asian/Whites, Latino/Whites, and South Asian/Whites. The mixed-race groups showed considerable variability in their selection of multiracial identity categories and different patterns of identity selection, as well as a higher overall representation of transcendent identity (i.e., identity that challenges traditional notions of race) than reported in previously published studies. Our findings demonstrated that biracial identity selection, especially when differentiating between identities that are socially validated or not socially validated by others, was related to a person's level of multiracial identity integration, identification with Whites, perceived discrimination from Whites and non-Whites, and psychological well-being. Identity selection groups did not significantly differ from each other in levels of self-concept clarity or identification with their non-White racial group. Theoretical implications for extending a multidimensional model to other mixed-race groups and redefining race as a social and cultural construction are discussed.

Abstract = {When it comes to the racial categorization of biracial individuals, do people look at phenotypicality (i.e., a race consistent appearance) for clues, or do they look back at racial ancestry? We manipulated racial ancestry and racial phenotypicality (using morphed photos) to investigate their influence on race categorizations. Results indicated that while ancestry and phenotypicality information both influenced deliberate racial categorization, phenotypicality had a substantially larger effect. We also investigated how these factors influenced perceptions of warmth and competence, and racial discrimination. We found that Black–White biracials with low Black phenotypicality were perceived as warmer and more competent than biracial targets with moderate and high Black phenotypicality. Moreover, given identical instances of racially discriminatory treatment, low Black racial phenotypicality targets were significantly less likely to be perceived as victims of racial discrimination. Our findings shed light on how ancestry and phenotype influence perceptions of race and real world social judgments such as perceptions of discrimination. Previous studies have shown that low minority ancestry biracials are presumed to have experienced less discrimination; our findings indicate that racial cues impact perceptions of discrimination even in incidences of known racial discrimination.

Methods: Using the 2005 Youth Culture Survey data set, we test our theoretical expectations using descriptive statistics and multiple regression models. Results: The relationship between racial identification and out‐group attitudes varies among racial groups; specifically, racial identity variables do not have a significant impact on whites’ out‐group attitudes, but they do matter for blacks and Hispanics. Conclusion: While American society has changed in many ways (i.e., increased number of minorities and more tolerance, or at least more discussion of acceptance, for racial groups), our research finds that race still plays a consequential role in the lives of young racial minorities.

Abstract = {Among emerging adults and college students, racial and ethnic minorities experience greater risk for suicidal ideation and behavior than their White counterparts. Research has identified numerous cognitive risk factors for suicidal ideation. However, they have not been well studied among racial and ethnic minorities. The present study examined the association between these factors (brooding rumination, reflective rumination, hopelessness, and depressive symptoms) and suicidal ideation among 690 Black, Latino, and biracial college students. Among all groups, hopelessness was positively associated with suicidal ideation. Brooding was negatively associated with suicidal ideation, after adjusting for reflection and hopelessness, although only at low levels of depressive symptoms. Black race/ethnicity and Latino race/ethnicity, compared with biracial race/ethnicity, each separately interacted with reflection to predict lower levels of suicidal ideation at moderate to high levels of reflection. Furthermore, Latino race/ethnicity, compared with biracial race/ethnicity, interacted with both reflection and depressive symptoms, such that reflection was negatively associated with suicidal ideation among Latino individuals reporting depressive symptoms above the 39th percentile. Biracial race/ethnicity, compared with monoracial race/ethnicity, also interacted with reflection and depressive symptoms, with reflection associated with greater amounts of suicidal ideation at depressive symptom levels above the 39th percentile. Our findings suggest reflective rumination differentially affects racial and ethnic groups and should be considered in conjunction with depressive symptoms among Latino and biracial individuals in suicide risk assessment and treatment.

Methods: Respondents were randomly assigned to three conditions—a control, a treatment that described the president’s biracial ancestry, and a treatment that combined the biracial ancestry information with a statement that Obama had in fact classified himself as black only. All respondents were then asked how they felt Obama should have filled out his Census form. Results. A clear majority of Americans in all experimental conditions said that Obama should have identified himself as both black and white. Conclusion: There appears to be suggesting robust acceptance of official multiracial identification despite the cultural and legal legacy of the “one drop of blood” rule in official U.S. race categorization. A subsequent survey experiment found that a convenience sample of Americans support multiracial identification for mixed-race individuals generally and not only for the president.

We replicated past findings to demonstrate that after Obama's reelection, White participants reported that our country had made racial progress and decreased their support for equality programs (e.g., affirmative action). Our results also revealed that labeling President Obama as either biracial or Black did not affect views of racial progress. Additionally, Black participants categorized President Obama as Black more than White participants, while White participants categorized President Obama as White more than Black participants. We discuss these results in terms of the impacts of racial beliefs that stem from exposure to a minority leader. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

An historical context is briefly summarized to understand three generational cohorts of mixed-race women's experience in the United States: exotic, vanguard, and biracial baby boomers. Legislative changes have contributed to increased race mixing since the late sixties. Across cohorts, as the construction of race evolves and changes, the interaction between the objectification of female gender and race figures prominently in the struggles to assert identity.

Abstract = {The basic tenet of passing is that multiracial individuals are a subordinate race or ethnic group. It is a concept that began with the rape of enslaved women. Hypodescence, or the 1-drop rule, specified that such offspring were considered Black and therefore should remain enslaved. Many of these offspring, however, passed as White and took on a White identity physically and sometimes psychologically. Passing is still very important in the 21st century, where the term cultural competence has become a buzzword for many. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry defines cultural competence as a “set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies found in a system, agency, or professionals that enables them to work effectively in a context of cultural difference.” Although those in the medical field are getting better at practicing cultural competence, there is the occasional patient who falls below the radar. During my childhood, for example, I was frequently annoyed, and to some degree felt personal discomfort, that strangers assumed I was White when that was only part of how I viewed myself. If I had decided to pass as White, I could have avoided this conflict but would have been confronted by many others. Through openly, and without apology, asking about and discussing racial identification, even in patients who appear 100% White, you can stop these children, like me, from falling below the radar. A simple question on an intake form does not cut it, because a phenotypically White, biracial individual passing as White may identify only as White, for example, causing us to completely misunderstand this patient. We must do better. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Using data from the American Community Survey for the period 2006–2010, this study provides up-to-date demographic information about poverty among American Indians and Alaska Natives. Our analysis investigates both absolute poverty and relative poverty and distinguishes between four racial categories of American Indians and Alaska Natives including single-race American Indian; biracial white and American Indian; biracial black and American Indian; and other multirace American Indian. We also report results for thirty-seven of the largest self-reported tribal affiliations for single-race American Indians. In general, all of the American Indian and Alaska Native groups have higher levels of absolute and relative poverty rates compared to non-Hispanic whites. The problematic character of poverty among American Indian racial groups is underscored by their substantially higher odds of being poor (relative to non-Hispanic whites), even after statistically taking into account age, gender, education, metropolitan status, and region of residence. Significant variation across the thirty-seven tribal groups is evident, however, with single-race American Indians having the highest level of poverty. This variability suggests the need for future research into the various tribal affiliations and tribal economies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Effectively engaging parents has been a continuing challenge for child protection workers. A lack of engagement can lead to significant negative consequences for families. This preliminary study explored the ability of family factors (e.g.; legal involvement, history with child protective services, substance abuse, child placement, intimate partner violence, identifying as Black, Latino or biracial) to predict parent engagement with child welfare services. A four dimensional measure of engagement with child protective services (Yatchmenoff, Res Soc Work Pract 15(2):84–96, 2005) was used which included receptivity, buy-in, working relationship and mistrust. The variables of parental substance abuse, intimate partner violence and identifying as Black, Latino or biracial were significant predictors of all four dimensions of engagement although each dimension was predicted by a unique combination of these factors. Substance abuse positively predicted engagement while intimate partner violence and identifying as Black, Latino or biracial negatively predicted engagement. The implications of these findings for child protection practice are described. Recommendations are made for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Marriage and parenthood are associated with weight gain and residential mobility. Little is known about how obesity-relevant environmental contexts differ according to family structure. We estimated trajectories of neighborhood poverty, population density, and density of fast food restaurants, supermarkets, and commercial and public physical activity facilities for adults from a biracial cohort (CARDIA, n = 4,174, aged 25–50) over 13 years (1992–93 through 2005–06) using latent growth curve analysis. We estimated associations of marriage, parenthood, and race with the observed neighborhood trajectories. Married participants tended to live in neighborhoods with lower poverty, population density, and availability of all types of food and physical activity amenities. Parenthood was similarly but less consistently related to neighborhood characteristics. Marriage and parenthood were more strongly related to neighborhood trajectories in whites (versus blacks), who, in prior studies, exhibit weaker associations between neighborhood characteristics and health. Greater understanding of how interactive family and neighborhood environments contribute to healthy living is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: To examine whether race and poverty (income <125% of the federal poverty limit), modifies associations between diabetes and cognition in a biracial, urban-dwelling sample. Methods: Cross-sectional data for 2066 participants (mean age = 47.6 years, 56.8% women, 56.2% African American, 38.6% below poverty) from the first wave of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study were used for analyses. Eleven tests measured cognitive function. Interactions among diabetes, race, and poverty status with cognition were assessed in multiple regression analyses. Results: Significant interactions among diabetes, race, and poverty status were observed. Among African Americans below poverty, diabetic individuals performed lower than nondiabetic individuals on California Verbal Learning Test Free Recall Short Delay (z = −0.444 [0.123] versus z = −0.137 [0.045]) and Long Delay (z = −0.299 [0.123] versus z = −0.130 [0.045]), Digit Span Backward (z = −0.347 [0.109] versus z = −0.072 [0.041]), and the Brief Test of Attention (z = −0.452 [−0.099] versus z = −0.099 [0.047]), and higher on Category Fluency (z = 0.114 [0.117] versus z = −0.118 [0.044]). No consistent differences between diabetic and nondiabetic individuals were found for African American and white participants above poverty. Conclusions: Diabetes was associated with poorer verbal memory, working memory, and attention among African Americans living in poverty. Diabetic African Americans below poverty may have increased risk of cognitive deficit at a younger age. Improving health literacy, doctor-patient communication, and multidisciplinary medical care for impoverished individuals may reduce differences. Additional research is needed to clarify mechanisms underlying these associations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Homeless youth have particular need to develop inner resources to confront the stress, abusive environment of street life, and the paucity of external resources. Research suggests that treatment supporting spiritual awareness and growth may create a foundation for coping, relationships, and negotiating styles to mitigate distress. The current pilot study tests the feasibility, acceptability, and helpfulness of an interpersonal spiritual group psychotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) integrated with spiritual visualization (SV), offered through a homeless shelter, toward improving interpersonal coping and ameliorating symptoms of depression, distress, and anxiety in homeless youth. An exploratory pilot of integrative group psychotherapy (IPT + SV) for homeless young adults was conducted in a New York City on the residential floor of a shelter-based transitional living program. Thirteen young adult men (mean age 20.3 years, SD = 1.06) participated in a weekly evening psychotherapy group (55 % African-American, 18 % biracial, 18 % Hispanic, 9 % Caucasian). Measures of psychological functioning were assessed at pre-intervention and post-intervention using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, GAD-7), and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32). A semi-structured exit interview and a treatment satisfaction questionnaire were also employed to assess acceptability following treatment. Among homeless young adults to participate in the group treatment, significant decreases in symptoms of general distress and depression were found between baseline and termination of treatment, and at the level of a trend, improvement in overall interpersonal functioning and levels of general anxiety. High utilization and treatment satisfaction showed the intervention to be both feasible and acceptable. Offered as an adjunct to the services-as-usual model at homeless shelters serving young adults, interpersonal psychotherapy with spiritual visualization (IPT + SV) in group appears to be a feasible and potentially useful treatment option for promoting improved mental health.

Abstract = {Objective: To compare infant race/ethnicity based on birth certificates with parent report of infant race/ethnicity in a survey. Data Sources: The 2007 Oklahoma birth certificates and SEED for Oklahoma Kids baseline survey. Study Design: Using sensitivity scores and positive predictive values, we examined consistency of infant race/ethnicity across two data sources (N = 2,663). Data Collection/Extraction Methods: We compared conventional measures of infant race/ethnicity from birth certificate and survey data. We also tested alternative measures that allow biracial classification, determined from parental information on the infant's birth certificate or parental survey report. Principal Findings: Sensitivity of conventional measures is highest for whites and African Americans and lowest for Hispanics; positive predictive value is highest for Hispanics and African Americans and lowest for American Indians. Alternative measures improve values among whites but yield mostly low values among minority and biracial groups. Conclusions: Health disparities research should consider the source and validity of infant race/ethnicity data when creating sampling frames or designing studies that target infants by race/ethnicity. The common practice of assigning the maternal race/ethnicity as infant race/ethnicity should continue to be challenged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Purpose of the study: Investigating health disparities requires studies designed to recruit and retain racially and socioeconomically diverse cohorts. It is critical to address the barriers that disproportionately affect participation in clinical research by minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This study sought to identify and rectify these barriers to recruit and retain a biracial (African American and non-Hispanic White) and socioeconomically diverse cohort for a longitudinal study. Design and Method: The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study is a 20-year longitudinal examination of how race and socioeconomic status influence the development of age-related health disparities. One goal was to create a multifactorial recruitment and retention strategy. The recruitment paradigm targeted known barriers and identified those unique to the study's urban environment. The retention paradigm mirrored the recruitment plan but was based on specifically developed approaches. Results: This cohort recruitment required attention to developing community partnerships, designing the research study to meet the study hypotheses and to provide benefit to participants, providing a safe community-based site for the research and creating didactics to develop staff cultural proficiency. These efforts facilitated study implementation and enhanced recruitment resulting in accrual of a biracial and socioeconomically diverse cohort of 3,722 participants. Implications: Recruiting and retaining minority or poor research participants is challenging but possible. The essential facets include clear communication of the research hypothesis, focus on providing a direct benefit for participants, and selection of a hypothesis that is directly relevant to the community studied.

Abstract = {Objective: The present study characterizes the relationship between report of stroke symptoms (SS) or TIA and incident cognitive impairment in the large biracial cohort of the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. Methods: The REGARDS Study is a population-based, biracial, longitudinal cohort study that has enrolled 30,239 participants from the United States. Exclusion of those with baseline cognitive impairment, stroke before enrollment, or incomplete data resulted in a sample size of 23,830. Participants reported SS/TIA on the Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-free Status at baseline and every 6 months during follow-up. Incident cognitive impairment was detected using the Six-item Screener, which was administered annually. Results: Logistic regression found significant association between report of SS/TIA and subsequent incident cognitive impairment. Among white participants, the odds ratio for incident cognitive impairment was 2.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.81, 2.39) for those reporting at least one SS/TIA compared with those reporting no SS/TIA. Among black participants, the odds ratio was 1.66 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 1.89) using the same modeling. The magnitude of impact was largest among those with fewer traditional stroke risk factors, particularly among white participants. Conclusions: Report of SS/TIA showed a strong association with incident cognitive impairment and supports the use of the Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-free Status as a quick, low-cost instrument to screen for people at increased risk of cognitive decline.

Abstract = {Objective: Our objective was to examine the link between smoking and smoking history, including smoking intensity and cessation, overall and by race, in a biracial prospective cohort study. Methods: A subset of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study participants (n = 972, 49% black) completed brainMRI scans twice (1993–1995 and 2004–2006). We defined white matter hyperintensity (WMH) progression as an increase of ≥2 points on the 9-point Cardiovascular Health Study scale across scans. Participants reported information on smoking behavior at the baseline MRI and at 2 prior study visits, approximately 3 and 6 years before baseline. We used adjusted logistic regression to evaluate the association between smoking variables and WMH progression in the total sample and separately by race (black and white). Results: We found WMH progression in 23% of participants (30% of black participants, 17% of white participants). Overall, being a current smoker 6 years before baseline was associated with WMH progression. In race-stratified analyses, we found adverse associations with smoking status at multiple time points and persistent smoking in white but not in black participants. However, we found no statistical support for effect modification by race for most of these analyses. Increasing pack-years of smoking was associated with greater risk of WMH progression, while time since quitting and age at smoking initiation were not associated with WMH progression, with little indication of differences in these associations by race. Conclusions: Our findings concur with previous studies suggesting a relationship between smoking and WMH progression, and further demonstrate a dose-dependent association.

Abstract = {Genetic moderation of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) efficacy for economically disadvantaged women with major depressive disorder was examined. Specifically, we investigated whether genotypic variation in corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) and the linked polymorphic region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) moderated effects of IPT on depressive symptoms over time. We also tested genotype moderation of IPT mechanisms on social adjustment and perceived stress. Non-treatment-seeking urban women at or below the poverty level with infants were recruited from the community (N = 126; M age = 25.33 years, SD = 4.99; 54.0% African American, 22.2% Caucasian, and 23.8% Hispanic/biracial) and randomized to individual IPT or Enhanced Community Standard groups. The results revealed that changes in depressive symptoms over time depended on both intervention group and genotypes (5-HTTLPR and CRHR1). Moreover, multiple-group path analysis indicated that IPT improved depressive symptoms, increased social adjustment, and decreased perceived stress at posttreatment among women with the 0 copies of the CRHR1 TAT haplotype only. Finally, improved social adjustment at postintervention significantly mediated the effect of IPT on reduced depressive symptoms at 8 months postintervention for women with 0 copies of the TAT haplotype only. Post hoc analyses of 5-HTTLPR were indicative of differential susceptibility, albeit among African American women (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Abstract Aim Children and adolescents with bipolar parents have an elevated risk for anxiety disorders. However, antidepressant medications commonly used to treat symptoms of anxiety may accelerate the onset of mania in these already at‐risk youth. Therefore, studies evaluating innovative non‐pharmacologic treatments for anxiety in this population are urgently needed. Methods Subjects participated in 12 weekly sessions of mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy for children (MBCT‐C), a manualized group psychotherapeutic intervention utilizing cognitive behavioural principles and mindfulness exercises to increase regulation of attention and non‐judgmental acceptance of present moment thoughts, emotions and experiences. Independent raters administered symptoms rating scales prior to each treatment session. Spearman correlations and paired‐samples signed rank tests were used to examine outcomes. After‐intervention surveys and session transcripts were reviewed to assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results Participants included 10 youth (meanage = 13.2; 80% girls; 40% biracial) with generalized, social and/or separation anxiety disorders, and a parent with bipolar disorder. Clinician‐rated anxiety was significantly reduced after intervention (meanbefore = 11.1; meanafter = 4.3; P < 0.01), as well as youth‐rated trait anxiety (P = 0.03). Parent‐rated emotion regulation significantly increased from before to after intervention (P = 0.05). Increases in mindfulness were associated with decreases in anxiety (P = 0.03). Finally, children and parents/guardians reported high levels of feasibility, acceptability and usefulness of the intervention.

Abstract = {The idea that the Latino/a community is one, large, monolithic group has pretty much been dispelled from mainstream media and thought. The growing political power of Latino/a voters highlights the differences—by region, country of origin, race—within our community. Add that to the waves of Latino Diaspora, which has transported families to areas of the country where Latinos/as had seldom ventured, the realities of "growing up" Latino/a in the United States are increasingly complex. In most urban areas, you can walk into a Latino/a market or listen to Spanish-language radio that caters to Mexican, Dominican, Salvadoran, and Ecuadorian palates and audiences. This diversity within the Latino/a community and the development of a Pan-Latino/a consciousness is our future. Our chapter is one such exploration of what we call "multiple Latino/a identities" and how these shape—and are shaped by—diversity within the Latino community. There are four "voices" represented here. Three of us are women and one is a man. Two are biracial, all of us represent multiples cultures. Two of us were raised (mostly) on the east coast, one on the west coast, and one not in the contiguous United States. Our individual paths have been tricky and complex. For this chapter we sat around a virtual table—and one real one—to talk our stories, laugh, commiserate, authorize, and strengthen each other. This charla is a beginning.

Abstract = {Within the Asian American narrative, one part that is regularly excluded is the story of mixed race Asian Americans. Despite the fact that mixed race Asians, also known as Hapas, make up 15% of the Asian American community and are one of the largest subgroups according to Pew Research Center, they have not been given an equal place in cultural organizations, community leadership, and academic research. According to Beverly Yuen Thompson (2000), "Within the 'Asian American experience' there is a great deal of diversity that has thus far remained unexplored. Issues of interracial relationships, transracial adoptions, biracial identity, and queer identity have remained marginalized and considered exceptions to an unspoken norm of Asian American identity". Since Asian Americans are defined by a monolithic term and are viewed by American society as a single entity, any deviations from this normative definition have been excluded. For many Hapa students in college, their cultural and racial differences have resulted in a general exclusion from Asian American and other single-race groups and harsher criticism under the model minority myth (MMM). Through a single, in-depth vignette, our chapter examines the influence of this exclusion and how the MMM operates to hamper student confidence and opportunities to connect with other students on campus, ultimately eroding the quality of the college experience. Additionally, it attempts to shine a light on the mixed race Asian American community and to make a case for why these stories are important in the overall landscape of educational research on Asian Americans and other non-dominant minority groups in general. A discussion of implications and recommendations for greater awareness and sensitivity to mixed-race students and their development in student programming and services as well as questions for further reflection follow. The following question guided our overall inquiry and analysis: What are the stories—perceived and experienced challenges—of those who identify as Hapa during college?

Abstract = {Background: Dietary antioxidants can inhibit reactions accompanying neurodegeneration and thus prevent cognitive impairment. We describe associations of dietary antioxidants with cognitive function in a large biracial population, while testing moderation by sex, race, and age and mediation by depressive symptoms. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 1274 adults (541 men and 733 women) aged 30 to 64 years at baseline (mean [standard deviation] = 47.5 [9.3]) in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Lifespan Study, Baltimore city, MD. Cognitive performance in the domains of memory, language/verbal, attention, spatial, psychomotor speed, executive function, and global mental status were assessed. The 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. Dietary intake was assessed with two 24-hour recalls, estimating daily consumption of total carotenoids and vitamins A, C, and E per 1000 kcal. Results: Among key findings, 1 standard deviation (È2.02 mg/1000 kcal) higher vitamin E was associated with a higher score on verbal memory, immediate recall (β = +0.64 [0.19], p = .001), and better language/verbal fluency performance (β = +0.53 [0.16], p = .001), particularly among the younger age group. Women with higher vitamin E intake (β = +0.68 [0.21], p = .001) had better performance on a psychomotor speed test. The vitamin E-verbal memory association was partially mediated by depressive symptoms (proportion mediated = 13%Y16%). Conclusions: In sum, future cohort studies and dietary interventions should focus on associations of dietary vitamin E with cognitive decline, specifically for domains of verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed.

Abstract = {Although deficits in executive functions have been linked with both depression and rumination in adulthood, the nature of the relationship between these constructs is not well understood and remains understudied in adolescence. The present study examined the relationship of rumination and depression to deficits in executive functions in early adolescence, a critical developmental period for the emergence of depression and rumination and the development of executive functions. Participants were 486 early adolescents (52.7 % female; 47.1 % African American, 48.8 % Caucasian; 4.2 % Biracial/Multiracial/Other; M age = 12.88 years; SD = .62) and their mothers, recruited through local schools. Measures included (a) a semi-structured diagnostic interview of the mother and adolescent, (b) youth self-report forms assessing depressive symptoms and trait rumination, (c) mother-report forms assessing demographic information, and (d) behavioral tests of executive function (sustained, selective and divided attention, attentional set shifting, and working memory). Gender moderated rumination-set shifting associations, such that rumination predicted better set shifting in boys only. The current level of depressive symptoms moderated rumination-sustained attention associations, such that rumination predicted better sustained attention in those with low levels of depressive symptoms and worse sustained attention in those with high levels of depressive symptoms. Rumination did not predict performance on other measures of executive functions. Likewise, depressive symptoms and diagnosis were not associated with executive functions. Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: A newly emergent literature suggests that bisexual men and women face profound health disparities in comparison to both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Additionally, bisexual individuals often experience prejudice, stigma, and discrimination from both gay/lesbian and straight communities, termed "biphobia." However, only limited research exists that empirically tests the extent and predictors of this double discrimination. The Bisexualities: Indiana Attitudes Scale (BIAS) was developed to test associations between biphobia and sexual identity. Methods: Using standard techniques, we developed and administered a scale to a purposive online sample of adults from a wide range of social networking websites. We conducted exploratory factor analysis to refine scales assessing attitudes toward bisexual men and bisexual women, respectively. Using generalized linear modeling, we assessed relationships between BIAS scores and sexual identity, adjusting for covariates. Results: Two separately gendered scales were developed, administered, and refined: BIAS-m (n = 645), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual men, and BIAS-f (n = 631), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual women. Across scales, sexual identity significantly predicted response variance. Lesbian/gay respondents had lower levels of binegative attitudes than their heterosexual counterparts (all p-values < .05); bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their straight counterparts (all p-values < .001); and bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their lesbian/gay counterparts (all p-values < .05).Within racial/ethnic minority respondents, biracial/multiracial status was associated with lower bi-negativity scores (all p-values < .05). Conclusions: This study provides important quantitative support for theories related to biphobia and double discrimination. Our findings provide strong evidence for understanding how stereotypes and stigma may lead to dramatic disparities in depression, anxiety, stress, and other health outcomes among bisexual individuals in comparison to their heterosexual and homosexual counterparts. Our results yield valuable data for informing social awareness and intervention efforts that aim to decrease bi-negative attitudes within both straight and gay/lesbian communities, with the ultimate goal of alleviating health disparities among bisexual men and women.

Abstract = {Exponential increases in multiracial identities, expected over the next century, create a conundrum for perceivers accustomed to classifying people as their own- or other-race. The current research examines how perceivers resolve this dilemma with regard to the own-race bias. The authors hypothesized that perceivers are not motivated to include ambiguous-race individuals in the in-group and therefore have some difficulty remembering these individuals. Both racially ambiguous and other-race faces were misremembered more often than own-race faces (Study 1), though memory for ambiguous faces was improved among perceivers motivated to include biracial individuals in the in-group (Study 2). Racial labels assigned to racially ambiguous faces determined memory for these faces, suggesting that uncertainty provides the motivational context for discounting ambiguous faces in memory (Study 3). Finally, an inclusion motivation fostered cognitive associations between racially ambiguous faces and the in-group. Moreover, the extent to which perceivers associated racially ambiguous faces with the in-group predicted memory for ambiguous faces and accounted for the impact of motivation on memory (Study 4). Thus, memory for biracial individuals seems to involve a flexible person construal process shaped by motivational factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Monoracial and multiracial individuals are likely to have different conceptualizations of race and subsequently different approaches toward racial ambiguity. In particular, monoracial individuals may be more likely to rely on categories when processing ambiguous faces, whereas multiracial individuals may tend to ignore such categorizations due to a reduced tendency to essentialize race. We compared monoracial (White and Asian) and biracial (Asian/White) individuals’ memory patterns. Specifically, we examined participants’ memory for White, Asian, and biracial faces labelled as either White or Asian. Both White and Asian participants relied on the labels, remembering faces labeled as the in-group better than faces labeled as the out-group. Biracial participants relied less on the labels, exhibiting better recognition memory overall. Biracial participants’ memory performance was also highly correlated with a less essentialist view of human traits. This cognitive flexibility may serve an adaptive function for biracial individuals and contribute to enhanced facial recognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Juan sits at the intersection of multiple worlds. He is a gay man and a person of color with working-class roots living in the United States, and his race and sexual orientation certainly have been devalued or denigrated at various points throughout his life. Moreover, as a biracial person, particularly as a child of parents from two different racial minority groups, Juan most likely has been marginalized even within his own racial-ethnic communities, perhaps rendered invisible because he does not "fit" clearly into a specific group, including his own family. These challenges to his identities further may be contextualized within his current developmental, family, and career struggles. Moreover, although gay men, people of color, and biracial and multiracial people are marginalized in the larger society, it is important to view the sources of strength that Juan may derive from these identities. In this chapter, we will discuss counseling issues specific to working with LGB people and biracial and multiracial people, integrating Juan's presenting concerns to provide examples. Because it will be optimal to employ a myriad of culturally responsive theoretical orientations when working with Juan, we have chosen to work from a feminist relational perspective, embedded in LGB affirmative and multicultural competence frameworks. Although all clients can benefit from a feminist relational perspective, we believe this approach to be particularly relevant to Juan, who is facing multiple challenges in part because of his identity as a biracial (Filipino and Black) gay man, perhaps from working-class or working-poor roots. In addition, from what he describes, he is facing challenges in his relationships with family members and perhaps with friends and his partner. In the next sections, we will define our theoretical frameworks applied to the case of Juan. Throughout the chapter, we will integrate relevant information from the evidence-based practice literature in addressing the anxiety symptoms that Juan presents, bearing in mind that there is a dearth of research on how these techniques apply to individuals from nondominant groups.

Abstract = {Background: Early substance use co‐occurs with youths' self‐organization into deviant peer groups in which substance use is central to social interaction. We hypothesized that the social dynamics of deviant peer groups amplify the risk of progressing from early use to later dependence, and that this influence occurs over and above escalations in use that typically accompany early substance use and membership in deviant groups. Methods: Our study used a longitudinal, multimethod dataset consisting of 998 adolescents and their families. Participants were recruited from middle schools in a large metropolitan area in the Pacific Northwest. The sample was 47.3% female and ethnically diverse (42.3% European American, 29.1% African American, and 28.6% other, including biracial). We examined deviant peer clustering as a mediator between early substance use and later dependence, controlling for proximal levels of use, SES, early antisocial behavior, and parental monitoring. Tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use were assessed at ages 12, 13, and 16–17. Past‐year nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana dependence (DSM‐IV) was assessed at age 19. Youth and parent reports and observational data were used to assess deviant peer clustering at age 16–17, and youth reported on antisocial behavior and parental monitoring at ages 12 and 13. Results: Early substance use predicted increased likelihood of dependence on tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana by late adolescence. Deviant peer affiliation mediated these links, even when accounting for proximal levels of substance use. Conclusions: Early substance use not only promotes escalations in use across adolescence but also provides entry into a deviant social context that contributes to increased risk of dependence. Our results emphasize the importance of identifying and intervening in early substance use before it becomes an organizing factor in friendship selection and interaction. Deviant peer clusters are clearly an important avenue for intervention when seeking to interrupt the progression to substance dependence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Previous research has shown that identity integration is likely to lead to enhanced creativity. However, this research was conducted among first‐ and second‐generation immigrants, but not among mixed‐race individuals. The current research examined identity integration and creativity among mixed‐race individuals. We also explored the role of integrated identity experiences at home. We found that identity integration was related to increases in creativity; and this was partly mediated via integrated identity experiences at home. Our findings suggest that positive bicultural experiences at home may create a context for the individual to integrate their biracial identities; and this is ultimately beneficial for creativity.

By logistic regression, significant explanatory variables of Class 3 BMI at age 24 included top decile waist circumference at age 11 (odds ratio (OR) 5.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-13.9, P = 0.0002), age 10 BMI ≥ the Center for Disease Control (CDC) 2000 top 15% (OR 7.0, 95% CI 2.5-19.3, P = 0.0002), and a three-way interaction between race, childhood insulin, and average caloric intake from age 10 to age 19 (for each unit increase, OR 1.7 95% C11.3-2.2, P = 0.0003).

Abstract = {This chapter was co-published simultaneously in Women & Therapy, 2004, Vol. 27, No. 1/2, 119-131. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2004-10574-008[/rid].) As a result of a long history of both forced miscegenation and willing participation in interethnic relations, there now exists a growing group of people who closely identify with a racial or cultural group that is incongruent with their physical appearance. This can occur in one of three ways: (1) when someone is multiracial, and, therefore, not easily placed in a single racial/ethnic category, (2) when one physically resembles a racial/ethnic group other than his or her actual classification, or (3) when a person has acculturated to a racial/ethnic group other than his or her own. This paper addresses therapeutic and social concerns that are likely to emerge when counseling women fitting one of these three categories. To illustrate these factors, four case summaries of women experiencing distress directly and indirectly related to their ethnic/racial self-identification are presented, along with relevant social, interpersonal and emotional concerns.

Abstract = {The two goals of this chapter are to (1) provide an assessment of the current state of knowledge, attitudes, and course practices of family communication educators with respect to African-American culture and, based on these results, (2) begin to lay a foundation upon which to build strategies to increase family communication educators' competence in providing communication instruction both within and across the racial divide. The authors report the results of a survey of 31 family communication educators' knowledge, attitudes, and course practices concerning aspects of African-American culture and family life. Then, the authors use the results of the survey to lay a foundation upon which to build future instructional strategies and research. More specifically, they offer a selected primer of readings concerning African-American culture and family life of relevance to the study of family communication. Results from the survey suggest that family communication education is primarily taught by White educators, teaching mostly White students, using instructional materials that are perceived to not adequately present a culturally diverse picture of communication in families. However, these educators did acknowledge a need for improvement and recognized their need for help. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

The chapter is organized into 3 sections. The first presents a review of relevant literature; the second summarizes the two studies that investigate influences on African-American and European-American adolescents' self-esteem; and the third concludes with a discussion and recommendations for future scholarship and family esteem communication practices. The two studies presented were conducted to examine communication and Black and White adolescent self-esteem. Study 1, with 192 6th & 7th grade African American and 62 6th and 7th grade European-American students, used a quantitative methodology to examine the relative importance of parent and peer communication, racial esteem, and support variables on adolescent self-esteem. Study 2, with 24 8th grade students, their female teacher, and two parents, used qualitative methodology to address some of the questions raised by Study 1. Findings provide insight into how family communication helps to construct the perceptions that Black and White youth have of themselves. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to provide an opportunity for White children in an Iowa community to express their ideas, in general, and to reveal their way of knowing and expressing their understanding of race and culture, in particular. For the purpose of this study, the focus was on the elementary school years and the understandings these children have about "race" and "culture." The issue of racial homogeneity is of concern as well, because of the overwhelmingly White dominance in the community. Ss included 48 2nd-grade, 42 4th-grade, and 39 6th-grade students who participated in an all-class activity that dealt with some aspect of race and culture. The purpose of the activities was to introduce the ideas of race and culture in as nonintrusive a way as possible to the children while, at the same time, to incorporate these concepts into the existing curriculum. Following the in-class discussion children were asked if they would like to participate in an interview with the experimenter. Of the original sample 21 2nd-grade, 21 4th-grade, and 11 6th-grade children participated in group interviews with the experimenter. All 53 interviews were analyzed by using the tripartite method of phenomenology developed by M. Merleau-Ponty (1962). The themes which appeared among each group of children are discussed. Overall, the children expressed their understanding of race and culture by definitions of the words, the family circumstances under which these meanings were learned, and the desired social goals to achieve harmony among people of different races and cultures.

Abstract = {Examines communication between parents and children about racially negative interpersonal encounters. The focus is in episodes of racial derogation for African-American families. Specifically, the investigation considers how African-American parents approach the problem of racial insults and what conditions might account for differences in their family communication about the issue. The primary goal of the study is to generate insights to assist African-American parents in preparing their children to maintain feelings of personal integrity and self-control in the face of these negative experiences. A secondary aim of the analysis is to contribute to understanding the potential effects of parent–child communication about race in all US families. Four nonclinical families, two Black and two White, with children ranging in age between 9 and 14 yrs were interviewed. Interview questions tried to assess the family's media behavior patterns and power, parental roles and authority, multigenerational patterns, and the family's "family myth" (i.e., the most important trait or value that the parents were trying to teach their child). Findings suggest that mass media plays a different role in each family system and that the role is informed by a number of other system patterns.

Abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to explore elements of the complex nature of racism in the US that shape certain African-American familial modes of communication. In the presence of a kitchen stove, even when it is turned off, parents exclaim "No!" as their toddlers inch toward the stove. Because the stove represents significant potential and actual danger that the toddler is unable to discern, the negative imperative is a developmentally appropriate caregiving response. In everyday life, racism functions as a hot stove for African-American children. Given the pervasiveness of racism throughout one's life span, a major caregiving function is to provide early childhood developmental experiences that enable African-American children to make appropriate responses to this hot stove. The hot stove burns relentlessly from birth through death and therefore, it is a fundamental part of the context related to understanding African-American caregivers' early childhood communication with their children.

The variant approach of identity development suggests that individuals of more than one racial background are confronted with a unique set of developmental tasks in order to achieve racial identity. The sport environment may offer a unique context through which racial identity may be developed. A qualitative case study analysis was used to assess the relevance of the variant approach in explaining identity development in a bi-racial athlete. Results revealed partial support for the stages associated with the variant model. Moreover, racial identity is also discussed in relation to sport performance. Some practical recommendations are made for sport psychology practitioners that may encounter bi-racial athletes in their work. Furthermore, suggestions for future research are provided.

There is generally a lack of research/literature on African American relationships and even less research on Black female relationships. Black women in interracial relationships: In search of love and solace describes a qualitative study of Black women designed to address the prevalence of interracial relationships with Black women, how the relationships come about, how others (family, friends, strangers, coworkers) perceive and react to the relationship, and characteristics of these women. The book provides unique insights into Black and biracial women’s desire for interracial relationships, the unique challenges that they face in entering relationships, and the strategies that women engage in to cope with reactions from family, friends, and strangers intrigued by the relationship. This book is a must read for both clinicians and researchers of Black women. Researchers will benefit from the examination of identity development, psychological functioning, and relationship choices. The true strength of this book is its theoretical discussion and interpretation of women’s experiences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of political empowerment on employment opportunities in the private sector for African Americans. It is hypothesized that African Americans' success in capturing local elective office leads to an increase in their employment in the private sector; therefore the biracial (Black-White) differences in employment allocation in the private work force should tend to decrease. The research employs multivariate regressions to evaluate five explanations for biracial dissimilarity in employment in 240 primary metropolitan statistical areas. The findings reveal that the effects of empowerment are considerably less of an influence than expected on improving African Americans’ employment. Viewed in this light, African Americans have been overly optimistic about how political power can improve economic conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In this chapter, we inquire into the part that relationships play in orienting persons to the cultural resources for identity formation. In our research, we consider how young adults with parents of different racial backgrounds come to rewrite their racial identity, becoming biracial, multiracial, or mixed race. We study the personal narratives of biracial youth to understand how they talk about arriving at these new self-identifications. The personal narrative is an attempt to make sense of the self through time (Cohler, 1998) by organizing experience into an understandable story of the past, present, and future (Ricoeur, 1984). Through the workings of plot, the personal narrative configures the me into a story that conveys a sense of identity (McAdams, 1996). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Youth are faced with many stressful interpersonal, contextual, and identify development related challenges that contribute to the increased risk of negative outcomes during adolescence. The current study examined two important factors related to youth’s development and well-being: parent–child attachment and negative body image. Specifically, the current study examined body image as one mechanism responsible for the effect that mother and father attachment has on internalizing symptoms in a sample of low-income, ethnic minority youth. Additionally, differences across gender and ethnic/racial groups were examined. Participants included 140 (71 % female) ages 10–16 at baseline recruited from urban public schools in Chicago with high percentages of low-income students. The current sample was ethnically diverse (41 % African American, 30 % Latino, 16 % European American, 6 % Biracial, 6 % Asian, and 1 % other). Participants completed measures of their relationships with their mothers and fathers, negative body image, and internalizing symptoms across two periods of time separated by approximately 1 year. Results showed that body image mediated the relation between both mother and father attachment and internalizing symptoms. These results were further moderated by race/ethnicity, but not by sex. For African American participants, mother attachment was related to internalizing symptoms through negative body image while for Latinos, paternal attachment was related to internalizing symptoms through negative body image. Although maternal attachment had direct effects on internalizing symptoms for Latinos, negative body image did not mediate this relationship. These results support an integrative model in which interpersonal risk lays the foundation for the development of cognitive risk, which in turn leads to internalizing symptoms for urban youth.

Abstract = {Objective: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common, costly societal problem. Interventions designed to reduce IPV recidivism have had limited success but primary prevention efforts are likely to be more effective in reducing the occurrence of IPV. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a computer-based preventive intervention (ePREP) on IPV in a sample of married, community couples. Method: We employed a randomized clinical trial design comparing ePREP to an active placebo control group. Using a community sample of 52 married couples (21% Black, 3% Asian, 65% White, 7% Latino, 4% Mixed/biracial) who had been married, on average, 4.3 years, we examined the impact ePREP on IPV as measured by self and partner reports of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale. We assessed couples at baseline, six-weeks post-baseline, and one-year post-baseline. We used the Actor Partner Interdependence Model with treatment effects to analyze the obtained dyadic data. Results: We found that ePREP reduced physical and psychological aggression among married couples (on average across informants, a 90% reduction in expected counts of physical aggression, and a 0.18 standard deviation reduction in psychological aggression) and that these gains were maintained at a 1-year follow-up assessment. Conclusions: Interventions that can be delivered widely and at a low-cost will increase the likelihood of reaching those who will benefit most from receiving them. Implications for implementing flexible interventions and changing our approach to treatment delivery are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Most participants had completed high school but few participants (13 %) had completed degrees from 4 year institutions. We used a latent profile approach to identify natural mentoring relationship profiles and employed structural equation modeling to test our study hypotheses. Slightly over half of study participants (53 %) reported the presence of a natural mentor in their lives since the age of 14. Results suggest that natural mentoring relationships characterized by high levels of relational closeness and either extended relationship duration or frequent contact may promote improvements in psychological well-being among mentees over time via greater experiences of social support from important others.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine self-reported weight discrimination and differences based on race, sex, and BMI in a biracial cohort of community-based middle-aged adults. Design and Methods: Participants (3,466, mean age = 50 years, mean BMI = 30 kg/m²) of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study who completed the 25-year examination of this epidemiological investigation in 2010-2011 were reported. The sample included normal weight, overweight, and obese participants. CARDIA participants are distributed into four race–sex groups, with about half being African-American and half White. Participants completed a self-reported measure of weight discrimination. Results: Among overweight/obese participants, weight discrimination was lowest for White men (12.0%) and highest for White women (30.2%). The adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for weight discrimination in those with class 2/3 obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) versus the normal-weight was most pronounced: African American men, 4.59 (1.71-12.34); African American women, 7.82 (3.57-17.13); White men, 6.99 (2.27-21.49); and White women, 18.60 (8.97-38.54). Being overweight (BMI = 25-29.9 kg/m²) vs. normal weight was associated with increased discrimination in White women only: 2.10 (1.11-3.96). Conclusions: Novel evidence for a race–sex interaction on perceived weight discrimination, with White women more likely to report discrimination at all levels of overweight and obesity was provided. Pychosocial mechanisms responsible for these differences deserve exploration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the moderating effect of adolescents’ beliefs about socialization from caregivers (“attributions”) on the link between racial socialization and private regard. This research addresses the paucity of literature on adolescent attributions as a context for the relation between socialization and private regard. The independent roles of racial barrier, racial pride, and self-worth messages were examined. Adolescents’ attributions were defined as beliefs that race-based messages were coming from a parent-child relationship characterized by love, autonomy, and care. Moderation analyses on the sample of 88 African American and biracial youth (ages 11-14 years) revealed that for adolescents who placed more emphasis on a positive relationship quality as the purpose for receiving socialization, self-worth messages were associated with higher private regard. The findings support the importance of attending to adolescents’ attributions for socialization and the impact that it has on fostering positive feelings about being African American.

Abstract = {The current chapter introduces you to the concept of case conceptualization. You will have the opportunity by way of case illustrations and guided exercises to begin experiencing what it means to extract essential data from a client's story and craft those data to provide a succinct view of "what is going on," "how it came about," "what is desired as an alternative experience," and "how best to achieve that alternative." In addition to describing the process of case conceptualization, this chapter provides you with details on the case of Y-Chun, an adult client who is a biracial, nontraditional college student. Y-Chun's case will be used throughout the text. As you will see in the upcoming chapters, experts in a particular theory of counseling will not only explain that theory but also apply it to their understanding, or conceptualization, of the case of Y-Chun. It is our hope that in viewing this single case through the lens of each of the theories to be presented, the theories will take on more life and practical value. Using this one case will provide you with the opportunity to see the unique perspective a counselor takes when employing a particular theory, but it will also begin to highlight the overlapping nature of the varied case conceptualizations across theories.

Abstract = {Stella Martinez, a 10-month-old biracial (African American and Latina) girl, was cold, hungry, and terrified. Wearing nothing but her diaper and swaddled in a thin blanket, she was lying on the sidewalk of a busy street. The ground was hard and uncomfortable, and Stella did not know how long she had been lying there. She watched in terror as her parents yelled, shoved, and hit each other. Her parents, high on methamphetamines, were loud and unpredictable. She had a deep desire to be held and comforted by someone; anyone would do at this point, but she had given up on crying a long time ago. She also had given up on expecting that someone would meet her needs on a predictable basis. All she could hope for was to get something to eat before she fell asleep. She was becoming accustomed to this experience. After all, it had practically been her daily routine since the day she was born. Unbeknownst to Stella, today was a different day. Late on this particular afternoon, when she had finally lost the strength to stay awake and was dozing off, she was jostled awake by a stranger in a dark uniform. She was confused as she witnessed her parents get taken away by other strangers in uniforms. Stella then found herself in a car with these unknown adults, and she spent the evening in a foreign but warm and comfortable room. The next day, she awoke to smiling strangers, her foster parents. She was cleaned, clothed, and fed. For the first time in a long while, Stella's body did not long for food or warmth. She did, however, long for the love and familiarity of her parents. The first few months in her foster home were difficult. The shock of losing her parents and the world to which she had become accustomed was immense, and Stella struggled. Where were her parents? Who were these strangers? Everything that her five senses registered was foreign—from touch to the smells to the tastes, to what she saw and heard. None of it seemed familiar. Stella was overwhelmed and confused. Her whole system wrestled with the yearning for familiarity along with the desire to be loved and cared for in this new way. Over the next several months, Stella seemed to be adjusting. She even began to cry to communicate, gesturing and using words to indicate what she wanted or needed. She learned to seek out her foster mother for comfort and security. She laughed easily but also hid behind her foster mother when she felt scared or unsure. All of these were behaviors that we would expect to see in a child Stella's age. The foster mother was pleased. Despite her difficult and traumatic start, Stella seemed to be settling into a stable and secure relationship with her caregivers. Meanwhile, Stella's birth mother was working to regain custody of Stella. This was an uphill battle, as this mother had lost legal custody of her three older children. Still struggling to remain clean and sober, Stella's mother worked on her case plan and visited with Stella on a weekly basis. The visits were satisfying to neither Stella nor her mother. Stella was confused and terrified and made every attempt to steer clear of her mother. Her mother, appearing annoyed, responded by saying things like, "Don't you love me?" "You're evil," and "I'm your mother, don't you ever forget that, little girl." These visits continued to be very stressful for Stella and her mother. Intervention was necessary if the visits were to continue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Although Barack Obama’s entrance into the 2008 presidential campaign has been warmly received by Whites, Blacks have been somewhat ambivalent. Some even have claimed that Obama is not “Black.” The case of Barack Obama brings to the forefront the prospect of intragroup identity differences that exist among Blacks and the potential importance of a candidate’s racial background in elections. Consequently, the authors ask the following questions: (a) Does the racial background of a political candidate affect Black voters’ support and evaluation of a candidate’s personal attributes (i.e., trust, concern, strength, and qualification)? and (b) Focusing purely on the treatment groups separately (White, biracial, and Black candidates), does Black identity affect Blacks’ support and evaluation of a candidate’s personal attributes? The experimental results of this exploratory study find race does make a difference on candidate support, and Black identity influences the way in which Black respondents perceive White, biracial, and Black candidates. As a result, these findings suggest that differences in how Blacks feel about a candidate will depend on the candidate’s racial background, their own attitudes and beliefs about being Black, and where they fall on various demographic and political measures.

Findings, using in-depth interviews, indicated that the primary socializing agents within the pre-college context strongly influenced racial and sexual labels and whether participants integrated their identities or kept them separate. In addition, distance from significant others, in college, spurred further identity development.

Abstract = {Studies of the effect of air pollution on cognitive health are often limited to populations living near cities that have air monitoring stations. Little is known about whether the estimates from such studies can be generalized to the U.S. population, or whether the relationship differs between urban and rural areas. To address these questions, we used a satellite-derived estimate of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration to determine whether PM2.5 was associated with incident cognitive impairment in a geographically diverse, biracial US cohort of men and women (n = 20,150). A 1-year mean baseline PM2.5 concentration was estimated for each participant, and cognitive status at the most recent follow-up was assessed over the telephone using the Six-Item Screener (SIS) in a subsample that was cognitively intact at baseline. Logistic regression was used to determine whether PM2.5 was related to the odds of incident cognitive impairment. A 10 μg/m³ increase in PM2.5 concentration was not reliably associated with an increased odds of incident impairment, after adjusting for temperature, season, incident stroke, and length of follow-up [OR (95% CI): 1.26 (0.97, 1.64)]. The odds ratio was attenuated towards 1 after adding demographic covariates, behavioral factors, and known comorbidities of cognitive impairment. A 10 μg/m³ increase in PM2.5 concentration was slightly associated with incident impairment in urban areas (1.40 [1.06–1.85]), but this relationship was also attenuated after including additional covariates in the model. Evidence is lacking that the effect of PM2.5 on incident cognitive impairment is robust in a heterogeneous US cohort, even in urban areas.

Abstract = {Originally published in Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books, 2004, Vol 49(2), 205-207. Reviews the book "Beyond Black: Biracial Identity in America" by Kerry Ann Rockquemore and David L. Brunsma (covered in its original form in record [rid]2001-05356-000[/rid]). In their new book-length study on (Black-White) biracial identity the authors highlight the reference group categories used by (Black-White) biracial college students, when speaking about and classifying themselves. They present a detailed and lengthy discussion of four biracial identity options: (a) border identity, (b) singular identity, (c) protean identity, and (d) transcendent identity. The reviewer cites problems with the book including: Appendix F reveals a 102-item survey that was completed by 177 biracial college students; this survey is pregnant with items and scales that tap a broad range of issues, and the reader develops the expectation that somewhere along the line, each identity category will be linked to, or represented as, a unique configuration of attitudes, perceptions, and opinions. This never happens, because the major focus of the book is a discussion of how physical appearance "drives" identity self-categorization, especially when biracials are interacting with the "other." Instead of appearance in a narrow sense, the authors seem to have collected data on one's social presentation of self. Additionally, the authors report no correlation between skin tone and type of identity selected, but an implied correlation is suggested (other than percentages, documentation is not provided) between appearance and identity choice.

Abstract = {In a country whose cultural orientation is built around sharp divisions marked by the polar opposite colors black and white, people who combine these two groups have struggled to assert their identities. Black and white people are pitted against one another, portrayed as being in opposition visually and culturally. While the group generally called biracial is a complex territory to explore both psychologically and culturally, there are also long-standing groups, referred to historically as triracial isolates, whose heritage blends the two groups with the addition of various Native American nations. This chapter explores the historic and contemporary issues involved with triracial and biracial American ancestry. It will also examine such occurrences abroad, pointing to the "Stolen Generation" of Australia and the noble families of Europe. Finally, this chapter will assist readers in their search for ancestry. Woven throughout are the psychological issues raised by the assertion of biracial or triracial identity, as opposed to homogenous cultural identification as black, white, or Native American. The prejudice from dominant racial groups because of homogenous identifications is discussed along with suggestions for healing and moving forward while keeping multiracial identity intact.

Gillem and Thompson state that their aim is "to increase our understanding of biracial women, to help us incorporate multiple components of their identities, and to illuminate the impact of the contexts in which their identities develop" (p. 4). Their ultimate hope is that the book "will serve to illuminate the multitude of issues relevant to doing therapy with biracial women and stimulate conversations and further research that will lead to a more complete understanding of their needs and how best to serve them" (p. 4). The volume includes an introductory chapter and 15 quite varied and diverse chapters; six are empirical, eight are theoretical-clinical, and one is a personal narrative. The reviewer concludes that overall this book is a treasure trove of up-to-date information and references for students and scholars who want to learn about or conduct research on biracial women, and it is replete with key clinical issues and critical therapeutic recommendations for clinicians who will work with biracial female clients. With regard to therapeutic orientation, in a number of chapters, narrative-constructivist approaches to therapy are recommended, as are approaches that honor feminist and multicultural principles.

Abstract = {The author shares not only her experiences growing up as a biracial lesbian Samoan/Mexican American, but also how those experiences led her to become a social activist. Being queer, biracial, and a feminist (or as the author identifies: a woman who actively works toward "letting people have it" for their multiple levels of ignorance and hate) in a world that silences, threatens, and incarcerates those who are different, the author felt the three strikes initiative was perfect for describing her place. Most know the three strikes initiative as a legal way to unjustly imprison poor men and women of color for life. In the act of disrupting this horrifying legal practice of three strikes, the author has chosen to present each of these strikes in a different way: (1) Her strike of pride; she challenges family loyalties for being Mexican and Samoan. (2) Her strike of resistance; she challenges sexist and homophobic practices as a woman in sexist Chicano organizations. (3) Her strike of liberation; she challenges the heterosexual life that her family members, friends, and fellow activists have expected her to live. It is with each of these strikes that she now challenges multiple notions of ignorance, disrupts multiple levels of comfort, and creates a safe and consistent space.

Abstract = {The author uses contemporary psychoanalytic theory in further understanding the negotiation of conflict and dissociation in biracial patients who are both African-American and White. Drawing on the work of contemporary theorists who have made efforts to navigate the relationship between inner and outer worlds in our understanding of race from a psychoanalytic perspective, the author examines the relationship between race, culture, and internalized self-other relations—how they interact with each other and impact splitting and dissociative processes among self-states. The author argues for a notion of the unconscious as one that contains historical trauma related to race relations that influences the developing capacity to sustain internal conflict between opposing self-states borne out of this trauma. The author shows how society works against the integration of racialized self-states and interferes with the capacity to contain conflict. Through an extended clinical vignette from an analysis of a mixed-race patient, the author looks at the interplay of self-states between a White analyst (author) and a mixed-race patient (African-American and White) as manifested through a series of enactments and the unconscious “mating” between dissociated self-states in both patient and analyst. The author argues that the analyst's engagement of his or her own dissociated self-states and containment of internal conflict is critical to aiding the patient in moving toward greater integration.

Abstract = {Introduction: Initial research on older smokers suggests that a subgroup of smokers with higher levels of psychological distress and health problems may be more likely to quit smoking than older smokers with fewer such problems. The present study, based on prospective data from a biracial sample of older adults (N = 4,162), examined characteristics of older adult smokers by race and gender. Methods: The present study uses both cross-sectional and prospective data to examine the association between smoking behavior, smoking cessation, health functioning, and psychological distress in a biracial sample of community-dwelling older adults. Results: We found baseline psychological distress to be associated with poor health functioning. Consistent with hypotheses, baseline (Time 1) psychological distress predicted smoking cessation 3 years later (Time 2). Moreover, the change in health problems between Time 1 and Time 2 fully mediated the association between Time 1 distress and smoking cessation. Discussion: Smoking cessation behavior of older adults is best explained by higher levels of distress and health problems regardless of race or gender. These findings may have important treatment implications regarding smoking cessation programs among older adults. Older adult smokers with higher levels of psychological distress and health problems may be more motivated to quit smoking than those with fewer such problems. These difficulties should be targeted within the context of the smoking cessation protocol. Also, we identified a subgroup of older smokers who are reporting fairly good health and lower levels of distress and who are less likely to quit smoking. Motivational methods may need to be developed to engage this group in smoking cessation treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Two studies examined the consequences of this identity denial. In Study 1, mixed-race participants reported that their biracial or multiracial identity caused tension in a variety of contexts. Study 2 focused on one often-mentioned situation: completing a demographic questionnaire in which only one racial background can be specified. Relative to mixed-race participants who were permitted to choose multiple races, those compelled to choose only one showed lower subsequent motivation and self-esteem. These studies demonstrate the negative consequences of constraining mixed-race individuals’ expression of their chosen racial identity.

Abstract = {A church-based health promotion program of the United Methodist Church was implemented to address the holistic health of adults 50 years and older (n = 142). African American congregation members (n = 65) were paired with white congregation members (n = 77) for a total of 12 groups. Over a year, biracial groups participated in weekly two-hour meetings. A one-group pretest-posttest design was used to determine impacts on participants’ religiosity, spirituality, and social support; and if impacts varied by race. At follow-up, program components were assessed. Tangible social support overall improved, and participants experienced meaningful socialization, spiritual opportunities, and improved perceptions of other race groups.

To this end, the relationships between skin color satisfaction, body dissatisfaction, and self-esteem were examined in a sample of 328 women of African descent. Results revealed a significant effect for ethnicity and employment status on body dissatisfaction, skin color satisfaction, and self-esteem.

Abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study is to examine whether physical disability is associated with faster rate of decline in cognitive function. Methods: A longitudinal population-based cohort of 6,678 initially nondisabled older adults from a biracial urban community was interviewed at 3-year intervals from 1993 to 2012. Cognitive function was assessed using a standardized global cognitive score, and physical disabilities using activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Results: During the follow-up period, 2,450 of 6,678 participants (37%) developed ADL and 2,069 of 4,287 participants (48%) developed IADL disability. After adjusting for demographic and physiologic confounders, cognitive function declined a mean of 0.048 unit per year before ADL disability and 0.047 unit per year before IADL disability. In comparison, the rate of cognitive decline accelerated further by 0.076 unit per year (156% increase) after ADL disability and 0.054 unit per year (115% increase) after IADL disability. Severity of ADL and IADL disabilities were also associated with faster cognitive decline following disability. Conclusions: In old age, cognitive function declines substantially faster following physical disability even after controlling for demographic and physiologic characteristics of participants.

Abstract = {In this study, we examine whether a nine-lesson sex education intervention, “Get Real: Comprehensive Sex Education That Works,” implemented in sixth grade, can reduce the number of adolescents who might otherwise become “early starters” of sexual activity (defined as heterosexual intercourse) by seventh grade. Participants were 548 boys and 675 girls who completed surveys in both sixth grade (baseline) and seventh grade (follow-up). The sample was 35% Latino, 32% Black, 24% White, 3% Asian, and 6% biracial. Students randomly assigned to the control condition were 30% more likely to initiate sex by follow-up when controlling for having had sex by sixth grade, demographic variables, and a tendency to give socially desirable responses. This finding is noteworthy because previous research has identified early starters to be prone to poor outcomes in sexual health, family formation, economic security, and incarceration and few middle school interventions have shown an effect on behavioral outcomes.

Results revealed that high levels of peer association and extrinsic rewards from peer relationships best predicted violence among all groups. Furthermore, among Hispanics, positive peer attitudes toward delinquency significantly contributed to violence. Among Caucasians, greater time spent with peers was associated with higher levels of violence. For African Americans, tangible rewards from peer relationships significantly contributed to violence. No significant results were found among biracial/multiracial female offenders. The findings from this study highlight the significant influence of peer relationships on violence among juvenile offenders and suggest the need for further research on racial and ethnic differences.

Abstract = {In this editorial, we provide two case examples from our research—one with Black–White biracial adoptees in White families and the other with Afghan refugee women—to illustrate the challenges that Morales, a feminist poet, posed and how we use intersectionality to analyze and understand women as multidimensional, yet uniquely whole. Theories of intersectionality emerged from the writings of women of color during the 1960s and 1970s. Intersectionality has also been used as a tool for gender and economic justice. In recognizing the limitations of theorizing gender as a unified collective transcending race and class, intersectionality calls on scholars to be more inclusive of a broader group of women in their analysis of gender and definitions of what is feminist. In an increasingly global world in which the challenges to our analysis of oppression and privilege grow geometrically, we must attend with the greatest care to the lenses through which we view the complexity of the lived experiences of those we would call sister and of all we would embrace within the family of humanity.

Abstract = {Currently, four big “Indian” names circulate within lesbian public culture within the United States: the biracial Indian-Dutch actress Janina Gavankar, the biracial model and actress Lisa Ray, Indian-American actress Sheetal Sheth, and Purva Bedi. These actresses have all represented a certain kind of close-to-Whiteness and a carefully constructed “feminine” aesthetic that has much to do with disciplining the racial body as it does the gendered body. In addition, they also position themselves in problematic ways with respect to their racial and sexual identities. What are the consequences of such representation for “real-life” “third-world” lesbians living in Western cultures like the United States in which racist and imperialist gestures constantly frame preemptive meanings about our bodies and our selves? If the only images of third-world lesbians we see are those that are carefully constructed along the same racist and heteronormative ideals of femininity, can racially marked lesbians find accurate models for our own invisible lives? How do these representations affect our perception of ourselves—as women who are lesbian and as women who are not White? How does our “femininity” get positioned within this? Are we the exoticized Other equally available for consumption by hetero and queer Whiteness? How might this only repeat rather than correct imperialist histories of race? How might they further divide communities of color from each other by their problematic selectivity of who gets to represent the racial and sexual Other?

Abstract = {This study demonstrates that experience and development interact to influence the "cross-race effect." In a multination study (n = 245), Caucasian children and adults of European ancestry living in the United States, Norway, or South Africa, as well as biracial (Caucasian-African American) children and adults living in the United States, were tested for recognition of Asian, African, and Caucasian faces. Regardless of national or biracial background, 8- to 10-year-olds, 12- to 14-year-olds, and adults recognized own-race faces more accurately than other-race faces, and did so to a similar extent, whereas 5- to 7-year-olds recognized all face types equally well. This same developmental pattern emerged for biracial children and adults. Thus, early meaningful exposure did not substantially alter the developmental trajectory. During young childhood, developmental influences on face processing operate on a system sufficiently plastic to preclude, under certain conditions, the cross-race effect.

Cooley's Looking-glass Self Theory was used as our theoretical framework. Cooley argued that in the same way we look into a mirror to discover our appearance, we see ourselves through the eyes of other people. Therefore, other people's reactions largely influence the way we see ourselves. This hypothesis was supported by our focus group data; all respondents regarded themselves as Biethnic only after others pointed it out to them. Our results were in some ways similar to existing Biracial identity models. We, too, found that there were multiple responses to being Biracial. We called them: Unique Me, Model Biethnic, and Just Let Me Be Japanese. Like other researchers, we also found that various factors were influential in shaping Biracial identity. Ethnicity of the non-Japanese parent, family structure, and living environment seemed to have largely shaped our respondents' experiences.

Abstract = {Background: There are racial health disparities in many conditions for which oxidative stress is hypothesized to be a precursor. These include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and premature aging. Small clinical studies suggest that psychological stress may increase oxidative stress. However, confirmation of this association in epidemiological studies has been limited by homogenous populations and unmeasured potential confounders. Purpose: We tested the cross-sectional association between self-reported racial discrimination and red blood cell (RBC) oxidative stress in a biracial, socioeconomically heterogeneous population with well-measured confounders. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a consecutive series of 629 participants enrolled in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. Conducted by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, HANDLS is a prospective epidemiological study of a socioeconomically diverse cohort of 3,721 Whites and African Americans aged 30–64 years. Racial discrimination was based on self-report. RBC oxidative stress was measured by fluorescent heme degradation products. Potential confounders were age, smoking status, obesity, and C-reactive protein. Results: Participants had a mean age of 49 years (SD = 9.27). In multivariable linear regression models, racial discrimination was significantly associated with RBC oxidative stress (Beta = 0.55, P < 0.05) after adjustment for age, smoking, C-reactive protein level, and obesity. When stratified by race, discrimination was not associated with RBC oxidative stress in Whites but was associated significantly for African Americans (Beta = 0.36, P < 0.05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that there may be identifiable cellular pathways by which racial discrimination amplifies cardiovascular and other age-related disease risks.

Abstract = {The quest for self-identity has been more complex for African-Americans than for all the groups in American society. This quest has been especially troubling for children where one parent is African-American and the other parent is White. The scholarly literature is replete with themes on Black identity and self-esteem, but this literature does not speak to the issue of biraciality since societal attitudes decree that any person with a "drop of black blood" is Black. There is a move afoot by biracial (Black and White) young adult children to claim both parts of their ethnic heritage. This paper suggests that the issue of biracial identity must be revisited and reexamined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this project was to evaluate a water safety curriculum in a low-income, minority-focused, urban youth summer camp. The curriculum is available to Safe Kids Coalitions across the country; however, it has not previously been evaluated. Methods: Participants were pre-K to third-grade students (n = 166). Children watched a video and received the curriculum in a classroom setting. Each child was given a pre-, post-, and 3-week retention exam to assess knowledge change. Mean test scores and number of safety rules participants could list were analyzed using paired Student’s t tests. Parents were given a baseline survey at the beginning (n = 140) and end of the week-long curriculum (n = 118). Results: The participants were 50% male, 27.5% Hispanic, 68.7% African American, and 3.8% biracial. Children were divided into three groups: pre-K/kindergarten, first and second grade, and third grade. Children in each of the groups received higher knowledge scores at the posttest (p = .0097, p < .0001, and p < .0001, respectively), with little decline in scores at the 3-week retention exam. Similar results were seen for the ability to list safety rules, though the number fell slightly between the posttest and retention test. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that children possessed more knowledge of water safety after receiving this curriculum. This knowledge increase was maintained through the 3-week retention exam. Further evaluation of the curriculum’s content and its impact on water safety beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors are needed, as well as evaluation of additional settings, risk areas, and the role of parental involvement.

Abstract = {The background of this article is that assessment and quantification of skin color is important to health care; color is one indicator of overall health and is linked to oxygenation, tissue perfusion, nutritional status, and injury. The purpose is to describe how skin color varies across racial/ethnic groups so that the information can be applied to clinical practice. The method used is cross-sectional, descriptive design (n = 257). We recorded self-defined race/ethnicity and used a spectrophotometer to measure skin color at two anatomic sites. Skin color variables included L* (light/dark), a* (red/green), and b* (yellow/blue). As regards results, we found significant differences in L*, a*, and b* values by site and race/ethnicity in White, Asian, and Biracial participants. L*: F(3, 233) = 139.04, p < .01 and F(3, 233) = 118.47, p < .01. Black participants had significantly lower mean L* values and wider ranges of L*, a*, and b* as compared with other groups. In regard to application, these findings suggest that clinicians and researchers should plan and provide care based on skin color, rather than race/ethnicity.

Abstract = {Many concerns exist for multiracial children with regard to their racial identity development. These factors are even more complex in a culturally insensitive environment, such as a school. This incident relates the case of a young boy whose identity development journey led him to be inappropriately diagnosed. The expert respondents offer insight into appropriate intervention using reality theory and systemic consultation. "Gerald Collins," a 10-year-old biracial child whose mother was Caucasian and whose father was African American, lived in a predominantly African American community. Gerald was an only child. His mother was a homemaker, and his father was in the Army Reserves. The family had lived in the community for 2 years. In the neighborhood, there were two other bicultural families. Each of the families had one biracial child who had at least two other single-race siblings. Gerald's school was racially mixed, with African American students accounting for approximately 50% of the student population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Maintaining cognitive function protects older adults from developing functional decline. This study aims to identify the neuroimaging correlates of maintenance of higher global cognition as measured by the Modified Mini Mental State Test (3MS) score. Methods: Repeated 3MS measures from 1997–98 through 2006–07 and magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion tensor in 2006–07 were obtained in a biracial cohort of 258 adults free from dementia (mean age 82.9 years, 56% women, 42% blacks). Participants were classified as having shown either maintenance (3MS slope > 0) or decline (3MS slope < 1 SD below the mean) of cognition using linear mixed models. Measures of interest were white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHv) from total brain, volume of the gray matter (GMv) and microstructure (mean diffusivity, MD) for total brain and for brain areas known to be related to memory and executive control function: medial temporal area (hippocampus, parahippocampus and entorhinal cortex), cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex. Results: Differences between cognitive maintainers (n = 153) and non-maintainers (n = 107) were significant for GMv of the medial temporal area (35.8%, p=0.004) and lower MD of the cingulate cortex (37.9%, p = 0.008), but not for other neuroimaging markers. In multivariable regression models adjusted for age, race, WMHv and GMV from the total brain and vascular conditions, each standard deviation of GMv of the medial temporal area and each standard deviation of MD of the cingulate cortex were associated with a nearly 4 times greater probability (odds ratio [standard deviation]: 3.80 [1.16, 12.44]) and a 34% lower probability (0.66, [0.46, 0.97]) of maintaining cognitive function, respectively. In these models neither WMHv nor GMv from total brain were significantly associated with probability of maintaining cognitive function. Conclusions: Preserving the volume of the medial temporal area and the microstructure of the cingulate cortex may contribute to maintaining cognitive function late in life.

Abstract = {Objective: The primary purpose of this study was to test a relatively efficient strategy for enhancing the capacity of juvenile drug courts (JDC) to reduce youth substance use and criminal behavior by incorporating components of evidence-based treatments into their existing services. Method: Six JDCs were randomized to a condition in which therapists were trained to deliver contingency management in combination with family engagement strategies (CM-FAM) or to continue their usual services (US). Participants included 104 juvenile offenders (average age = 15.4 years; 83% male; 57% White, 40% African American, 3% Biracial). Eighty-six percent of the youths met criteria for at least 1 substance use disorder, and co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses were highly prevalent. Biological and self-report measures of substance use and self-reported delinquency were assessed from baseline through 9 months postrecruitment. Results: CM-FAM was significantly more effective than US at reducing marijuana use, based on urine drug screens, and at reducing both crimes against persons and property offenses. Such favorable outcomes, however, were not observed for the self-report measure of substance use. Although some variation in outcomes was observed between courts, the outcomes were not moderated by demographic characteristics or co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: The findings suggest that JDC practices can be enhanced to improve outcomes for participating juvenile offenders. A vehicle for promoting such enhancements might pertain to the development and implementation of program certification standards that support the use of evidence-based interventions by JDCs. Such standards have been fundamental to the successful transport of evidence-based treatments of juvenile offenders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Vitamin D deficiency is a re-emerging epidemic, especially in minority populations. Vitamin D is crucial not only for bone health but for proper brain development and functioning. Low levels of vitamin D are associated with depression, seasonal affective disorder, and schizophrenia in adults, but little is known about vitamin D and mental health in the pediatric population. Methods: One hundred four adolescents presenting for acute mental health treatment over a 16-month period were assessed for vitamin D status and the relationship of 25-OH vitamin D levels to severity of illness, defined by presence of psychotic features. Results: Vitamin D deficiency (25-OH D levels < 20 ng/ml) was present in 34%; vitamin D insufficiency (25-OH D levels 20–30 ng/ml) was present in 38%, with a remaining 28% in the normal range. Adolescents with psychotic features had lower vitamin D levels (20.4 ng/ml vs. 24.7 ng/ml; p = 0.04, 1 df). The association for vitamin D deficiency and psychotic features was substantial (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.4-8.9; p < 0.009). Race was independently associated with vitamin D deficiency and independently associated with psychosis for those who were Asian or biracial vs. white (OR = 3.8; 95% CI 1.1-13.4; p < 0.04). Race was no longer associated with psychosis when the results were adjusted for vitamin D level. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are both highly prevalent in adolescents with severe mental illness. The preliminary associations between vitamin D deficiency and presence of psychotic features warrant further investigation as to whether vitamin D deficiency is a mediator of illness severity, result of illness severity, or both. Higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency but no greater risk of psychosis in African Americans, if confirmed, may have special implications for health disparity and treatment outcome research.

Abstract = {This study examines the role of one component of emotion regulation, behavioral control, in the growth of children’s early behavior problems by examining whether increases in parental positive behavior support brought about by a family-centered intervention were associated with greater child behavioral control, and whether greater behavioral control at age 3 mediated the association between improvements in aspects of positive behavior support from ages 2 to 3 and decreases in growth of behavior problems from ages 2 to 4. The sample included 713 at-risk children (50% female) and their primary caregivers (50% European American, 28% African American, 13% biracial, 9% other) who were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Children had a mean age of 29.91 months at the initial assessment. Data were collected through home visits at child ages 2 to 4, which involved questionnaires for primary caregivers and structured and unstructured play activities for children with primary and alternative caregivers and siblings. Results indicated that the intervention improved parental positive behavior support and reduced growth of child behavior problems. One dimension of positive behavior support, proactive parenting, was modestly associated with behavioral control at age 3, which in turn was significantly associated with growth in behavior problems from ages 2 to 4, with greater behavioral control related to lower levels of growth in behavior problems. Results provide support for the notion that proactive parenting is an important factor in the development of children’s behavioral control and that behavioral control plays an important role in the growth of behavior problems.

Abstract = {Purpose: (1) To identify and compare rates of body mass index (BMI) ≥ 85% (overweight/ obesity) and BMI ≥ 95% (obesity) in maltreated versus comparison young adolescents; (2) to determine whether demographic/psychological characteristics are related to high BMI; (3) to determine whether type of maltreatment is related to high BMI in maltreated young adolescents. Methods: We compared a sample of maltreated young adolescents to a comparison sample of adolescents from the same neighborhood. The maltreated sample (n = 303) of young adolescents (ages 9–12) came from referrals from the county child welfare department in Los Angeles, CA from new cases of maltreatment opened in specified zip codes. A comparison sample (n = 151) was recruited from the same zip codes. The total sample (both maltreated and comparison) was 77% Black or Hispanic and 23% White or biracial with 53% males and 47% females. A stepwise logistic regression was used to examine predictors of high BMI with demographic/psychological covariates and maltreatment group. The maltreated young adolescents were selected and the logistic model included all covariates as well as an interaction between gender and each maltreatment type (neglect, sexual, and physical abuse). Results: Maltreated young adolescents were similar to comparison adolescents in obesity prevalence (27.1% and 34.4%, respectively), although comparison young adolescents were 1.7 times more likely to have overweight/obesity than the maltreated young adolescents (95% CI = 1.13–2.76). No demographic variables predicted high BMI. For the comparison young adolescents, depression slightly increased the odds of overweight/obesity (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01–1.15). Being neglected reduced the odds of being in the overweight/obesity and obesity group when combining genders. For females, but not males, sexual and physical abuse slightly reduced the odds of obesity. Conclusions: Both the maltreated and comparison young adolescents had a high prevalence of overweight and obesity, which puts them at risk for health problems. Maltreatment reduced the odds of having a high BMI for adolescents in this study, which is opposite to research in adults. Further exploration of the mechanism of how maltreatment is related to weight as adolescents age, with specific emphasis on differences between genders, is needed.

Abstract = {Understanding the perception of multiracial persons is increasingly important in today's diverse society. The present research investigated the process of categorizing multiracial persons as “Multiracial.” We hypothesized that perceivers would make fewer Multiracial categorizations of multiracials and that these categorizations would take longer than monoracial categorizations. We found support for these hypotheses across six experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrated that perceivers did not categorize morphed Black–White faces as Multiracial with the same frequency with which they categorized Black and White faces as Black and White (respectively), and that categorizations of multiracials as Multiracial took longer than monoracial categorizations. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these effects to real Black–White faces. Experiment 3 showed that these findings generalized to Asian–White faces. We used pixel variance analysis to show that these effects were not due to increased variance among Multiracial faces. The image analysis showed that the Black–White morphs and real biracials were actually less varied than either the Black or White sets of faces. Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrated that cognitive load and time constraints detrimentally affected multiracial, but not monoracial, categorizations. Experiment 6 showed that imbuing monoracial categories with importance decreases the use of the Multiracial category. Implications of these findings for understanding perceptions of multiracial persons are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The goals of this chapter are to examine the exploration of ethnic and racial identity issues beyond adolescence among minority group members. There is wide variation in the extent of ethnic identity exploration during the transition to adulthood, depending on aspects of both the individual and the context. This chapter focuses on ethnic identity exploration in the American context and specifically on ethnic and racial minorities within that context. I consider individual processes and characteristics that influence ethnic identity exploration and the contextual factors that shape the course of such exploration during emerging adulthood. For convenience, I use the term ethnic identity to encompass three aspects of group identity processes: ethnic heritage, racial phenotype, and cultural background. Although these three aspects of group identity can be distinguished conceptually and have different implications for the individual (Alipuria, 2002), they often overlap as individuals strive to construct a coherent sense of self as group members. However, I use separate terms when discussing research that explicitly focuses on one or another aspect. I begin with a summary of the development of ethnic identity before and during adolescence and then examine this process following adolescence in a variety of contexts and for individuals with a range of group identity challenges, such as being bicultural or being biracial.

Abstract = {The United States (USA) has long led the world in the adoption of children from other countries, with over 300,000 adopted in the last 30 years. Given this magnitude of foreign-born adopted children living in the United States, it is not surprising that academic works have focused on the adjustment, development, and well-being of these children and their adoptive families. Missing from this academic canon, however, are the experiences of adoptive parents, birthparents, and adoptees that comprise a smaller subset of USA adoptions known as outgoing cases . This official Department of State descriptor covers those intercountry adoptions, in which USA children, mostly Black and Biracial infants are adopted by citizens of Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other countries. The USA, with respect to intercountry adoption, is both a receiving and a sending nation. Indeed, from 2003 to 2009, nearly 1,500 USA-born children were adopted by foreign nationals in 14 countries. This chapter outlines some of the issues surrounding outgoing adoptions, provides an overview of the process and ends with a brief discussion of an exploratory qualitative research study conducted by the author with USA and Canadian adoption professionals involved with these adoption cases over time. The discussion is framed within the context of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption (HCIA) and the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000, and is focused on USA infant adoptions to convention countries.

Abstract = {African American males experience poor academic performance, high absenteeism at school, and are at increased risk of being involved in violence than other racial groups. Given that the educational outlook for African American males appears bleak, it is important to assess the aspirations of these adolescent males in order to find the gap between aspirations and educational attainment. In order to promote positive development within this population, it is essential that factors that affect African American males be identified. A survey was administered to male students attending elementary, middle, and high schools in a local school district. A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the career and educational aspirations of African American males. A total of 473 males were surveyed: 45% African American, 22% Caucasian, 13% biracial, and 19% Other (including Asian American, Hispanic, Native American). The results revealed that African American males aspired to attend college at the same rate as other ethnic groups. Also, African American males were more likely to aspire to be professional athletes than males from other ethnic groups. Important factors to consider when designing a program are discussed as well as future research and limitations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Stress is known to amplify the link between pubertal timing and psychopathology. However, few studies have examined the role of peer stress as a context for this link. The present study examined the interaction between perceived pubertal timing and peer stress on symptoms of psychopathology in early adolescence. The sample consisted of 264 students (63% female; Mage=12.40, SD=1.00; 55% Caucasian, 23% African American, 7% Latino, 11% biracial and 4% other). Higher peer stress was associated with symptoms of anxiety/depression; this effect did not vary by timing or gender. However, early-maturing girls with high peer stress demonstrated higher rates of relational and overt aggression compared to other girls. Findings also suggested that late-maturing boys with high stress are at risk for aggression problems; however, due to the small number of boys, analyses were exploratory. Overall, results suggest that developmentally salient contexts as indicated by stressful peer experiences may pose unique threats to early maturing girls and possibly late-maturing boys.

Abstract = {We use incidence data from the 1980 Census and 2008 American Community Survey to track recent trends in interracial marriage. Intermarriage with Whites increased rapidly among Blacks but stalled among Asians and American Indians. Black–White intermarriage increased threefold over 1980–2008, independent of changing socioeconomic status, suggesting declining social distance between Blacks and Whites. Marriages between the U.S.‐ and foreign‐born populations also grew rapidly. Marriages to immigrants increased fivefold among U.S.‐born Asian women and doubled among U.S.‐born Latinas since 1980. Out‐marriage to Whites also was higher among self‐identified biracial than monoracial individuals, but these differences were smallest among Blacks. Interracial couples were overrepresented among cohabiting couples. Finally, log‐linear models provide evidence of growing racial exogamy, but only after adjusting for changing demographic opportunities for intermarriage. Marriages between U.S.‐ and foreign‐born coethnics have been driven by new immigration while slowing the upward trajectory of interracial marriage in America.

In the original article, there is a typographical error in the third paragraph of the Discussion section. On page 1280, in the right-hand column, second paragraph, the fourth sentence should read "In a British cohort where mandatory folate fortification is not in place, a comprehensive set of vitamin B12 markers were examined in association with brain atrophy over 5 years in 107 older adults".] Objective: To investigate the interrelations of serum vitamin B12 markers with brain volumes, cerebral infarcts, and performance in different cognitive domains in a biracial population sample cross-sectionally. Methods: In 121 community-dwelling participants of the Chicago Health and Aging Project, serum markers of vitamin B12 status were related to summary measures of neuropsychological tests of 5 cognitive domains and brain MRI measures obtained on average 4.6 years later among 121 older adults. Results: Concentrations of all vitamin B12–related markers, but not serum vitamin B12 itself, were associated with global cognitive function and with total brain volume. Methylmalonate levels were associated with poorer episodic memory and perceptual speed, and cystathionine and 2-methylcitrate with poorer episodic and semantic memory. Homocysteine concentrations were associated with decreased total brain volume. The homocysteine-global cognition effect was modified and no longer statistically significant with adjustment for white matter volume or cerebral infarcts. The methylmalonate-global cognition effect was modified and no longer significant with adjustment for total brain volume. Conclusions: Methylmalonate, a specific marker of B12 deficiency, may affect cognition by reducing total brain volume whereas the effect of homocysteine (nonspecific to vitamin B12 deficiency) on cognitive performance may be mediated through increased white matter hyperintensity and cerebral infarcts. Vitamin B12 status may affect the brain through multiple mechanisms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate associations between vascular risk factors and changes in burden of infarcts, ventricular size (VS), sulcal widening (SW), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in an initially middle-aged, biracial cohort from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Methods: Initial brain magnetic resonance (MR) scans and evaluations for vascular risk factors were performed in 1,812 ARIC participants in 1994–1995. In 2004–2006, 1,130 ARIC participants underwent repeat MR scans. MR scans were rated using a validated 9-point scale for VS, SW, and WMH. Infarcts were recorded. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations between vascular risk factors and change between MR scans of one or more grades in VS, SW, WMH, or appearance of new infarcts, controlling for age, sex, and race. Results: At baseline, the 1,112 participants with usable scans (385 black women, 200 black men, 304 white women, 223 white men) had a mean age of 61.7 ± 4.3 years. In adjusted models, diabetes at baseline was associated with incident infarcts (odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29–2.95) and worsening SW (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.36–3.24). Hypertension at baseline was associated with incident infarcts (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.23–2.42). In subjects with the highest tertile of fasting blood sugar and systolic blood pressure at baseline, the risk of incident infarcts was 3.68 times higher (95% CI 1.89–7.19) than those in the lowest tertile for both. Conclusion: Both atrophic and ischemic imaging changes were driven by altered glycemic and blood pressure control beginning in midlife. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: Few studies have explicitly tested whether the health disadvantage among older Blacks is consistent across the entire range of education. We examined racial differences in the cross-sectional association of education with physical and cognitive function performance in older adults. Methods: Participants included over 9,500 Blacks and Whites, aged ≥65 years, from the Chicago Health and Aging Project {64% Black, 60% women, mean age=73.0 (standard deviation [SD]=6.9), mean education=12.2 (SD=3.5)}. Physical function was assessed using 3 physical performance tests, and cognitive function was assessed with 4 performance- based tests; composite measures were created and used in analyses. Results: In multiple regression models that controlled for age. age-squared, sex, and race, and their interactions, Whites and those with higher education (>12 years) performed significantly better on both functional health measures. The association of education with each indicator of functional health was similar in older Blacks and Whites with low levels (≤12 years) of education. However, at higher levels of education, there was a significantly more positive association between years of education and these functional health outcomes among Blacks than Whites. Discussion: Results from this biracial population-based sample in the Midwest suggest that Blacks may enjoy greater returns in functional health for additional education beyond high school.

Abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. This study was designed to explore sexual risk among MSM using community-based participatory research (CBPR). An academic–community partnership conducted nine focus groups with 88 MSM. Participants self-identified as African American/Black (n = 28), Hispanic/Latino (n = 33), White (n = 21), and biracial/ethnic (n = 6). The mean age was 27 years (range = 18-60 years). Grounded theory was used. Twelve themes related to HIV risk emerged, including low knowledge of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, particularly among Latino MSM and MSM who use the Internet for sexual networking; stereotyping of African American MSM as sexually “dominant” and Latino MSM as less likely to be HIV infected; and the eroticization of “barebacking.” Twelve intervention approaches also were identified, including developing culturally congruent programming using community-identified assets, harnessing social media used by informal networks of MSM, and promoting protection within the context of intimate relationships. A community forum was held to develop recommendations and move these themes to action. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In May of 2008 the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute issued a report that questioned whether or not transracial adoption is truly in the best interest of the child, thus newly igniting the controversy over transracial adoption. While the research on this controversial topic is substantial, most studies (including those cited in the Donaldson Report) are limited in their scope. Drawing from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with middle-class young black adults, this study offers a broader perspective on transracial adoption by focusing on a range of parent/child race relationships in a class context. The impact of racialized family structure on black identity development is examined by comparing the experiences of young black adults raised in families with two black parents (monoracial), one white and one black parent (biracial), and two white parents (transracial). This article also addresses a void in the literature by focusing on the impact socioeconomic class has on identity formation, particularly middle-class black identity. Results indicate that the formative experiences of young black adults who differ in terms of racialized family structure but share a class status are largely similar. These similarities challenge a number of assumptions that have been made in prior transracial adoption research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Social scientists have become increasingly interested in the racial identification choices of multiracial individuals, partly as a result of the federal government’s new “check all that apply” method of racial identification. However, the majority of work to date has narrowly defined the population of multiracial individuals as the “biracial” children of single-race parents. In this article, we use the open-ended ancestry questions on the 1990 and 2000 5% samples of the US Census to identify a multiracial population that is potentially broader in its understanding of multiraciality. Relative to other studies, we find stronger historical continuity in the patterns of hypodescent and hyperdescent for part-black and part-American Indian ancestry individuals respectively, while we find that multiple-race identification is the modal category for those of part-Asian ancestry. We interpret this as evidence of a new, more flexible classification regime for groups rooted in more recent immigration. Our results suggest that future work on multiracial identification must pay closer attention to the varied histories of specific multiracial ancestry groups.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationships of race, sex, adiposity, adipokines, and physical activity to telomere length in adolescents. Study design: Leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio) was assessed cross-sectionally in 667 adolescents (aged 14-18 years; 48% African-Americans; 51% girls) using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Generalized estimating equations analyses were performed. Results: Telomere length was greater in the African-American adolescents than in the Caucasian adolescents (age- and sex-adjusted T/S ratio ± SE, 1.32 ± 0.01 vs 1.27 ± 0.01: P = .014) and greater in girls than in boys (age- and race-adjusted T/S ratio ± SE, 1.31 ± 0.01 vs 1.27 ± 0.01; P = .007). None of the adiposity or adipokine measures explained a significant proportion of the variance in telomere length. Vigorous physical activity was positively associated with telomere length (adjusted R² = 0.019; P = .009) and accounted for 1.9% of the total variance only in girls. Conclusions: This study, conducted in a biracial adolescent cohort, demonstrated that (1) race and sex differences in telomere length have already emerged during adolescence; (2) adiposity and adipokines are not associated with telomere length at this age; and (3) the antiaging effect of vigorous physical activity may begin in youth, especially in girls.

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between cancer-specific beliefs and survival among men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer. Methods: Based on data from a biracial cohort monitored for mortality for up to 15 years, we investigated the association between beliefs and survival among 251 men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1987 and 1990. We examined patients’ beliefs related to efficacy of regular checkups for detection, potential negative treatment effects, and perceived curability of cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables, medical care measures, clinical factors, and lifestyle. Results: In a fully adjusted model, not believing that most cancers can be cured was associated with an increased risk of death from any cause (Hazard Ratio = 1.62; 95% confidence interval = 1.11, 2.38). Beliefs regarding the efficacy of checkups or potential negative treatment effects were not associated with survival. Conclusions: Prostate cancer patients who reported not believing that most cancers are curable experienced poorer survival after adjusting for a wide array of prognostic factors and potential confounders. Future research to identify underlying behavioral (medical protocol adherence, lifestyle) and physiological (immune and endocrine regulation) mechanisms of this association would translate into improved intervention strategies for cancer survivors.

'Real Women Have Curves' is a feature film in which Ana—an academically gifted, 18-year-old, first-generation Mexican American—experiences conflict with her more traditional, working-class parents. Instructors may use this film to facilitate understanding of Hispanic/ Latina/o Americans via experiential role-plays. The purpose of this activity is to assist students to develop multiple cultural explanations for behaviors and experiences sometimes encountered by Hispanic/Latina/o Americans. The activity also provides opportunities for participants to explore how identities intersect and to examine their own cultural assumptions and values. As a result of this activity students will be able to (a) demonstrate culturally based explanations of behavior and experiences from the perspective of dominant European American culture and Latina/o cultures, (b) understand the impact of multiple identities and stages of identity development on one's own cultural experiences, (c) identify their own cultural assumptions and values, and (d) articulate implications for counseling.

Abstract = {This activity is specifically designed for graduate students studying in the counseling and mental health field (including, but not limited to, the expressive therapies, psychology, counseling, human health services, and social work). The purpose of this experiential exercise is to expand students' awareness of discrimination; increase student's ability to be compassionate and empathic toward individuals with disabilities and "differences"; increase students' ability to observe and reflect on their own biases, prejudices, and stereotypic thoughts; increase students' ability to understand how societal discrimination and prejudice may affect an individual (and create barriers and limitations); and increase students' awareness of barriers (psychological, physical, societal) to individuals' obtaining support and culturally effective psychotherapy. The activity aims to provide participants with opportunities to explore the effect of prejudice, oppression, and stereotyping on their professional development. This activity also enhances participants' compassion for differences. Guided imagery is a powerful tool, and in this exercise it is used to help students increase empathy for others by "stepping into their shoes" momentarily. I have used this experiential exercise with a variety of populations and settings, including college classrooms (both undergraduate and graduate level), corporate settings, small and large companies, counseling agencies, and municipalities. Unlike didactic or lecture-type workshops, which provide information, this workshop is experiential in nature. As cited in the Handbook of College Teaching: Theory and Application, experiential learning provides more active learning and self-exploration and increases participants' sense of ownership of learned material. With increased ownership comes greater likelihood of students' internalizing and actually using what they learn outside of class. We can never really know how another person feels or thinks. However, through this exercise, students are challenged to imagine how another person might experience life and, it is hoped, to draw inward and outward toward inquiry. As a result of this exercise, students will (a) increase their awareness of their own prejudices, (b) increase their sensitivity to the impact of societal prejudice on potential clients, (c) increase their awareness of creating a culturally sensitive counseling environment (through use of language, written material, and so forth), and (d) use guided imagery to increase their empathy for others who are different from themselves.

Abstract = {This exercise can be used successfully with graduate counselor trainees in multicultural counseling classes or career counseling classes; practicing career counselors, psychologists, and therapists in a workshop format; or undergraduate students in career life-planning or freshman-year-experience classes or other self-reflective classes. The purpose of this activity is to facilitate participants in identifying significant aspects of their cultural and life identities and in understanding the role that those identities play in their relationships and decisions. When used with counselors and counselor trainees, the exercise may be oriented toward developing an understanding of how their identities influence their interactions, assumptions, and values related to working with clients. When used with clients in career counseling, this exercise can be oriented toward developing an understanding of how their identities may influence their choices in careers, jobs, or time allocation. It can be used to help them consider rebalancing their distribution of efforts depending on their significant identities. In addition, it can be used to help them understand how these identities interact with the identities of those around them and how this interaction may influence family and work relationships. It is preferable to use the exercise in situations where participants can be in dyads because the interaction between two people optimizes the outcome. By the end of this exercise, participants will be able to identify eight significant aspects of their identity and be able to talk about each; understand how another individual's identity structure may differ from their own; describe how their identity may influence the way they interact with others' identities and how their significant identities may fluctuate as a result of their interactions with others; and recognize how their significant identities may influence their choices, such as career, job, and relationships, and discover how their time and energy allocations may need to shift to realign with their significant identities. This activity is relevant to the following topics: Cultural Identity Development; Dimensions of Worldviews; Cross-Cultural Family Counseling; Human Growth and Development; Career Development; Helping Relationships; Multiple Identities/Biracial, Multiracial; Creative Arts.

Abstract = {This activity is designed for counseling students in graduate training programs. It is especially useful to implement during the early stage of graduate students' training program, perhaps during their first semester. This activity is intended to serve a threefold purpose. First, it is aimed at increasing counseling students' self-awareness of how their own development has been affected by multiple factors that comprise the RESPECTFUL counseling model. Second, this activity is aimed at increasing counseling students' knowledge of the cultural multidimensionality of their clients' development. Third, it is designed to assist counselors in thinking about the strengths and potential barriers they bring to counseling situations with persons from diverse groups and backgrounds; these strengths and potential barriers are a result of their own cultural conditioning and life experiences. As a result of completing this activity, students will (a) develop a better understanding of their own cultural multidimensionality and identity; (b) become more knowledgeable of the personal, cultural, and developmental strengths they bring to counseling settings; (c) expand their thinking about their clients' cultural multidimensionality; and (d) increase their awareness of the potential limitations and biases that are linked to their own personal, cultural, and professional development as it affects the work they do.

Abstract = {This activity is designed for undergraduate and graduate students as well as professionals. Stereotypes remain prevalent in today's society, despite great efforts to eliminate them. In many ways, stereotypes can be harmful in nature as they perpetuate often incorrect notions and ignore individual differences. Even more damaging are the potential negative psychological effects on members of stereotyped groups. This activity has four purposes: (a) to provide a process that will welcome participants to experience the powerful ways in which stereotypes may impact behavior, affect, and cognition; (b) to highlight the ideology that all people possess multiple social identities; (c) to help participants understand and appreciate the visible and invisible aspects of diversity within the group; and (d) to help participants identify ways in which stereotypes and bias, both implicit and explicit, can serve as barriers to the psychotherapeutic relationship. As a result of this activity, participants will (a) increase their awareness and knowledge that both prejudice and discrimination come in a variety of forms; (b) have concrete and in-vivo examples of how people's behavior, affect, and cognition are impacted in powerful ways by stereotypes; (c) appreciate and understand that all people benefit from cultural diversity training; and (d) identify personal biases that serve as barriers to interpersonal cross-cultural encounters.

Abstract = {This activity is designed for graduate students in the fields of counseling, psychology, social work, and the helping professions in general. When working with counselors and students, it is a common belief that we must look beyond the color of one's skin. It seems comfortable to believe that a color-blind approach is easy to use when working with students. Yet when we ignore a person's racial background, we ignore who they are. Counselors who are White may ignore their own racial identity because they are part of the dominant White culture. As part of the dominant White culture in America, there are systems of privilege at work that provide advantages to the dominant White cultural and structural group. At the same time, students of color are asked to close off their racial identity and are excluded from the power differentials within systems of privilege that White cultural groups experience. Therefore, it is only when students feel a connection with their counselors or teachers—when students believe they are recognized, respected, and valued—that counselors and educators are in a position to make a positive difference in students' lives. The purpose of the activity is to introduce a discussion about how a color-blind approach is unconsciously chosen because it is easy to ignore someone's race. When we ignore a person's racial background, we ignore who they are. The activity compels one to examine how structural aspects of racism promote inequity. As a result of this activity, participants will be able to (a) deconstruct how the identification of race is easily ignored; (b) critically examine how a color-blind approach is often chosen because of one's own privileged White cultural position; (c) reflect on power, privilege, and dominance in a broader U.S. society; and (d) define how race is a social construction of U.S. society.

Abstract = {This activity is suitable for students in various disciplines, including counselor education. It is a versatile for all types of diversity-related training. Prejudice, bias, and stereotypes occur insidiously and are often outside the awareness of individuals. The purpose of this activity is to provide an opportunity for the participants to empathically understand individuals who are marginalized in society and to recognize how the participants themselves may inadvertently contribute to the status quo. This activity is aimed at expanding multicultural counseling competencies as it relates to awareness, knowledge, and skills. Participants will explore a baseline definition of diversity and will be actively involved in reformulating this definition throughout the session or sessions. Participants will explore self-identity and the influences of identity formation. Participants will become aware of their prejudices, biases, and stereotypes regarding individuals who may be different from themselves with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), sexual orientation, abilities, religious/spiritual beliefs, and so forth. Participants will enhance their awareness of how individuals who are marginalized in society by virtue of their race, ethnicity, gender, SES, sexual orientation, abilities, or religious and spiritual beliefs may self-identify. Participants will imaginatively transpose themselves temporarily into the phenomenological world of individuals who are marginalized in society because of race, ethnicity, gender, SES, sexual orientation, abilities, or religious/spiritual beliefs with the goal of giving them the opportunity to empathically understand the everyday reality of an individual who is marginalized.

Abstract = {Objective: The expanding overweight and obesity epidemic notwithstanding, little is known about their long-term effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The main objective of this study was to investigate whether overweight (body mass index (BMI) 25 to <30 kgm−2) and obese (BMI ≥30 kgm−2) young adults have poorer HRQoL 20 years later. Methods: We studied 3014 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a longitudinal, community-dwelling, biracial cohort from four cities. BMI was measured at baseline and 20 years later. HRQoL was assessed by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores of the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey at year 20. Higher PCS or MCS scores indicate better HRQoL. Results: Mean year 20 PCS score was 52.2 for normal weight participants at baseline, 50.3 for overweight and 46.4 for obese (P-trend <0.001). This relation persisted after adjustment for baseline demographics, general health, and physical and behavioral risk factors and after further adjustment for 20-year changes in risk factors. No association was observed for MCS scores (P-trend 0.43). Conclusion: Overweight and obesity in early adulthood are adversely associated with self-reported physical HRQoL, but not mental HRQoL 20 years later.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Black fathers: An invisible presence in America (2nd ed.) edited by Michael E. Connor and Joseph L. White (see record [rid]2011-09034-000[/rid]). In this book, Connor and White attempt to shed light on some current and historical factors that contribute to the plight that African American fathers now encounter. In addition to providing historical context for many of the challenges facing African American fathers, Black fathers also includes several chapters in which various contributors describe their relationships with their fathers. This inclusion is especially helpful because not all of the accounts provided by these writers are sanguine. As a clinically trained psychologist, the reviewer was glad to see the addition of therapeutic strategies for working with African American adolescents. The chapters addressing successful approaches with African American men are insightful and provide the reader with excellent sources. However, the text is not without its shortcomings. Although Connor and White state in the preface that “no attempt was made to cover all types of fathers” (p. x), conspicuously absent from the discussion of Black fathers is any chapter on fathers of biracial children. Many readers of Black fathers will find the text a very easy read. Most prospective audiences (e.g., psychologists, social workers, graduate students) will find the information contained in the book enlightening. However, for those persons who have been culturally encapsulated, the text may not completely serve its educative purpose. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Cognitive models of panic disorder suggest that change in catastrophic misinterpretations of bodily sensations will predict symptom reduction. To examine change processes, we used a repeated measures design to evaluate whether the trajectory of change in misinterpretations over the course of 12-week cognitive behavior therapy is related to the trajectory of change in a variety of panic-relevant outcomes. Method: Participants had a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (N = 43; 70% female; mean age = 40.14 years). Race or ethnicity was reported as 91% Caucasian, 5% African American, 2.3% biracial, and 2.3% “other.” Change in catastrophic misinterpretations (assessed with the Brief Body Sensations Interpretation Questionnaire; Clark et al., 1997) was used to predict a variety of treatment outcomes, including overall panic symptom severity (assessed with the Panic Disorder Severity Scale [PDSS]; Shear et al., 1997), panic attack frequency (assessed with the relevant PDSS item), panic-related distress/apprehension (assessed by a latent factor, including peak anxiety in response to a panic-relevant stressor—a straw breathing task), and avoidance (assessed by a latent factor, which included the Fear Questionnaire–Agoraphobic Avoidance subscale; Marks & Mathews, 1979). Results: Bivariate latent difference score modeling indicated that, as expected, change in catastrophic misinterpretations predicted subsequent reductions in overall symptom severity, panic attack frequency, distress/apprehension, and avoidance behavior. However, change in the various symptom domains was not typically a significant predictor of later interpretation change (except for the distress/apprehension factor). Conclusions: These results provide considerable support for the cognitive model of panic and speak to the temporal sequence of change processes during therapy.

Abstract = {The current study examined the ethnic identity of White (N = 120), Latino (N = 87), and African-American (N = 65) children and early adolescents (aged = 9–14 years), with an emphasis on whether the specific ethnic label White children used to describe themselves might reflect differences in their inter-group attitudes and whether those differences mirror group differences between White children and children in ethnic minority groups. Results indicated that White children who identified with a minority label (i.e., White biracial, hyphenated American, ethnic/cultural/religious label) had more positive ethnic identities, were more aware of discrimination, and were less likely to show biases in their perceived similarity to in-group and out-group peers than youth who identified as White or American. In many instances, White children who identified with a minority label did not differ from ethnic minority youth. In addition, although all participants were more positive about their ethnic in-group than out-groups, children who identified their ethnicity as American were less positive about out-groups relative to other children. Taken together, the findings indicate that children’s self-chosen ethnic identity is as important as their ascribed ethnic or racial identity in predicting their inter-group attitudes.

Abstract = {Background: Increasingly, researchers have begun to explore pathways through which psychosocial factors might influence cardiovascular disease, with some emphasis on early markers. The current study examined the cross-sectional association between psychosocial factors and aortic pulse wave velocity (an early marker of cardiovascular disease) in a biracial cohort of older adults. We were particularly interested in determining whether the association between psychosocial factors and aortic pulse wave velocity differed for older blacks compared with whites. Methods: Participants were 2,488 (40% black and 52% female) older adults from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. Carotid–femoral aortic pulse wave velocity was assessed using standard methodologies. Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, negative life events, and inadequate emotional support were assessed, and a summary psychosocial risk index was created. Results: In multivariable linear regression models, psychosocial risk was not associated with aortic pulse wave velocity (Estimate [Est] = .00, p = .83), but there was a significant Race × Psychosocial risk interaction (Est = .07, p = .01), after adjusting for age, race, sex, and education. Further analyses revealed that this association was driven by the inadequate emotional support component of psychosocial risk (Race × Inadequate emotional support, p = .005). In race-stratified analyses, inadequate emotional support was associated with higher levels of arterial stiffness in older blacks (Est = .05, p = .04) but not whites (Est = −.04, p = .13). This association persisted after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and social network characteristics. Conclusions: Findings suggest that older blacks may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of inadequate emotional support on vascular health. Interventions aimed at increasing social support among this population might be beneficial in reducing cardiovascular disease risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Diverse by Design: Literacy Education in Multicultural Institutions by C. Schroeder (2011). This book is a polyglot of a monograph, weaving together many voices to evaluate higher education’s service to students who speak Spanish as a first language. Though Chris Schroeder labels the book an institutional case study of Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), his aim is broader: to show how college level literacy instruction does not fully support students who speak English as a second language (ESL). Schroeder approaches this topic by outlining NEIU’s institutional context, then describing student experiences, and finally suggesting strategies for pluralistic education. Between chapters, Schroeder intersperses autobiographical interludes, reflecting on his work as a composition instructor at NEIU and his experiences as a parent of bilingual, biracial children. The book’s polyvocality provides powerful support to Schroeder’s thesis, and his reflexive interludes underline the urgency of his suggested reforms. He highlights the need to prepare multilingual students for a country that expects monolingual English skills, while calling on English-speaking higher education to prepare for students with increasingly diverse modes of expression.

Abstract = {This study examines the literary representation of adopted Chinese girls’ psychological sense of community in Chinese-American communities. Psychological sense of community is defined as the perception that an individual is part of an inclusive social network (Hill, 1996). This sense is multi-dimensional; three specific dimensions are living in a bicultural community, participating in cultural festivals, and replicating birth-country food practices (e.g., Frost, 2008; Mannarini & Fedi, 2009). The researchers identified 37 children’s books that featured portrayals of Chinese girls adopted by U.S. families. A content analysis was conducted to determine the extent that the three dimensions were evident in the books. The analysis was based on concepts drawn from the community psychology literature. All three senses of community dimensions are described, and a fourth dimension (compensatory information/symbol) is identified.

Abstract = {Multiracial individuals report that the social pressure of having to “choose” one of their racial groups is a primary source of psychological conflict. Yet because of their ability to maneuver among their multiple identities, multiracials also adopt flexible cognitive strategies in dealing with their social environments—demonstrating a benefit to having multiple racial identities. The current article reviews recent research involving multiracial participants to examine the behavioral and cognitive outcomes linked to being multiracial and pinpoints possible moderators that may affect these outcomes. Limitations in applying monoracial identity frameworks to multiracial populations are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Adopting maternity: White women who adopt transracially or transnationally by Nora Rose Moosnich (2004). In her research, Nora Rose Moosnick conducted in-depth interviews with 22 women, seven of whom adopted white children who were born in the United States, seven adopted Asian children (mostly Korean), and eight adopted black and biracial children. The author reports that race was not discussed in the narratives of women with white children, but discussed at length among mothers who adopted black and biracial children. The mothers who adopted Asian children emphasized cultural concerns, not race. Moosnick also discusses the relationships between birth mothers and the adoptive mothers, especially those who adopted black and biracial children. One of the major problems I had with this book is the lack of straight forward information on the age and gender of the children, the presence of birth children, and marital status of the mothers. Nor does she describe in any detail the quality of the interaction between the mothers and the children, or about the relationships between the birth (if there are any) children and the adopted siblings. I found Adopting Maternity a disappointing read. I wish that the author had spent less time theorizing about feminism and social constructionism and more time writing about the quality of the interactions between the adoptive mothers and their white, Asian, black and biracial adopted children.

Without having had the influence of institutional religion in my childhood, and having lived the majority of my life in the San Francisco Bay Area, demographically the region with the least amount of regular church attendance in the country, Holy Week is unfamiliar terrain for me. Yet, as a biracial lesbian and self-identified queer who entered ministry in her early twenties, my immersion into the unfamiliar is, paradoxically, familiar.

Abstract = {The design of the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) is described. CHAP is a longitudinal population study of common chronic health problems of older persons, especially of risk factors for incident Alzheimer's disease, in a biracial neighborhood of the south side of Chicago. Special attention is given to three unusual design features of the study. One feature is that clinical evaluation for Alzheimer's disease is confined to a stratified random sample of all participants. This feature results in substantial cost savings and substantially less bias than screening approaches but has the disadvantages of adding analytic complexity and requiring the use of indirect means to identify a disease-free cohort for the development of incident Alzheimer's disease. The second unusual feature is efficiently combining in analyses the successive independent multiple samples that are drawn, one from each data collection cycle. The third unusual feature is entering successive age cohorts of community residents into the study as they attain 65 years of age. This has the advantages of enhancing direct investigation of the effect of age on the action of risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and direct examination of cohort effects. The interaction of these features is described, especially as they pertain to a study in which data are collected in successive waves. The results from these waves must be combined for effective analysis of the relation among risk factors and incident disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

One limitation of previous studies has been that they did not examine how the positive effect of racial interaction on White racial tolerance may be enhanced or reduced by other factors. This article tests five hypotheses derived from the basic assumption of social interaction theory. Employing ecological inference procedure, a newly developed method, this study uses the precinct-level data from New Orleans' 29 biracial elections to estimate White crossover voting at the neighborhood level. The hypotheses are tested by both ordinary least squares and weighted least squares models. White crossover voting is positively related to Black density. The positive effect of Black density, however, is relatively weak. Other factors such as the racial composition of candidate field and election type are more important. Caution needs to be exercised in accepting the social interaction theory. The level of racial competition in biracial elections may reverse White support for Black candidates.

Using the multi-stage cluster sampling method, 884 adolescents aged 12 to 16 participated in this study. Three hundred and ninety-one were biracial (44.2%) and 493 were monoracial (55.8%). No difference was found between groups in all measures of life adjustment. Path analyses indicated that relationships between the proposed explanatory variables and life adjustment were not quite the same for the two groups of adolescents. However, minority racial identity and perceived racial discrimination predicted the life adjustment of adolescents from new immigrant families. Minority racial identity had both direct and indirect effects on psychological and behavioral adjustment, but had indirect effects on educational performance and peer relationship. Perceived racial discrimination only had indirect effects on life adjustment via self-esteem. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess whether the risk of incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) varies over time. The increase in numbers of people at the oldest ages in the population will bring an increase in the number of people with AD. Projections of the size of the increase assume the risk of AD is constant. Methods: All persons age 65 or older in a biracial, geographically defined area were invited to participate in a home interview every 3 years. From the approximately 10,000 participants, stratified random samples were selected for detailed clinical evaluation. At each cycle, individuals determined free of AD in a previous cycle, either by examination or by high score on cognitive function tests, were sampled in the subsequent cycle for evaluation for incident AD. The evaluations for disease were structured and uniform across time. These analyses include 1,695 subjects evaluated for incident disease from 1997 through 2008. Results: AD developed in 360 participants. Change over time in risk of incident disease was assessed in logistic regression analyses including evaluation date and controlling for age, gender, education, race, interval from disease-free designation to evaluation for incident disease, and sample design. The time variable (in years) was not significant (odds ratio = 0.970, 95% confidence interval = 0.902 to 1.044). Conclusions: The null relation of evaluation date to disease incidence suggests no recent change in risk of AD over time, and supports this assumption for projections of AD.

Abstract = {Objective: The apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 allele genotype is a risk factor for dementia, but not all people with the APOE ε4 allele develop cognitive impairment (CI). Among participants with the APOE ε4 allele (N = 664), we identified biological, psychological, and social variables that discriminate between participants who develop CI from those who do not. We then determined if these variables predicted CI in noncarriers (N = 1421). In the sample as a whole we then determined if each of these identified variables moderate the relationship between the APOE ε4 allele and CI. Methods: We used data from a biracial community-dwelling sample of older adults. Data were collected at four time points over a 10-year period. Cognitive functioning was assessed at each wave, using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). APOE genotyping was performed at Wave 3. Results: Among APOE ε4 allele carriers, but not noncarriers, variables associated with CI included white race, female gender, low BMI, number of negative life events, and health problems (high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke). In analyses testing for moderate effects and including the entire sample, significant interactions with APOE ε4 allele and predictor variables revealed that white race, low BMI, stroke, heart disease, and negative life events had a greater effect on CI among those with the APOE ε4 allele compared to those without the allele. Conclusion: There are biological, psychological, and social variables associated with increased risk for CI among individuals with the APOE ε4 allele.

Abstract = {Objective: Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of dopamine, is necessary for cognitive function. Few studies have examined the prospective association between COMT (val¹⁵⁸met) genotype and cognition in older adults. Methods: We assessed a biracial cohort of 2,858 elderly subjects without dementia who were followed for 8 years. The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) were administered at baseline and years 3, 5, and 8. COMT by race, gender, and APOE status interactions were examined. Results: Stratified by race and adjusted for covariates, repeated-measures mixed-effects models showed no association between COMT genotype and baseline cognitive function in black or white subjects. In white subjects, COMT was associated with change in 3MS (Met/Met: -2.3 [0.60], Met/Val: -1.7 [0.40], and Val/Val: -1.2 [0.50]) and DSST (Met/Met: -5.60 [1.00], Met/Val: -4.80 [0.70], Val/Val: -4.00 [0.90]). In black subjects, COMT was associated with change in the DSST (Met/Met: -4.10 [2.1], Met/Val: -4.80 [0.90], Val/Val -2.60 [1.00]).

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate whether an association exists between experiences of everyday discrimination and blood pressure (BP) dipping in a biracial sample of black and white adults. Attenuated nocturnal BP dipping is closely linked to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Self-reported experiences of everyday discrimination have also been associated with negative cardiovascular health outcomes. Methods: Seventy-eight hypertensive and normotensive women and men (n = 30 black and 48 white) reported on their experiences of everyday discrimination (Everyday Discrimination Scale) and underwent two separate 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) sessions approximately 1 week apart. Results: Correlation analysis revealed that higher endorsement of everyday discrimination was significantly associated with less diastolic BP (DBP) and systolic BP (SBP) dipping (p < .05). Subsequent hierarchical regression analyses indicated that everyday discrimination explained 8% to 11% of the variance in SBP and DBP dipping above and beyond other demographic and life-style-related factors, including race, age, 24-hour BP, body mass index, and current socioeconomic status. The relationship between discrimination and dipping was significantly stronger on the second night of monitoring. Finally, analyses revealed that everyday discrimination mediated the relationship between race and BP dipping. Conclusions: These findings suggest that experiences of everyday discrimination are associated with less nocturnal SBP and DBP dipping above and beyond the effect of known covariates. The use of multiple ABPM sessions may facilitate the detection of relationships between psychological variables and BP dipping. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Two common methods of measuring socioeconomic status (SES) were examined in relation to observed parenting behaviors in a clinical sample of 89 mothers of 3- to 6-year-olds referred for treatment of oppositional defiant disorder. Families were 74% Caucasian, 9% African American, 5% Hispanic, 1% Asian, and 11% Biracial. Most children were male (75%). Parenting behaviors were measured with the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS) categories of prosocial talk and negative talk. Analyses were conducted with SES measured in two ways: (a) the Hollingshead Four-Factor Index of Social Status (HI) was correlated with parenting behaviors; and (b) family income, parent education (5 categories), and parent occupation (5 categories) were used to predict parent behavior. SES was significantly positively related to maternal prosocial talk. When SES was operationalized as income, occupation, and education, the model predicted three times more variance in maternal prosocial talk than the HI alone. SES was not related to maternal negative talk by either measure of SES. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Intercountry adoption has been, and continues to be, a popular method of family formation worldwide, as well as a means of providing homes for children who would otherwise remain parentless. The popularity of this social welfare practice suggests that countless families continue to face the challenges of raising children whose ethnicities derive from two different ethnic backgrounds. Yet, virtually no research exists on the development of a bicultural ethnic identity in intercountry adoption. Instead, research has focused on the importance of birth-culture socialization, or the lack thereof. Faced with too little direct research on the subject, this paper synthesizes and critically reviews literature from the ethnic socialization, biracial, acculturation, and adoption fields. The aim was twofold: (1) extrapolate key elements of the literature that inform on the development of biculturalism in intercountry adoptions; and (2) identify gaps in the literature. Suggestions for future research and practice are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Signithia Fordham challenges the notion that we are living in a "postracial" society where race is no longer a major social category, as indicated by the rising incidence of interracial relationships and the popularity of biracial identities. On the contrary, she contends, a powerful fusion of historical memory and inclusive kinship compels Americans whose ancestors were enslaved to embrace a Black identity even when they have White as well as African ancestors. Fordham identifies this socially constructed racial identity as "passin' for Black." She argues that virtually every socially defined Black person connected to enslavement—regardless of skin color, hair texture, facial features, or paternity—must perform Blackness. Using narratives obtained from a recent ethnographic study of female competition and aggression in a racially "integrated " suburban high school, Fordham's essay documents how the complex, charged matter of racial identity—concurrently biological and social—inflames the lives of adolescents and impairs their ability to navigate the school environment.

Abstract = {This symposium emerged organically when we received two separate articles that provoked considerable emotion, discussion, and excitement among the members of the Editorial Board. On receiving Signithia Fordham's article "Passin' for Black: Race, Identity, and Bone Memory in Postracial America," we believed it was groundbreaking work—a piece that would push readers toward new ways of thinking. Shortly thereafter we received Carmen Kynard's "From Candy Girls to Cyber Sista-Cipher: Narrating Black Females' Color- Consciousness and Counterstories in and out of School." Each componen of this symposium contributes unique insights to our understanding of race, identity, and education. Fordham challenges the notion that we are living in a postracial society by unpacking the largely biracial identity of Black people in the United States. Fordham and Kynard ask us to reconsider Blackness and Black femaleness in a time prematurely described by some as "postracial." As many rush to declare that America no longer sees color, both authors remind us that we still have blind spots. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {There is a growing number of mixed-race people in the United States and a growing number of individuals who identify as mixed-race or multiracial. In the last census, 6.8 million people identified as multiracial, marking more than one racial category to identify themselves or their children, with 42 percent under 18 years of age (Jones & Symens Smith, 2001). The "biracial baby boom" of the 1970s and 1980s produced a notable cohort of multiracial individuals (Bratter, 2007) and resulted in an increase in the number of mixed-race individuals from 500,000 in 1970 to nearly 7 million in 2000 (Krebs, 2000; Shih & Sanchez, 2005). Given this growing population, mental health practitioners will likely be working with increasing numbers of multiracial individuals (Kerwin, Ponterotto, Jackson, & Harris, 1993); thus, it is important for therapists and counselors to have an awareness and knowledge of the experiences of this population and to be able to transfer this awareness and knowledge into skills useful in working with multiracial individuals. Competent, ethical multicultural practice requires understanding and addressing the unique characteristics and mental health needs of this population. This chapter will provide the reader with guidelines and resources for increasing awareness of one's own values and attitudes, knowledge of ecological issues related to people of mixed ancestry, and skills in developing competency in working with persons of mixed ancestry. Case studies are included and will be referred to throughout the chapter to illustrate critical concepts. Pouse & Ponder exercises will be included throughout the chapter to prompt the reader to stop, reflect, and engage in a more contemplative and dynamic way with the concepts in this text, thus increasing personal awareness and recognition of multicultural issues as they relate to people of mixed ancestry (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Moore (see record [rid]2005-12510-000[/rid]). This text provides a detailed manual for professionals conducting group therapy for children and adolescents. It includes tips for the finer points of the group therapy process. This edition represents an improvement over the original because it more thoroughly addresses issues of diversity, based on the authors' experience implementing the group model in multiethnic, multicultural neighborhoods, schools, and family agencies. This edition also provides a separate section especially for younger school-age children and adolescents. The cultural additions made by the authors appeared to be based on their experiences with groups over the years, and are likely to cover many of the cultural issues that arise in culturally diverse settings when conducting these groups. However, little or no attention was given to the special circumstances of biracial children of divorcing parents. Similarly, children of highly conflictual or separating gay or lesbian parents were not addressed in this edition. These issues are likely to be highly sensitive, as biracial children may have an deeper identity dilemma as they may sense that they not only have to choose a parent, but also a race.

Abstract = {Employed a case study of 102 Black college students at a predominantly White liberal arts college  to question continuing assumptions in sociological research that Blacks represent social, cultural, and economic homogeneity and that intraracial relations are close and without conflict. The authors examined the extent to which Black students feel close to other black students on campus, rely on one another for need satisfaction and social interaction, and share similar values, experiences, and attitudes. The authors find that the odds of closeness are significantly reduced for biracial students, for Black students from low SES backgrounds, and for Black students from predominantly White backgrounds. Among biracial students and those from predominantly White environments, social distance reflected their overall distance from the larger Black community and is a function of their lack of racial awareness. The social distance of low SES students appeared specific to the community of Black students within the college and is not expressed toward the larger black community. Moreover, feelings of distance appeared to be driven by perceived social, cultural, and economic differences from other Black students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Silverman, University of Nevada, Las Vegas; Roslyn M. Caldwell, California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2008-03115-005[/rid]). The present study examined the relationships among various aspects of peer relationships to violence in 128 female juvenile offenders representing four racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and biracial/multiracial). Results revealed that high levels of peer association and extrinsic rewards from peer relationships best predicted violence among all groups. Furthermore, among Hispanics, positive peer attitudes toward delinquency significantly contributed to violence. Among Caucasians, greater time spent with peers was associated with higher levels of violence. For African Americans, tangible rewards from peer relationships significantly contributed to violence. No significant results were found among biracial/multiracial female offenders. The findings from this study highlight the significant influence of peer relationships on violence among juvenile offenders and suggest the need for further research on racial and ethnic differences.

Through anecdotes about her own children, excerpts from research interviews she has conducted and essays written by her students, as well as clearly synthesized summaries of the work of eminent social scientists and other scholars, the author presents compelling evidence that suggests that we must all examine our racial identities—whatever they are—if true social change is to take place. (publicity materials), The author explains that all of us have a racial identity and must strive to affirm it. For people of color, the development of a constructive racial identity requires being able to recognize and reject the bombardment of negative stereotypes and to embrace a history of resistance and empowerment rather than passive victimization. For Whites, the challenge is to engage in a process of racial identity development which leads to an awareness of White privilege )},

A 14-yr-old biracial girl who admitted to 1 of her teachers that she dreamt about killing people and wanted to run away from home was called in for a meeting with her mother and a family therapist. In the first session, the mother and daughter had several angry exchanges and appeared anxious. The therapist passed around a lilac and inhaling the bloom's fragrance encouraged relaxing deep breathing and a calmer state.

Abstract = {Examines family achievement orientation as perceived by Black adolescent students in an urban school district and how these perceptions affected students' attitudes, beliefs, and values about schooling. Ss were 144 Black, 1 Hispanic, and 3 biracial students (aged 9–14 yrs) of low SES. Ss' responses to the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents were recorded onto a questionnaire, measuring the amount of agreement and disagreement among the sample relative to the social, psychological, and cultural issues perceived to promote or hinder achievement. Family demographic variables contributed little to Ss' achievement orientation. Such variables as parents' level of education, occupation, employment status, and primary caregiver had little influence on level of support for the social, cultural, and psychological variables held by the Ss. Family or parent achievement orientation had a greater influence on Ss' achievement orientation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {America has been the breeding ground of a "biracial baby boom" for the past 25 years. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of information regarding how racially mixed people identify and view themselves and how they relate to one another. "Racially Mixed People in America" steadily bridges this gap, and offers a comprehensive look at the social and psychological adjustment of multiracial people, models for identity development, contemporary immigration and marriage patterns, and methodological issues involved in conducting research with mixed-race people, all in the context of America's multiracial past and present. Including contributions by ethnohistorians, psychologists, and sociologists, this powerful volume will provide the reader a tool for examining ideologies surrounding race, race relations, and the role of social science in the deconstruction of race.  "Racially Mixed People in America" is essential reading for researchers and practitioners in cross-cultural studies, psychology, family studies, sociology, and social work.

Abstract = {This study tested a social-ecological model of adolescent substance use. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate how systems, such as parents, peers, schools, and communities, directly influence and interact together to influence adolescent substance use. Participants included 14,548 (50.3% female) middle school students who were 78.6% White, 5.4% Biracial, 4.8% Asian, 4.8% Black, and 3.6% Hispanic. Participants completed a survey with scales assessing substance use, peer influences, parental influences, and characteristics of their school and community. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to consider the variation of parental and peer influences on substance use and how schools and communities relate to both substance use and the relationship between substance use and peer and parental factors. Results indicated that a positive school climate and a positive sense of community were associated with less adolescent substance use and that a positive sense of community moderated the relation between peer and parental influence on adolescent substance use, thereby acting as a protective factor.

Abstract = {Background: Up to 17% of children in the United States have been diagnosed with asthma; children ages 9-14 years experience higher morbidity and mortality compared with other age groups. An academic and counseling program for older elementary students with asthma was developed in collaboration with school personnel, healthcare professionals, and community members: Staying Healthy-Asthma Responsible and Prepared (SHARP). The life span development perspective and the Acceptance of Asthma Model were used to guide development and implementation. Objectives: This study aimed to establish the preliminary efficacy of SHARP to improve cognitive, behavioral, psychosocial, and quality-of-life outcomes. Methods: A two-group, longitudinal, prospective, cluster randomized clinical trial design was used. The sample of fourth- to sixth-grade students (N = 66) with asthma aged 9-12 years (M = 10.5, SD = 0.9) was 52% male, was racially diverse (30% Black, 36% White, and 18% biracial), and had a wide range of incomes. Three schools (n = 38 students) were randomized to receive SHARP, and two schools (n = 28 students) were assigned to usual care. Self-report instruments were used. Results: Compared with the usual care group, statistically significant improvements in the SHARP group were found in student knowledge of asthma, reasoning about asthma, use of risk reduction behaviors, and participation in life activities (p < .01, effect sizes >0.7). Improvements in use of episode management behaviors and acceptance of asthma outcomes were clinically significant with medium effect sizes of 0.3-0.5. Discussion: The SHARP Student and Community Components demonstrated preliminary efficacy for improving asthma knowledge, reasoning about asthma, use of episode management and risk reduction behaviors, acceptance of asthma in taking control and vigilance, and participation in life activities.

Abstract = {Lesbian, gay, and bisexual students (LGB) and those questioning their sexual orientation are often at great risk for negative outcomes like depression, suicidality, drug use, and school difficulties (Elliot and Kilpatrick, How to Stop Bullying, A KIDSCAPE Guide to Training, 1994; Mufoz-Plaza et al., High Sch J 85:52–63, 2002; Treadway and Yoakam, J School Health 62(7):352–357, 1992). This study examined how school contextual factors such as homophobic victimization and school climate influence negative outcomes in LGB and questioning middle school students. Participants were 7,376 7th and 8th grade students from a large Midwestern county (50.7% Female, 72.7% White, 7.7% Biracial, 6.9% Black, 5.2% Asian, 3.7% Hispanic, and 2.2% reported "other"). LGB and sexually questioning youth were more likely to report high levels of bullying, homophobic victimization, and various negative outcomes than heterosexual youth. Students who were questioning their sexual orientation reported the most bullying, the most homophobic victimization, the most drug use, the most feelings of depression and suicidality, and more truancy than either heterosexual or LGB students. A positive school climate and a lack of homophobic victimization moderated the differences among sexual orientation status and outcomes. Results indicate that schools have the ability to lessen negative outcomes for LGB and sexually questioning students through creating positive climates and reducing homophobic teasing.

Abstract = {We investigate the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents through a comparison of the size and composition of the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents with single race adolescents. We consider three hypotheses suggested by the literature on multiraciality and interracial friendships: (1) that multiracial adolescents have smaller friendship networks than single-race adolescents because they are more often rejected by their single race peers, (2) that multiracial adolescents form more racially diverse friendship networks than single-race adolescents, and (3) that multiracial adolescents are especially likely to bridge (or socially connect) friendships among members of their single-race heritage background groups. Using data on adolescent friendship networks from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we find that multiracial adolescents are as popular as non-white adolescents and have social networks that are as racially diverse as the single-race groups with the most diverse friendship networks. Biracial adolescents with black ancestry have an especially high rate of friendship bridging between black persons and persons of other races, relative to black or white adolescents. The results hold using both self-identified and parental race definitions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This study investigated moderators of change in an empirically supported family-centered intervention (the Family Check-Up) for problem behavior in early childhood. Participants were 731 2- to 3-year-olds (49% girls; 28% African American, 50% European American, 13% biracial) from low-income families and had been screened for risk of family stress and early-onset problem behavior. They were randomized to the Family Check-Up intervention or to a no-intervention control group. Latent growth models examined sociodemographic and parent psychological risk factors as potential moderators of change in problem behavior between ages 2, 3, and 4. Results revealed 2 moderators of intervention effectiveness. Caregivers with the lowest educational levels were more responsive to the family-centered intervention, and 2-parent families were more responsive to the intervention. Other risk factors showed no predictive effects. Overall, findings suggest that this brief family-centered intervention can be equally effective in reaching the most distressed and most disadvantaged families, compared to those who are more advantaged. However, results suggest that more attention may be needed to address the intervention needs of single parent families in reducing problem behavior in early childhood.

Abstract = {Recent changes to federal guidelines for the collection of data on race and ethnicity allow respondents to select multiple race categories. Redefining race subgroups in this manner poses problems for research spanning both sets of definitions. NAEP long-term trends have used the single-race subgroup definitions for over thirty years. Little is known about the effects of redefining race subgroups on these trends. Bridging methods for reconciling the single and multiple race definitions have been developed. These methods treat single-race subgroup membership as unknown or missing. A simulation study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of four bridging methods: multiple imputation logistic regression, multiple imputation probabilistic whole assignment, deterministic whole assignment—smallest group, and deterministic whole assignment—largest group. Only the first of these methods incorporates covariate information about examinees into the bridging procedure. The other three methods only use information contained in the race item response. The simulation took into account the percentage of biracial examinees and the missing data mechanism. Results indicated that the multiple imputation logistic regression was often the best performing method. Given that all K-12 and higher education institutions will be required to use the multiple-race definitions by 2009, implications for No Child Left Behind and other federally mandated reporting are discussed.

Abstract = {Background/Context: For the last 40 years, researchers have posited competing theories regarding the relative influence of social class background and racial-group membership on the school experiences, academic performance, behavior, and motivation of ethnic minority students. The general purpose of these competing theories has been to explain why ethnic minority students fail or succeed in schools. Many of these theories consider factors inside the school and the child’s family, culture, racial/ethnic group affiliation, and responses to school. These theories are commonly situated into three categories of thought: cultural deprivation, cultural difference/discontinuity, and cultural ecology. Each theory juxtaposes dimensions of race as a significant variable, but each has omitted the meaning of race/ ethnicity as internally and externally constructed, particularly among Latino groups. Focus of Study: The study focused on discerning (1) how the students defined their own racial/ethnic identification and how they perceived that others defined them; (2) how they discussed the opportunities available for the social group with which they identified and the social group with which they believed others situated them; and (3) how the students’ academic orientation (which reflected their educational and occupational aspirations, participation in cocurricular activities, and accommodation to schooling norms) related to their experiences of racial and ethnic identification and their perceptions of opportunity. Population: Interviews were conducted with 17 high school students. The students ranged from Grade 9 to Grade 12. In addition, students identified as Mexican or Puerto Rican. Research Design: Qualitative interviews were conducted at three data points with participants. The interview protocol consisted of four main sections: (1) familial, socioeconomic, and migratory background of each student; (2) student’s ethnic identification and construction; (3) student’s academic orientation (i.e., educational and occupational aspirations, interpretation of school utility, school engagement, school experiences, and academic performance); and (4) students’ interpretation of constraint and opportunity. Conclusions/Recommendations: This study represents an initial foray into a complex conversation on internal and external social identification, racial constructs, and interaction as part of the schooling experience of Latino students. Two significant findings from the larger study are reported in this article. First, the negotiation of identity among these Mexican and Puerto Rican students in predominantly African American schools demonstrates racial/ethnic boundary designations (i.e., who is in and who is out) as structured by skin color. Second, what is meant to be designated as White-looking, Hispanic/Mexican-looking, or Black/biracial-looking maintained differing meaning and latitude in the racial/ethnic boundary options across skin color groups. Both these findings posit further questioning as to what we know about identification among Latino students and, more important, how it gets played out in schools.

Abstract = {Objectives: The apolipoproteinE ∈4 (APOE ∈4) allele and a history of depression are each separate risk factors for cognitive decline (CD). However, little research has investigated whether a history of depression influences the relationship between APOE ∈4 and CD. The present study examined whether depressive symptoms had greater influence on subsequent CD among participants with APOE ∈4 than those without the allele. Design: Prospective 6-year longitudinal study. Setting: Community in-home interviews. Participants: A biracial sample of community dwelling older adults (N = 1,992) from the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE). Measurements: Data were drawn from Waves 1 to 3 of the EPESE, which were conducted 6 years apart. Cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms were assessed at both waves, and APOE genotyping was completed during the Wave 3 assessment. Results: Regression analyses revealed that depressive symptoms and the APOE ∈4 allele independently predicted CD. Importantly, the influence of depressive symptoms on CD was greater for individuals with the APOE ∈4 allele compared with those without the allele. Conclusion: Depressive symptoms and the APOE ∈4 allele are independent contributors to CD. Moreover, the influence of depressive symptoms on CD is greater among individuals with the APOE ∈4 allele. Depression and the APOE ∈4 allele may act together in disrupting neurological functioning, which may in turn lower an individual’s cognitive reserve capacity. Given the efficacious treatments currently available for depression, future research should investigate the extent to which interventions for depression may reduce the risk for subsequent CD.

The U.S. National Library of Medicine's PubMed Web site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi) listed only 3 references to dementia in 1935, a total of 25 in 1950, and approximately 550 in 1960. By 2007, there were over 90,000 references. Within the past 30 years, the general public has become familiar with dementia, in large measure due to the efforts of the Alzheimer's Association. People's interest in the topic is evidenced by the fact that the Internet bookseller Amazon.com lists more than 25,000 titles that include the word dementia. With regard to a specific disease, the prevalence of Alzheimer disease in the United States (estimated from a population-based, biracial urban study converted to prevalence estimates and applied to the U.S. population) was 4.5 million in 2000 by one widely accepted estimate (Hebert el al. 2003). This prevalence is expected to nearly triple, to 13.3 million, by 2050. If Alzheimer disease accounts for 56% of dementia cases, as indicated in the Framingham Study (Bachman et al. 1992), the total number of elderly persons in the United States with dementia in 2000 was more than 8 million. A 15-year epidemiological study that initially enrolled more than 1,600 nondemented persons age 65 years or older found that 5% of the deaths were attributed to Alzheimer disease, with an average time from onset to death of 5.9 years (Ganguli et al. 2005). Thus, Alzheimer disease and dementing illness in general are important public health issues, as discussed in Chapter 2 of this volume, "Epidemiology and Impact of Dementia."

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of offering separate reading classes to students in middle school, there is little empirical evidence suggesting that these courses support students' comprehension across the content areas. Therefore, this case study of a biracial Navajo and Paiute 8th-grade middle school student examined his reading comprehension and motivation with regard to his attendance in a separate reading class. Although he applied more reading comprehension strategies in his reading class by the end of the year, he did not apply these strategies to his other classes. Similarly, although he reported being more motivated to read, he attributed this change to a growing interest in his Native American heritage, rather than to the separate reading class.

Abstract = {The paper describes the treatment of a six-year-old biracial Spanish and English-speaking girl' named "Clare." When Clare is referred for treatment she is seen for symptoms of an agitated depression and rage episodes at school."Her anger sometimes spills over into physical violence. The integration of her turbulent emotions is accompanied by her return to an early developmental period, when she was more at peace. Her regression leads her to uncover some painful-traumatic memories surrounding her parents' separation and fears of abandonment. During her treatment, she recalls a dream of metamorphosis into a beautiful butterfly that flies to Jupiter. This dream gives coherence to many of her trays. The article shows through sandplay and art how Clare underwent a momentary death to her childhood self—a "shadowy girl who died"—with all of her painful complexes, followed by a metamorphosis into a new structure of identity. The author asserts that Clare's symbolizations support Jung's hypothesis of two apparently distinct developmental stages (one instinctual, the other spiritual), and adds that that the self in this little girl is duplex: the supraordinate personality is a composite of maiden and mother. The self-figure is a portrayed in her last drawing. The paper illuminates what Murray Stein calls a "transformative image" in a little girl; the emerging self-image mirrors a hidden radiance of the divinity.

Abstract = {Over the last decade, a number of biracial persons have achieved positions of prominence in the United States. Tiger Woods, son of an African American father and an Asian mother, is one of the world's best and most celebrated golfers. Halle Berry, Academy Award-winning actress, is the daughter of an African American father and a white mother. Norah Jones, celebrated musician, is the daughter of a white mother and an Indian father, while Barack Obama, the current president of the United States, is the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya. While much attention has been paid to these accomplished individuals, much less attention has been paid to the interracial marriages that produced them. Yet, their very presence is a reflection of the extent to which interracial marriage is a rapidly growing phenomenon in the United States. What are the implications of this increasing rate of intermarriage as a reflection of and, simultaneously, a catalyst for social change? Given our society's historic reliance on rigid classifications, especially in regard to race, do these marriages result in identity conflicts for the partners, both as individuals and as a couple? To what extent do interracial couples find family and societal support for their choice of partner? To what extent do they struggle with negative responses to the breaking of what some have labeled "the last taboo"? And what are the implications for partner and couple well-being? In this chapter, we explore these questions in the context of what is known and what is not known about the factors associated with the growing phenomenon of interracial marriage.

Abstract = {Reviews the film, The visitor directed by Thomas McCarthy (2008). The Visitor is a little New York story (though it could be set in any large metropolis) about big issues, performed by extraordinary actors with an excellent script. It covers a little more than 10 days in the life of Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins), a middle-aged, socially awkward, widowed, burnt-out, economics professor at a Connecticut college. His is not the leading male role one expects today, and moviegoers may balk at the idea of spending an evening watching an aging, gray man. But the wonderful writing and direction of Thomas McCarthy (The Station Agent, 2003), the excellent supporting cast, and Jenkins’s amazing and understated Oscar-nominated performance make this movie a “must see.” Walter, unforgiving with his students, disinterested in his profession, and surly with his peers, is the class picture of a burnt-out academic (Freudenberger & Richelson, 1980). He is forced by circumstances to deliver a paper in New York (his coauthor is on bed rest for her pregnancy), but a funny thing happens when he arrives in the city. He finds a young, biracial illegal immigrant couple in his New York City apartment. Tarek (Haaz Sleiman), a drummer from Syria, and Zainab (Danai Gurira) from Senegal, who makes jewelry she sells on the street, are living in Walter’s apartment. Realizing that they have rented Walter’s apartment from a scam artist, they leave. As Walter watches them leave from his window, he realizes that they have nowhere to go and tells them they can stay, for a while. Reciprocal small kindnesses follow the generous gesture, and relationships develop. Tarek teaches Walter to play drums. This gift alters Walter’s life. The first inkling of change is Walter’s pleasure as he uses his feet to tip the drum off the floor. It is a revelatory moment for the character and a lovely bit of acting by Jenkins. By the end of the film, Walter is no longer weary and detached but is involved in his life and experiencing a wide range of emotions—joy, anger, sadness, and pleasure. He is no longer an impoverished person; he is on the path to being psychologically wealthy (Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2008). And viewers are also emotionally wealthier in having seen this beautifully written, directed, and acted film. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Interracial families: Current concepts and controversies by George Yancey and Richard Lewis (2009). This small book makes several unique contributions to the study of race relations: its focus on interracial dating, the issues that the children of interracial unions face, and the examination of how race relations and interracial dating have been portrayed in the media. George Yancey has probably examined interracial dating more than other scholar today. In this book Yancy and Lewis contextualize interracial dating and marriage within fairly traditional theoretical discussions. They use several perspectives: the assimilationist perspective associated with Milton Gordon and others, Merton’s perspective on exchange relationships–that interracial couples exchange the status characteristics of beauty and race, and the issues associated with the “one-drop” rule–that anyone with any African ancestry is defined as African American. In the end this book is about the emerging of groups and phenomena that will continue to reduce racism. The interesting and broader range of biracial and bi-ethnic groups we will see in the coming decades–groups that do not fit nicely in to previous racial and ethnic groupings– will continue to break down the traditional classifications or racial and ethnic groups.

In this edited book, the authors of each chapter discuss application of the Guidelines to a number of different ethnic groups, including Asian American, African American, Latino American, American Indian and Alaskan Native, Arab American, and biracial populations. Finally, the application of social justice issues in clinical practice and research is considered. This book on culturally competent practices provides useful information for educators, researchers, and practitioners and is important for a number of reasons. Therefore, practitioners in the field of psychology as well as in a number of other professions will benefit from the information found in the various chapters and should be able to use the information in their work with clients from different cultural backgrounds. The final group of individuals who would benefit from the information provided in the book is educators. Overall, Constantine and all those who have contributed chapters provide a great deal of information for psychologists who are practitioners, educators, and researchers. This is an excellent book for individuals who are in the position of responding to the mental health needs of diverse individuals, and it will become even more relevant as the diversity of the population continues to increase.

Abstract = {In an effort to investigate the students' experience of African American Student Network (AFAM), we conducted a pilot study with 5 AFAM students. The pilot study focused on understanding AFAM through the eyes of the students. In-depth semi-structured interviews and an adaptation of interpretive phenomenological analysis were included to capture to students' experiences. The pilot study included two males and three females from 19-23 years old. Participation in AFAM ranged from 1 to 4 semesters. Year in school ranged from sophomore to senior. Three participants identified as African American, one identified as biracial, and one identified as bicultural (being a more recent African immigrant but also feeling connected to African American culture). The pilot study was based in qualitative research rooted in phenomenology—the study of the "lived" experience of a phenomenon— which emphasizes the in-depth exploration of the experiences of a small number of research participants. Seven themes were identified in students' experiences of AFAM: (a) a safe space, (b) connectedness, (c) validation, (d) resilience, (e) intellectual stimulation, (f) empowerment, and (g) a home base. Quotes exemplify the richness of each theme. The results of the pilot study provide some empirical evidence for how AFAM is meeting the needs of African American students on our campus.

Abstract = {Background: The call to recruit and retain teachers of color in urban high-minority schools is based on an assumption of a cultural match with students. Yet new teachers of color may find themselves challenged by students with whom they are supposedly culturally matched. Although past research has examined recruitment, preservice, and veteran experiences of teachers of color, little research investigates the critical novice phase. Purpose: The study examines the induction experiences of new teachers of color in urban high-minority schools as they negotiate challenges about cultural identifications. The research questions ask: How, if at all, do new teachers of color experience sociocultural challenges from students? If they do experience such challenges, how do the teachers respond to them in practice? Participants: Fifteen new teachers of color working in urban high-minority secondary schools in different subject domains in California. The participants include Latino, African American, Asian, Filipino, and biracial new teachers. Research Design: This article draws from cross-case analysis of case studies of new teachers of color on the theme of responses to sociocultural challenges. Data Collection/Analysis: Data are from teacher interviews, classroom observations, and focus groups, reflecting 3 years in the teachers’ lives. We coded the data on three levels: preliminary coding of sociocultural challenges, pattern coding of responses to challenges, and cross-case analysis. Findings: The study findings complicate the limited conception of cultural match currently dominating policy and research rhetoric about teachers of color. The authors highlight a surprising new form of “practice shock” that the novices of color experienced when students of color questioned the teachers’ cultural identifications, finding them culturally suspect. The study also challenges the prevailing description of novices’ response to practice shock as moving toward more control-focused teaching. Instead, most novices at times took up the challenges as teachable moments and opportunities to broaden student conceptions. Teachers drew on “emergent multicultural capital” to negotiate challenges in ways that shaped teaching practice. Conclusions: The literature on novices, drawn from a White-dominant sample, has not included a discussion of sociocultural conflicts or the supports needed in induction years for teachers of color. The study revealed the lack of support that many of the teachers felt in relation to negotiating sociocultural issues. The study raises issues about targeted induction support for teachers of color that educators and researchers should consider as they seek to diversify the workforce.

Abstract = {Using data from a biracial community sample of adolescents, the present study examined trajectories of alcohol use and abuse over a 15-year period, from adolescence into young adulthood, as well as the extent to which these trajectories were differentially predicted by coping and enhancement motives for alcohol use among the 2 groups. Coping and enhancement motivations (M. L. Cooper, 1994) refer to the strategic use of alcohol to regulate negative and positive emotions, respectively. Results showed that Black and White youth follow distinct alcohol trajectories from adolescence into young adulthood and that these trajectories are differentially rooted in the regulation of negative and positive emotions. Among Black drinkers, coping motives assessed in adolescence more strongly forecast differences in alcohol involvement into their early 30s, whereas enhancement motives more strongly forecast differences among White drinkers. Results of the present study suggest that different models may be needed to account for drinking behavior among Blacks and Whites and that different approaches may prove maximally effective in reducing heavy or problem drinking among the 2 groups.

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined the relation of individual-level perceived discrimination to mortality in a biracial, population-based sample. Methods: Participants were 4154 older adults from the Chicago Health and Aging Project who underwent up to 2 interviews over 4.5 years. Perceived discrimination was measured at baseline, and vital status was obtained at each followup and verified through the National Death Index. Results: During follow-up, 1166 deaths occurred. Participants reporting more perceived discrimination had a higher relative risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 1.09). This association was independent of differences in negative affect or chronic illness and appeared to be stronger among Whites than among Blacks (Whites: HR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.20; Blacks: HR = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.99, 1.07). Secondary analyses revealed that the relation to mortality was related to discriminatory experiences of a more demeaning nature and that racial differences were no longer significant when the sample was restricted to respondents interviewed by someone of the same race. Conclusions: Perceived discrimination was associated with increased mortality risk in a general population of older adults.

Abstract = {Purpose: The incidence of seizures within 24 h of acute stroke has not been studied extensively. We aimed to establish the incidence of acute post stroke seizures in a biracial cohort and to determine whether acute seizure occurrence differs by race/ethnicity, stroke subtype, and/or stroke localization. Methods: We identified all stroke cases between July 1993 and June 1994 and in 1999 within the population of the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan region. Patients with a prior history of seizures/epilepsy were excluded from analysis. Results: A total of 6,044 strokes without a history of seizure(s) were identified; 190 (3.1%) had seizures within the first 24 h of stroke onset. Of ICH/SAH patients, 8.4% had a seizure within the first 24 h of stroke onset (p ≤ 0.0001 vs. all other stroke subtype). Of the patients with ischemic stroke, we observed higher incidence of seizures in cardioembolic versus small or large vessel ischemic (p = 0.02) strokes. Patients with seizures experienced higher mortality than patients without seizures (p < 0.001) but seizures were not an independent risk factor of mortality at 30 days after stroke. Independent risk factors for seizure development included hemorrhagic stroke, younger age, and prestroke Rankin score of ≥1. Race/ethnicity or localization of the ischemic stroke did not influence the risk for seizure development in the studied population. Discussion: The overall incidence of acute seizures after stroke was 3.1%, with a higher incidence seen in hemorrhagic stroke, younger patients, and those presenting with higher prestroke Rankin scores. Acute seizures were associated with a higher mortality at 30 days after stroke. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This study explored influences on racial identity of mixed race youth who identified themselves to be part of mixed African (Black) and European (White) origin. Research questions emerged following a review of the literature identifying the ways in which views of self, family, peers and society impact youth and their racial identification. Eight in-depth interviews employing the Long Interview Method were conducted, transcribed and coded to determine themes. Family influences emerged as playing a significant role in biracial identity formation. Three major themes were identified: (1) level of parental awareness and understanding of race issues; (2) impact of family structure; and (3) communication and willingness to talk about race issues. Implications for researchers and social work practitioners working with this population are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this chapter I cover both the determinants of racial identification among multiracial youth and its implications for their mental health, achievement, and self-esteem. The goals for this chapter are, first, to describe the literature on identity development among biracials as a way of challenging the notion of race as a single and fixed aspect of identity. This first goal leads logically to the second goal, which is to examine the developmental implications of flexible racial identity. Understanding these implications for multiracial youth may even shed some light on the racial identity development of monoracial youth. In keeping with my two goals, I organize the literature into two sections: one on identity development, and the other on the impact of identity on child and adolescent outcomes. Within the section on identity development, I include three subsections. The first describes general theories of multiracial identity development, the second provides details about specific race combinations (part-Black, part-Asian, part-Hispanic, part-American Indian), and the third explores the connections between context and racial identification. In the section on the impact of identity on developmental outcomes, I discuss the distinction between ancestry and racial identity for multiracial youth and explore the ways that context mediates the identification- development link among multiracial youth.

Abstract = {This chapter looks at a specific case to discuss sexual attraction in the supervisory relationship. Dr. Vasquez is a 42-year-old Hispanic woman who has worked as an assistant professor in a Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs-accredited counselor education program at State University for 4 years. As a part of her teaching responsibilities, she supervises 10 mental health counseling internship students enrolled in the master's program. In addition to facilitating the group supervision element of these students on a weekly basis, she also meets with each student on a bimonthly basis. Nicolas, one of the master's students supervised by Dr. Vasquez, is a 35-year-old Caucasian man who is in his last semester of his master's degree. Unbeknownst to Dr. Vasquez, Nicolas is attracted to her. On a cognitive level, Nicholas is aware of his attraction and begrudgingly admits that there can be no relationship between the two of them. On an emotional level, however, Nicolas often finds himself fantasizing over how such a relationship might evolve if it were ever to come to fruition. In the 7th week of Nicolas' second semester of internship, he was assigned Rosie as a client. Rosie, a 29-year-old biracial woman, who has one child by a prior marriage, sought counseling for reoccurring substance dependence to cocaine and alcohol. In the sixth counseling session, Rosie began to share more intimate details of her recent drug and alcohol binge episode, most notably that during that time she engaged in multiple sexual encounters including one with a woman. In the session, Nicolas explored details of the binge episode, how Rosie felt about the events, and how it felt for Rosie to discuss the issue with Nicolas. Rosie also shared her concerns about her interest in pornography and an apparent developing addiction to Internet porn. Throughout the session, Nicolas got the impression that Rosie was deliberately sharing explicit details in order to arouse him, and as a result, he struggled to find the right words for Rosie. In supervision, Nicolas shared with Dr. Vasquez the events of the session with Rosie and his struggle with how to respond appropriately. There are multiple connections taking place in this case study that need to be attended to in supervision. The attraction that Nicolas is feeling toward his supervisor, Dr. Vasquez, is of primary importance in that it is evident during portions of Nicolas's conversation with Dr. Vasquez about his client's sexual behavior.

Abstract = {The U.S. population has witnessed considerable social, cultural, and demographic changes. Youth of racial and ethnic minorities, including those of color, immigrant youth, and biracial youth, experience a variety of internal and external challenges. There are numerous unique characteristics, potential problems, and social needs. These challenges are related to a need to define identities in a society that is many times harsh in response to social dimensions outside of the mainstream. Considerable attention must be focused on providing counseling services to racial and ethnic minority youth. Some issues that are pertinent to working with these populations include racial and ethnic identity development, isolation, career dreams, and academic and behavioral concerns (Harris, 2002; Herring, 1992). The professional helper's multicultural knowledge, awareness, and skills in working with people from diverse backgrounds are critical to effective counseling. It is clear from research that racial and ethnic minorities are more vulnerable to social, emotional, and academic problems and that limited support systems are available to racial and ethnic minority youth (Esquivel & Keitel, 1990). This chapter addresses stressors encountered by these minority youth and issues pertinent to counseling. A case study is provided as well as suggestions for prevention and intervention strategies.

Abstract = {In a culture that stratifies human differences, it is inevitable that anxiety about difference would be the source of much suffering. The power distortions that lie at the root of this suffering are manifest in relationships, from the most tangential to those that are deeply intimate. Moreover, the anxieties endemic to a race-based culture have the potential to thwart our most earnest efforts to make and maintain good connection. To adopt the feminist perspective, that the personal is political, is to acknowledge that no relationship can remain unscathed when power and value are differentially accorded based on racial group membership. Three examples from clinical practice will be used to illustrate how racial anxiety impedes movement toward authenticity, mutuality, and empowerment in intimate relationships. In these examples, three biracial women who identify as black navigate the racial stratifications that contaminate the inevitable conflicts in their relationships with parents, mentors, and lovers. Because of the multilayered anxieties stemming from living and loving in a racially stratified culture, conflicts, which might otherwise be the source of growth and deeper connection, become rigidified and immobilizing. In addition to examining the debilitating impact of racial anxiety, the presentation will highlight the relational processes that facilitate healing, resilience, and mutual empowerment.

Methods: The study sample (N = 618, mean age = 15.5, SD = 1.2) represented the population of residents in the Missouri Division of Youth Services (DYS) who had initiated marijuana and nicotine use. Results: As hypothesized, African-American youth were significantly more likely to initiate marijuana use before cigarette use. Over one-third of African Americans reported initiating marijuana before cigarettes (37.9%), compared to less than one-quarter of youth in the other ethnic groups (Caucasian = 17.3%, Latino/Latina = 21.7%, Biracial/Other = 20.8%). Further, multinomial simulation and logistic regression models revealed that African-American youth were significantly more likely than other ethnic groups to initiate marijuana before cigarettes (Adjusted OR = 3.53, CI = 1.92-6.46). Conclusions/Scientific Significance: Findings suggest that the hypothesized gateway sequence may not apply equally well to African-Americans, and that prevention efforts based on this theory may need to be amended for these youth.

Abstract = {Relational Dialectics Theory (RDT) is a theory of the meaning-making between relationship parties that emerges from the interplay of competing discourses. "Discourses" are systems of meaning that are uttered whenever we make intelligible utterances aloud with others (or in our heads when we hold internal conversations). In its broadest sense, a discourse is a cultural system of meaning that circulates among a group's members and which makes our talk sensical. For example, in the United States the discourse of individualism helps us to understand and value an utterance such as, "I need to find myself first before I commit to a serious relationship with another person." Systems of meaning can be more localized, as well. For example, when partners refer to one another with a favorite idiom, such as "chickadee," they might be invoking a core meaning system about themselves as a biracial couple. Whenever we communicate, we are invoking--often indirectly and by implication--multiple systems of meaning. These discourses often compete, oppose, and struggle with one another, however. We often hear these discursive struggles when people talk. Consider this statement about dating by a college student: "Well, I'm kinda, like, seeing him, but we're not, ya know, serious." This utterance displays a struggle in meaning. It draws on a discourse of connection or closeness ("I'm seeing him"), yet it also draws on a discourse of autonomy or distance ("We're not serious"). Relational Dialectics Theory focuses on the struggles in meaning--the discursive tensions--that frequent interpersonal communication. However, the position of the theory is not that competing discourses are negative. Instead, they are the heart of the meaning-making enterprise. The central claim of RDT is that such discursive tensions are both inevitable and necessary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Adopted children, especially those in biracial adoption situations, may grow up unconnected. This is an unfortunate situation, and this book is a laudable attempt to correct this oversight. As such, the topic of this book is timely, and it will be useful for many families and the social workers, counselors, and psychologists who work with these families. The main concern of the book is the sociogenealogical connectedness of children. Separation of children from their biological families is an issue that needs to be addressed by additional research, and the book makes a strong case for that. It also integrates sociogenealogical connectedness with accepted theories of development and provides both parents and mental health professionals with valuable ideas.

We find that while many multiracials subsequently identify as monoracials, sizable numbers of monoracials also subsequently become multiracials. Native American-whites appear to have the least stable identification. We find strong support that socioeconomic status, gender, and physical appearance shape the direction of change for multiracials, and that black biracials are especially compelled to identify as monoracial blacks.

In this discussion I consider several influences on the contemporary project of deconstructing racism and the concept of racialized subjectivity. This discussion applauds the turn in Suchet's work toward self-examination in a consideration of the experience of race and racism. Suchet's work moves the debates about racialized subjectivities into a deeper and more complex understanding of all the ways in which identifications and attachments cross race and class lines for many individuals. This discussion focuses on Suchet's treatment of the power of hybridic and biracial identifications, beginning with autobiographical material from Suchet's own childhood in South Africa. In this discussion of "Unraveling Whiteness" I integrate psychoanalytic concepts of enigmatic signification (the work of Laplanche) into a discussion of early attachment, and relational configurations with children and nonparental caretakers. The question of trauma or potential transformation in interracial experience is discussed, and some distinctions between American and South African experience are considered.

Abstract = {Objective: Although the long-term health risks associated with obesity in older adults have been well documented, less is known about the psychological consequences. The current study examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and subsequent depressive symptoms. The authors anticipated that BMI would predict depressive symptoms, and that this relationship would be greater among women, individuals of higher socioeconomic status (SES), and white subjects. Methods: A three-year longitudinal epidemiological design was employed. Participants were obtained from a biracial sample of community-dwelling older adults (N = 2406) and were interviewed in their home by trained interviewers. A comprehensive survey assessed age, gender, race, SES (education and income), and health functioning variables. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. BMI was derived from self-reported weight and height. Results: BMI was found to predict depressive symptoms. Contrary to predictions, the influence of BMI on depressive symptoms was greater for African Americans than whites and, in particular, African Americans with less education. There were no sex differences. Conclusion: Among older adults, BMI was associated with depressive symptoms although the effect size was small. Factors contributing to this relationship may differ from those observed in younger populations, for example, health functioning may play a larger role. Obesity appears to have the most adverse impact on those who are most likely to be overweight, lower SES African Americans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Sample ethnic subgroups included European American, Latino/Hispanic, African American, Asian American, Native American, Pacific Islander, and Biracial/Multiracial. Excellent reliability statistics were obtained for the full sample (alpha = .93, N = 2,722) and various ethnic subgroups (alpha = .93 to .95, n = 44 to 1,383). Correlations between self-efficacy scores and measures of condom use were similar in magnitude to effect sizes reported in research involving civilian populations (r = .18 to .34). Significant differences in self-efficacy scores for groups of condom users (e.g., consistent and nonconsistent users) for the full sample of men and ethnic subgroups provided further support for construct validity (p < .05). Study findings support the reliability and validity of the condom self-efficacy measure in this population and indicate its usefulness and the need for investigating its psychometric properties in other populations.

Abstract = {Interracial/interethnic marriage in America is a barometer of racial/ethnic relations and intergroup social distance. Using data from the 5-percent Public Use Microdata Sample of the 1990 and 2000 censuses, we interpret trends in intermarriage in light of new assimilation theory, recent changes in racial classification, and rapid demographic changes in American society. Our results indicate that changes in marital assimilation have taken on momentum of their own; that is, America's growing biracial population has fueled the growth of interracial marriages with whites. Analyses also shed new light on the effects of rapid immigration, rising cohabitation, and educational upgrading on intermarriage patterns, and yield both continuities and departures from the past. Historic patterns of racial/ethnic differences in intermarriage persist--Hispanics and American Indians are most likely to marry whites, followed closely by Asian Americans. African Americans are least likely to marry whites. Yet, the 1990s brought significant increases in intermarriage between blacks and whites; large increases in cohabitation did not offset the growth of racially-mixed marriages. The past decade also ushered in unprecedented declines in intermarriage with whites and large increases in marriage between native- and foreign-born co-ethnics among Hispanics and Asian Americans. The role of educational attainment in the out-marriage patterns of Hispanics and Asian Americans was also reinforced. Any evidence of differential growth in African American white marriages among the highly educated African American population was weak. If intermarriage is our guide, any shifting, blurring, or crossing of racial/ethnic boundaries represent uncommonly weak mechanisms for breaking down existing racial barriers to black-white union formation.

Abstract = {Student retention continues to be a vexing problem for all colleges and universities. In spite of the money spent on creating programs and services to help retain students until they achieve their academic and personal goals, and graduate, the figures have not improved over time. This is particularly true for minority students, who have a greater attrition rate than majority students. Demographic information shows that the minority population in the United States is growing at a faster rate than the majority. It is imperative that educational institutions find ways to help improve retention rates for all students but particularly minority students. Retention rates should not differ appreciably among different racial/ethnic groups. The Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory & Practice is the only scholarly, peer-reviewed journal devoted solely to college student retention. It has published many articles on minority student retention, and this topic continues to garner much attention. This book is a compilation of the very best of these articles, selected on the basis of reviews by a cadre of experts in the education field. The articles discuss African American, Latino/Latina, Asian and Asian Pacific, Native American, and biracial students, and institutional commitments to retaining a diverse student population. For those interested in this vital area, the collection will teach and inspire them to achieve greater heights and pay additional attention to retaining minority students in our colleges and universities.

Dong and colleagues evaluate the mortality related to elder self-neglect and abuse in a large biracial cohort of community-dwelling persons aged 65 years or older who were followed up for a median of 6.9 years. Confirming prior work, the number of reported cases of self-neglect dwarfed that of abuse by a ratio of nearly 14 to 1. While both elder self-neglect and abuse were independently associated with mortality, the short-term effects of self-neglect were particularly pronounced, with an early 6-fold elevation in the risk of death within 1 year. Such elevations in risk are usually reserved for acute and highly morbid medical conditions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or hip fracture and suggest that a report of elder self-neglect should be considered a medical emergency, warranting immediate referral for diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract = {Poverty can shorten the average person's life span by up to 10 years. Socioeconomic status (SES) and its relation to stroke mortality has been extensively investigated, and lower SES has been associated with a higher mortality after stroke in Europe and the United States. In addition, poorer SES has been associated with a higher prevalence of stroke risk factors and lower poststroke quality of life. Within our large, biracial population, we found that 39% of the racial disparity in stroke incidence for blacks was associated with poorer SES. Stroke incidence increased as community poverty increased, suggesting a dose-response. Although SES may explain 39% of the racial disparity in stroke incidence, the remainder is still unexplained. Unfortunately, we cannot explain the contribution of hypertension, smoking, and other traditional risk factors to the excess risk for blacks, because we do not have reliable estimates of risk factor prevalences for the population subgroups, as we do for census-based socioeconomic variables. There is likely significant overlap between the prevalence of risk factors and SES, and there may also be differences in medical control of risk factors associated with SES.

Abstract = {Objective: This study examined two potential mechanisms linking violence exposure and health risk behavior among adolescents in psychiatric care: sensation seeking and coping with stress through escape behavior. Method: Male (59%) and female adolescents (N=251), ages 12 to 19 years, from diverse ethnic backgrounds (61% African American, 19% white, 12% Latino, 8% biracial or other ethnicity) completed a computer-administered survey assessing study variables from 1999-2004. Overall clinic consent rate was 41%. Age and gender were included in all analyses. Results: Consistent with the literature on nonpsychiatric samples, violence exposure was associated with both increased substance use and sexual risk taking. Violence exposure was not associated with motivation to engage in risk behavior as a means of escape, although motivation to cope through escape was associated with a greater likelihood of substance use. Sensation seeking was related to substance use and sexual risk taking among all adolescents and with violence exposure primarily within male adolescents. Conclusions: Clinical interventions should promote adaptive coping strategies that emphasize maintaining healthy behavior, effective problem solving skills, and stress management techniques.

Abstract = {A recent study reported that mortality from stroke in children and adolescents decreased by 58% from 1979 to 1998, although it wasn't clear if the case fatality or the incidence of stroke in this age group is decreasing. We report trends of stroke incidence and case fatality in children and adolescents within a large biracial population. The study involved collection of all strokes in the study population between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 1989, July 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994, and January 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999, at all of the regional hospitals serving the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky population (only the children's hospital in 1988). Study nurses reviewed the medical records of all inpatients with stroke-related discharge diagnoses and abstracted relevant data. A study physician reviewed each abstract to determine whether a stroke or transient ischemic attack had occurred. A total of 54 strokes occurred in children or adolescents younger than 20 years during the three study periods (30% African American, 70% Caucasian, and 56% female). The overall incidence rate of all strokes in children younger than 15 years was 6.4/100,000 in 1999, a nonsignificant increase when compared to 1988. The 30-day case-fatality rates were 18% in 1988-1989, 9% in 1993-1994, and 9% in 1999. We found that the incidence of strokes in children has been stable over the past 10 years. The previously reported nationwide decrease in overall stroke mortality in children might be due to decreasing case fatality after stroke and not decreasing stroke incidence. Based on our data, we conservatively estimated that approximately 3000 children less than 20 years old would have a stroke in the United States in 2004.

Abstract = {Objective: To determine whether metabolic syndrome is an independent predictor of decline in mobility in an elderly community sample. DESIGN: Biracial community-based prospective cohort study. Setting: Urban and rural areas of central North Carolina. Participants: One thousand two hundred twenty-nine older African Americans and whites, mean age 77.0, who were participants in the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Measurements: Sociodemographic data and data on mobility (a subset of items from the Rosow-Breslau scale), depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), self-report of medical conditions, body mass index, cognitive function (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire), blood pressure, height, and waist circumference. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose were available from blood samples. Metabolic syndrome was calculated for subjects with complete data. Results: Twenty-nine percent of the sample met criteria for metabolic syndrome. In bivariate analyses, age, sex, race, education, cognitive impairment, depression, impairment in mobility, history of stroke and heart disease, and metabolic syndrome at baseline were associated with a decline in mobility 4 years later. Regression analysis controlling for the above variables demonstrated that metabolic syndrome persisted as an independent and highly significant predictor of decline in mobility. Conclusion: These findings suggest that metabolic syndrome may be a distinct risk factor for mobility decline in community-dwelling older people.

Abstract = {The purpose of this interpretive descriptive study was to describe how eight Black-White couples with school-aged children constructed their interracial family identity through developmental transitions and interpreted race to their children. Within- and across-case data analytic strategies were used to identify commonalities and variations in how Black men and White women in couple relationships formed their family identities over time. Coming together was the core theme described by the Black-White couples as they negotiated the process of forming a family identity. Four major tasks in the construction of interracial family identity emerged: (a) understanding and resolving family of origin chaos and turmoil, (b) transcending Black-White racial history, (c) articulating the interracial family's racial standpoint, and (d) explaining race to biracial children across the developmental stages.

Abstract = {Context: It is currently not known whether dietary intakes of folate and vitamins B12 and B6, co-factors in the methylation of homocysteine, protect against Alzheimer's disease. Objective: To examine the association between risk of incident Alzheimer's disease and dietary intakes of folate, vitamin B-12, and vitamin B-6. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Geographically defined biracial Chicago community. Participants: 1,041 residents, aged 65 years and older, initially free of Alzheimer's disease and followed a median 3.9 years for the development of incident disease. Main Outcome Measure: Probable Alzheimer's disease identified through structured clinical neurological evaluation using standardized criteria. Results: A total of 162 persons developed incident Alzheimer's disease during follow-up. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, education, cognitive activities, APOE-ε4, and dietary intakes of vitamin E in food and total niacin, there was no association between risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and quintiles of folate intake or of vitamin B-12 intake. The adjusted odds ratio was 1.6 (95% confidence interval: 0.5, 5.2) for persons in the highest quintile of total folate intake (median of 752.7 μg/d) compared with persons in the lowest quintile of intake (median, 202.8 μg/d). Compared with persons in the first quintile of total vitamin B-12 intake (median, 3.1 μg/d) the odds ratio was 0.6 (95% confidence interval: 0.2, 1.6) for persons in the fifth quintile of intake (median, 20.6 μg/d). Intake of vitamin B-6 was not associated with incident Alzheimer's disease after control for dietary intakes of vitamin E and total niacin. Conclusion: Dietary intakes of folate, vitamin B-12, or vitamin B-6 do not appear to be associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract = {Righteous Indignation uncovers what motivated conservative, mostly middle-class southern farmers to revolt against the Democratic Party by embracing the radical, even Revolutionary biracial politics of the People's Party in the 1890s. While other historians of Populism have looked to economics, changing markets, or various ideals to explain this phenomenon, in Righteous Indignation, Joe Creech posits evangelical religion as the motive force behind the shift. This illuminating study shows how Populists wove their political and economic reforms into a grand cosmic narrative pitting the forces of God and democracy against those of Satan and tyranny, and energizing their movement with a sacred sense of urgency. This book also unpacks the southern Protestants' complicated approach to political and economic questions, and addresses broader issues about protest movements, race relations, and the American South.

Abstract = {This second edition of Preventing Prejudice: A Guide for Counselors, Educators, and Parents has been completely revised and expanded to provide the most up-to-date and extensive coverage of prejudice and racism currently available. The new edition of this text not only presents a comprehensive overview of prejudice and racism but also includes practical tools for combating prejudice development in children, adolescents, and adults. Key features: (a) Stresses the Role of Authority Figures: The text emphasizes the critical role counselors, educators, and parents must play in the fight against prejudice and racism. Pragmatic in nature, the book includes strategies that can be used by parents, teachers, and counselors in working to reduce prejudice across the life span; (b) Encourages Healthy Identity Development: The text reviews an extensive body of empirical research on the interplay among identity development, prejudice, and mental health. The book summarizes racial, biracial, multiracial, and gay and lesbian identity models. A major new theory highlights the link of multicultural personality development to prejudice-free attitudes and behavior as well as to quality of life; and (c) Offers Field-Tested Tools: The text provides concrete, easy-to-implement exercises on preventing prejudice and increasing multicultural awareness. In addition, the book includes a review of tests and instruments that measure prejudice and a list of films and books that serves as a resource guide for readers. The authors draw on theory and research in social, developmental, counseling, and cross-cultural psychology as well as in sociology and education. This text is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on prejudice and racism in the fields of multicultural education, counseling, social work, developmental psychology, and human development. It is also a resource for teachers, counselors, administrators, managers, and parents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (cover)},

Abstract = {Presents the case of Paul, a biracial man in his early 20s, whose fears of losing control (e.g., killing his mother while sleepwalking, unintentionally molesting young girls) were indicative of a high level of anxiety. The case study describes the initial sessions of building rapport and finding the relaxation response, to the second phase of dealing with Paul's social anxiety of being with people. Throughought, the therapist's feelings of protectiveness toward Paul are addressed. The third phase of therapy allowed Paul to remember and deal with issues surrounding his parents' divorce and his fear of hurting his mother. In the final phase, Paul was virtually symptom free and was able to share his feelings with the therapist. The author concludes by discussing the importance of sharing and self-disclosure for male therapists working with male clients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Cross-sectionally, lower trunk muscle attenuation (higher fat infiltration) has been associated with poorer physical function in older adults. We hypothesize that lower trunk muscle attenuation will be associated with lower functional capacity 3 years later and that back pain status will moderate this relationship. Methods: The study sample consisted of a biracial cohort of well functioning men (739) and women (788) aged 70-79 years from the Pittsburgh site of the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study. Computed tomography was used to measure trunk muscle area and attenuation of the lumbar paraspinal, lateral abdominal, and rectus abdominus muscles at baseline. The Health ABC Physical Performance Battery (usual and narrow walk, chair stands, and standing balance) was used to measure functional capacity at the first and fourth annual clinic visits. Results: Regardless of back pain status, average trunk muscle attenuation (but not muscle area) was positively associated with overall physical performance, particularly balance (p < .01), in a fully adjusted model. The association between trunk attenuation and functional capacity was significantly stronger in participants with at least moderate back pain in the year prior to baseline (p < .05 for interaction; attenuation × back pain). Participants with moderate to extreme back pain had a greater decline in function over time (p < .05). Conclusions: Older adults with poorer trunk muscle composition (higher fat infiltration) exhibit reduced functional capacity, especially balance, 3 years later. Improving trunk muscle composition may be an important yet overlooked approach to maintain function and potentially reduce balance impairments, particularly in persons with a history of back pain.

Abstract = {Objective: The authors examined racial differences in cognitive decline (CD) and the role of education and literacy in mediating this relationship. Methods: The relationship between race and CD was examined over a 3-year period in a biracial community sample of older adults (N = 3,097) living in North Carolina. Results: African Americans, as compared with White participants, had fewer years of education and were more likely to be assessed by the interviewer as not literate. Race predicted CD such that African Americans had higher rates than Whites. When education and literacy were entered into the analysis, the association between race and CD, although remaining statistically significant, was reduced and was of relatively weak magnitude. Also, physical functioning problems also predicted CD and were found to be greater in African Americans than in Whites. Conclusions: Education and literacy may be protective factors against CD. Socioeconomic disadvantages experienced by older African Americans in the South early in life, leading to poorer educational opportunities, may explain, in part, the increased rates of CD in older African Americans versus Whites.

Abstract = {The current study explored essential themes of racial identity development among 10 self-identified multiracial adults from a variety of racial backgrounds. Participants were interviewed using a semistructured protocol, and the interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then coded for themes by research team members. Four primary themes were identified: encounters with racism, reference group orientation, the "chameleon" experience, and the importance of social context in identity development. A number of subthemes also were identified. Although several of the themes mirrored those associated with contemporary biracial and multiracial identity development models, new themes centering on the adoption of multiple self-labels reflecting both monoracial and multiracial backgrounds emerged as well. Implications of the findings for future research and practice are identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Participants had brief cognitive testing three times at approximately 3-year intervals. At baseline, information about early life household and county socioeconomic level was collected. In mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, race, and education, both early life household and county socioeconomic levels were positively associated with baseline level of cognition but unrelated to cognitive decline.

We examined substance use disorder (SUD) prevalences and comorbidities among AAs, NHs/PIs, and MRs (N = 4572) in a behavioral health electronic health record database. DSM-IV diagnoses among patients aged 1-90 years who accessed behavioral healthcare from 11 sites were systematically captured: SUD, anxiety, mood, personality, adjustment, childhood-onset, cognitive/dementia, dissociative, eating, factitious, impulse-control, psychotic/schizophrenic, sleep, and somatoform diagnoses. Of all patients, 15.0% had a SUD. Mood (60%), anxiety (31.2%), adjustment (30.9%), and disruptive (attention deficit-hyperactivity, conduct, oppositional defiant, disruptive behavior diagnosis, 22.7%) diagnoses were more common than others (psychotic 14.2%, personality 13.3%, other childhood-onset 11.4%, impulse-control 6.6%, cognitive 2.8%, eating 2.2%, somatoform 2.1%). Less than 1% of children aged < 12 years had SUD. Cannabis diagnosis was the primary SUD affecting adolescents aged 12e17. MRs aged 35-49 years had the highest prevalence of cocaine diagnosis. Controlling for age at first visit, sex, treatment setting, length of treatment, and number of comorbid diagnoses, NHs/PIs and MRs were about two times more likely than AAs to have ≥ 2 SUDs. Regardless of race/ethnicity, personality diagnosis was comorbid with SUD. NHs/PIs with a mood diagnosis had elevated odds of having SUD. Findings present the most comprehensive patterns of mental diagnoses available for treatment-seeking AAs, NHs/PIs, and MRs in the real-world medical setting. In-depth research is needed to elucidate intraracial and interracial differences in treatment needs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is present the case of WR. WR is a 32-year-old, adopted, biracial attorney with an eight-year history of multiple sclerosis (MS), bipolar disorder, and alcohol and marijuana abuse. He has been out of work for two years, relying on his adoptive mother for financial support. Crisis loomed when she threatened to stop paying rent. Fearing abandonment and homelessness, he vowed "I have to take care of myself" which, as it always has, proved difficult for him to do. WR traces his troubles to the summer of 1996, during a summer internship at a law firm. He developed MS, was hospitalized twice, stabilized with steroids, and then maintained on interferon. He had flares in 2001, 2002, and 2003, but has been neurologically asymptomatic since that time. His bipolar disorder emerged during treatment for MS. Prior to 1995, his psychiatric history had been notable only for alcohol and marijuana abuse, which had begun depression, with three hypomanic episodes. Working with a series of psychiatric residents, WR tried a series of mood stabilizers and antidepressants. He had the most, but still limited, success with lamotrigine and bupropion. He has often required a third medication for sleep and anxiety. He prefers clonazepam, which produces less morning sedation. His treaters have preferred olanzapine or quetiapine because of concern with his substance use. He controls his alcohol consumption with naltrexone, which produces a surprisingly immediate reduction in his interest in alcohol. Although his MS and bipolar disorder have been quiescent recently, they damaged his already injured psyche. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Associations between trunk muscle composition and physical function have not been examined previously in older adults. We hypothesized that lower trunk muscle area and attenuation (higher fat infiltration) are associated with decreased functional capacity. Methods: The study sample consisted of a biracial cohort of well functioning men (739) and women (788) aged 70-79 from the Pittsburgh site of the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study. Computed tomography was used to measure trunk muscle area (cm²) and muscle attenuation (Hounsfield Unit [HU]) of the following muscle groups: lumbar paraspinals, lateral abdominals, and rectus abdominis. An average score was calculated for both trunk area and attenuation. The Health ABC Physical Performance Battery (PPB) and its individual components (usual and narrow walk, chair stands, and standing balance) were used to measure functional capacity. Results: Linear regression analyses adjusting for demographic factors, height, body fat, thigh muscle composition, disease status, and low back pain (LBP) found that average trunk muscle area was not associated with any element of functional capacity (p > .10), whereas average trunk muscle attenuation was positively associated with the Health ABC Physical Performance Battery (p < .05) and chair stands (p < .001). Participants reporting higher LBP severity during the past year had lower muscle attenuation (p < .001 for trend), but there was no difference in average trunk muscle area according to LBP status. Conclusions: Findings suggest a link between trunk muscle composition and history of LBP as well as reduced functional capacity in older adults. Improving trunk muscle quality may lead to reduced LBP severity and improved functional status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In a biracial sample of community dwelling elders (n=4162, the Duke EPESE), African-Americans endorsed more items than Whites on a standardized depression scale, the CES-D, in unadjusted, cross-sectional analyses. However, indices of socioeconomic status (e.g., education and problems meeting needs) were found to mediate the relationship between race and depression. When these socioeconomic variables were included in cross-sectional analyses, the association between depressive symptoms and race reversed such that Whites were significantly more likely to endorse depressive symptoms than African-Americans. Further, whereas in unadjusted, longitudinal analyses, race was unrelated to changes in depressive symptoms over time, with the inclusion of the socioeconomic variables Whites were found to endorse more depressive symptoms than African-Americans. We conclude that socioeconomic variables influence the size and direction of racial differences in the endorsement of depressive symptoms in community dwelling elders.

The rate of cognitive decline among persons in the lop filth of total folate intake (median, 742 μg/d) was more than twice that of those in the lowest fifth of intake (median, 186 μg/d), a statistically significant difference of 0.02 standardized unit per year (P=.002). A faster rate of cognitive, decline was also associated with high folate intake from food (P for trend = .04) and with folate vitamin supplementation of more than 400 μg/d compared with nonusers (β= -.03, P<.001). High total B₁₂ intake was associated with slower cognitive decline only among the oldest participants. Conclusions: High intake of folate may be associated with cognitive decline in older persons. These unexpected findings call for further study of the cognitive implications of high levels of dietary folate in older populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the contribution of preinjury differences and potential biases in outcome measurement in explaining outcome differences between white and African American persons with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: Prospective, 2 group longitudinal study with retrospective self-assessment of preinjury status. Setting: Inpatient and outpatient TBI rehabilitation program. Participants: Ninety-four persons with moderate and severe TBI (55 whites and 39 African Americans) who provided data on both preinjury status and 1-year outcome. Measures: Community Integration Questionnaire, aggression and depression subscales of Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory-Revised, Satisfaction With Life Scale, other questions on demographic and social status; all measures were selected by a biracial focus group. Results: Whites and African Americans did not differ significantly on demographic factors except gender; nor on retrospective, self-reported preinjury status on any of the outcome measures. At 1 year post- TBI, African Americans reported significantly lower social integration subscale scores than whites. African Americans may also have lost more income than did whites. All other outcome measures were comparable between groups and showed declines in community productivity, increases in depression symptoms, and lower satisfaction with life for both whites and African Americans compared to preinjury. A higher rate of change in living situation post-TBI may partially account for lower levels of social integration for African Americans. Conclusion: Whites and African Americans who are comparable prior to injury may experience generally similar outcomes, but differences in social and financial outcomes require further investigation.

Abstract = {Mishne provides an overview of cross-cultural treatments as they have developed through the last 50 years. After, she looks at the three phases of the therapeutic treatment process: (1) the beginning phase, including the referral, the assessment and the diagnosis, as well as the engagement and therapeutic alliance; (2) the middle phase of the treatment process, including a discussion of transference, countertransference and the real relationship; and (3) the end phase, which includes working through and termination of treatment. In each section, Mishne has included detailed case studies. She has drawn profiles of a Puerto Rican adolescent, a biracial preschool girl, an African American woman, an American born Hispanic woman, a 10-year-old African American boy, a European born Italian woman, a Caribbean born black woman, and a four-year-old African American girl and her mother. With each case study, she has included a discussion of the ethnic/cultural issues that are relevant during each phase of treatment with the individual client. In addition to the detailed case studies, Mishne provides the reader with clear, comprehensive descriptions of a number of the central elements of psychodynamic theories: transference, countertransference, resistance, fixation and defenses as they are defined in intersubjectivity theory and self-psychology. Mishne has demonstrated that she is aware of her own cultural identity, and she recognizes "the contributing role of the therapist's own biases, action, inactions and psychology" (p. 239) in the therapeutic process. Mishne has achieved her goal of providing clinicians with assistance in "how they listen to and finally hear what patients struggle to share" (p. xiv).

Abstract = {The association between distress proneness and cognitive decline was examined in older residents of a biracial community in Chicago. At baseline, participants completed four cognitive tests that yielded a global measure (baseline mean=101.2; standard deviation (SD)=7.8), and a brief measure of the tendency to experience negative emotions (mean=16.5; SD=6.7) based on the Neuroticism scale of the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Cognitive testing was repeated twice at three-year intervals. In mixed models that controlled age, sex, race, and education, for each point on the distress proneness scale, global cognitive score was 0.12 unit lower at baseline (p<0.001) and annual rate of decline increased by 0.01 unit (p=0.002), or about 2%. Thus, cognitive decline was about 30% faster in a person highly prone to distress (score=24, 90th percentile) compared to the one low in distress proneness (score=9, 10th percentile). This effect was unchanged after controlling for level of cognitive activity or excluding people with cognitive impairment at baseline, but it was reduced to a trend (p=0.059) after controlling for depressive symptoms. The results suggest that the tendency to experience psychological distress is associated with increased cognitive decline in old age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine which symptoms of depression are most likely to increase the risk of mortality in a biracial sample of older adults. Design: Cross-sectional and longitudinal study. Setting: Baseline and mortality follow-up in urban and rural North Carolina. Participants: Four thousand one hundred sixty-two African-American and white elders aged 65 to 105 at baseline (mean age 73). Measurements: Sociodemographic and health factors and four subscales of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (negative affect, positive affect, somatic symptoms, and interpersonal function) were determined at baseline (1986-87). Mortality was assessed over 10 years of follow-up (through 1996). Results: Fifty-one percent of the sample died over the 10-year follow-up. In controlled Cox proportional hazards modeling, those who scored lower on the positive affect scale were significantly more likely to die over the 10-year follow-up (hazard ratio = 1.12, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.18). For those who scored higher on the negative affect scale, the somatic scale, and the interpersonal scale, there was no increased risk for mortality in controlled analyses. Conclusion: These findings suggest that subjective views of well-being may be more important predictors of mortality in older adults than the classic symptoms of depression, such as negative affect and somatic symptoms.

Abstract = {Post-1965 demographic changes in the United States [US] have brought blacks, Latinos, and Asian Americans into direct conflict, raising the question of how and whether law and public policy should attempt to adjudicate conflicts among racialized minority groups. I argue in this article that for the past few decades, national political leaders in the US have promoted an official multiculturalist discourse that actually discourages Americans from naming and addressing these intergroup tensions. This discourse superficially reimagines race and nation - by moving from a biracial, black-white focus to a formal acknowledgment of multiracial difference - while refusing to acknowledge the complex interminority inequalities and antagonisms generated by this new diversity. How might we refocus national attention on the serious interminority conflicts and racial justice struggles unfolding around us? I consider resurrecting the traditional notion of racial hierarchy as a counter-narrative to official multiculturalist discourse before arguing instead for one which involves a more complex notion of "racial positionality".

Abstract = {This study uses macrostructural theory, contact theory, and group threat theory to examine how schools influence interracial friendliness and interracial conflict. Using perceived measures of both interracial friendliness and interracial conflict with data from the High School Effects Study, results from multilevel models show partial support for all three theories. As predicted by macrostructural theory, school integration raises perceptions of both friendliness and conflict, with conflict increasing more rapidly. Consistent with contact theory, segregated tracks, fewer minority teachers, less group work, and segregated extracurricular activities worsen racial relations. In support of group threat theory, evidence suggests that students are especially likely to avoid interracial contact in biracial schools with equally-sized groups. These results emphasize the importance of researching both negative and positive outcomes simultaneously when studying racial relations. The research also alerts school personnel that integration will likely result in more conflict than friendliness unless proactive steps are taken.

Abstract = {Objective: Whites of various European ethnic backgrounds usually have weak ethnic attachment and have options to identify their ethnic identity (Waters, 1990). What about children born to interracially married couples? Methods: I use 1990 Census data--the last census in which only one race could be chosen--to examine how African American-white, Latino-white, Asian American-white, and American Indian-white couples identify their children's race/ethnicity. Results: Children of African American-white couples are least likely to be identified as white, while children of Asian American-white couples are most likely to be identified as white. Intermarried couples in which the minority spouse is male, native born, or has no white ancestry are more likely to identify their children as minorities than are those in which the minority spouse is female, foreign born, or has part white ancestry. In addition, neighborhood minority concentration increases the likelihood that biracial children are identified as minorities. Conclusion. This study shows that choices of racial and ethnic identification of multiracial children are not as optional as for whites of various European ethnic backgrounds. They are influenced by race/ethnicity of the minority parent, intermarried couples' characteristics, and neighborhood compositions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Methods: The sample consisted of 2,652 Blacks and 1,630 Whites, 68 years old and older, from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP). Perceived discrimination was measured with a nine-item scale developed by Williams, Yu, Jackson, and Anderson (1997). Results: A factor analysis of the discrimination scale revealed two subscales, unfair treatment and personal rejection. Blacks scored higher on both subscales as compared with Whites. In linear regression models, race was significantly associated with higher levels of unfair treatment and personal rejection, controlling for demographic variables and socioeconomic status (SES). Each subscale was also positively related to depressive symptoms, and these effects did not vary by race.

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigated (1) the effect of octreotide-LAR (Sandostatin-LAR®Depot; Novartis) on the enteroinsular axis in a biracial cohort of severely obese adults, (2) whether octreotide suppression of insulin secretion occurs by both a direct β-cell effect and through mediating a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) response, and (3) whether differences in GLP-1 concentrations could explain racial differences in insulin concentrations. DESIGN: Prospective, open-label trial using a pre-post test design. SETTING: Single university, clinical research center. SUBJECTS: In all, 42 healthy, severely obese Caucasian and African-American (AA) adults (93% female, 64% Caucasian, age=37.8±1.2y, weight=123±4.2 kg, BMI=44.5±1 kg/m²), recruited through physician referral and newspaper ads, participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Indices of β-cell activity, insulin and GLP-1 response before and during a 75-gm oral glucose tolerance test were determined before and after 24 weeks of octreotide-LAR. RESULTS: AA exhibited higher β-cell activity, and insulin and GLP-1 concentrations than Caucasians. Octreotide-LAR suppressed the insulin and GLP-1 levels in both groups.

These groups have to work in the face of conflicting goals. The dedicated whites are for a biracial residential community. Many Negroes share this goal, yet the shortage of housing for middle class Negroes is great enough to interest them and others in self-segregation and they push toward housing for Negroes even if it results in an all-Negro community.

Abstract = {Over the past four decades, immigration has increased the racial and ethnic diversity in the United States. Once a mainly biracial society with a large white majority and relatively small black minority--and an impenetrable color line dividing these groups--the United States is now a society composed of multiple racial and ethnic groups. Along with increased immigration are rises in the rates of racial/ethnic intermarriage, which in turn have led to a sizeable and growing multiracial population. Currently, 1 in 40 persons identifies himself or herself as multiracial, and this figure could soar to 1 in 5 by the year 2050. Increased racial and ethnic diversity brought about by the new immigration, rising intermarriage, and patterns of multiracial identification may be moving the nation far beyond the traditional and relatively persistent black/white color line. In this chapter, we review the extant theories and recent findings concerning immigration, intermarriage, and multiracial identification, and consider the implications for America's changing color lines. In particular, we assess whether racial boundaries are fading for all groups or whether America's newcomers are simply crossing over the color line rather than helping to eradicate it.

Abstract = {Objective: To test whether level of depressive symptoms predicted the rate of cognitive decline in a biracial community of older persons. Methods: 4,392 older people (88% of those eligible) from a defined community in Chicago completed 2 or 3 structured interviews at approximately 3-year intervals for an average of 5.3 years. At the baseline interview, the number of depressive symptoms was assessed with a 10 item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Cognitive function was assessed at each interview with 4 performance tests, from which a previously established measure of global cognition was derived. Random effects models were used to assess change in cognition and its relation to depressive symptoms, controlling for age, sex, race, education, and baseline cognitive function. Results: Participants reported a median of one depressive symptom at baseline. For each depressive symptom, the rate of cognitive decline increased by a mean of about 5%. Results were not substantially changed when persons with cognitive impairment at baseline were excluded, or when chronic illness or participation in cognitively stimulating activities was controlled, and the association was not modified by age, sex, race, or education. Conclusions: The results suggest that depressive symptoms predict cognitive decline in old age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to provide prevalence estimates of Alzheimer disease (AD) for the US population from 2000 through 2050. AD incidence estimates from a population-based, biracial, urban study, using a stratified random sampling design, were converted to prevalence estimates and applied to US Census Bureau estimates of US population growth. A geographically defined community of 3 adjacent neighborhoods in Chicago applied to the US population. Alzheimer disease incidence was measured in 3838 persons free of AD at baseline; 835 persons were evaluated for disease incidence. Main Outcome Measure: Current and future estimates of prevalence of clinically diagnosed AD in the US population. In 2000, there were 4.5 million persons with AD in the US population. By 2050, this number will increase by almost 3-fold, to 13.2 million. Owing to the rapid growth of the oldest age groups of the US population, the number who are 85 years and older will more than quadruple to 8.0 million. The number who are 75 to 84 years old will double to 4.8 million, while the number who are 65 to 74 years old will remain fairly constant at 0.3 to 0.5 million. The number of persons with AD in the US population will continue to increase unless new discoveries facilitate prevention of the disease.

Abstract = {The concept of multiraciality prides itself on the trouble it supposedly causes to the White supremacist rage for order, that is, its ostensible violation of racial discipline and its alleged threat to spurious notions of racial purity. The attention now refocused by the question of race mixture in the present conjuncture around both the pressing matter of racial oppression in America and the tenuous and ambivalent processes of racialisation, provides another opportunity for thinking critically about the production of racialised difference itself. In the wake of the 'biracial baby boom' we are forced to engage, yet again, with the domain of sexuality as a crucial field for the historical invention of race. The emergence of a popular multiracial consciousness in the post-civil rights era in the US contains some critical promise not only for the politics of racial identity per se, but also for sustained reflection on the vicissitudes of desire. We must carefully consider precisely against what multiracial identity asserts its actualisation and its empowerment in its purportedly affirmative moment. Anything less than such a critical double duty can only result in the formation of as yet another 'identical' and hegemonic structure' within the regime of White supremacy.

Abstract = {Estimates of around 1.7-2.4% of the population in the USA, 2% in Canada, and 0.6% in Britain now self-identify as mixed race. Inter-ethnic unions comprise around 2.7% of all unions in the USA and 1.3% in Britain and are increasing. The impact of these changes on the ethnic/racial diversity of Britain and North America and the demand from persons of mixed race to describe their 'full' identity requires a response from government and Census agencies that classify the population by race/ethnicity. Research show that the self-understandings of persons of mixed race may incorporate a range of identities, some biracial and others a single group like 'black', although the options available in the USA may still be limited by the legacy of the hypodescent policy. The solutions offered by classifications in the 2000/2001 round of censuses include a subdivided 'mixed' category in England and Wales and provision to select one or more categories in the USA. This marks an end to the official conceptualisation of 'pure' races that has been so pervasive in the past and, for the first time, offers mixed race identity to those of mixed heritage.

Abstract = {The influence of sexual orientation was examined on sexual risk behaviors, disclosure patterns, substance use, and stressful live events among 231 gay and bisexual youth (aged 14-23 yrs) living with HIV. Youth were mainly of ethnic minority heritage: 69.3% were Hispanic, African American, or biracial. Although there were significant differences in gay and bisexual youth's self-label and patterns of sexual attraction and sexual partners, there were few differences in other behavioral risk acts. The frequency of sexual risk acts, substance use, stressful life events, and child sexual abuse were similar for gay and bisexual youth and similar across ethnic groups. Disclosure of sexual orientation was significantly more common among gay youth compared with bisexual youth. Gay and bisexual identification appears to be a more critical factor than ethnicity in placing youth at risk for HIV. Care providers need to screen youth for sexual orientation and behaviors at a young age and inquire about age of partners, substance use, and history of sexual abuse.

Abstract = {Individuals confronted with poverty are at increased risk for disease and death due, in part, to the influence of macro social structures on differential exposure and heightened responsiveness to stress (Williams, 1990). For this reason, the influence of personality hardiness in moderating the stress-illness relationship in a biracial sample (African- American and European-American) of low-income women was examined. The effect of differential perceptions of the community on illness also was studied. Participants (100) completed rating scales, including Social Readjustment, Dispositional Resilience, Community Stress, and Seriousness of Illness. Hierarchical regression indicated that hardiness moderated the stress-illness relationship (p < .01), with high stress, low hardy women having higher levels of illness. In addition, race moderated the effect of stress, with high stress, Caucasian women having higher levels of illness. Group mean differences on community stress scores for low and high hardy women were obtained (p < .0001), but community stress was not associated with illness. Stress is linked to illness in low-income women; furthermore, both personality hardiness and being African-American buffer the effect of stress.

Abstract = {Culture and Counseling: New Approaches reflects the writings of a group of leading scholars on the topic and includes up-to-date discussions of their theories, research, counseling approaches, and cultural viewpoints. The numerous chapters cover national and international cultural perspectives and encompass a variety of counseling concerns and clientele groups. The book's position is that the United States is not an insulated, multicultural capsule that is isolated from and unaffected by the rest of the world. Therefore, it is necessary to present a book, such as this one, that addresses the cultural dynamics within the United States as well as ways in which U.S. culture interfaces with world cultures in this exciting and challenging era of one interdependent and interactive global community. The book does this by including a section that presents chapters on international and intercultural dimensions of counseling. The text is divided into six parts with a total of twenty-four chapters. Part One, Cultural Viewpoints of Counseling, has four chapters. Part Two, Ethnicity and Counseling, includes five chapters on the major ethnic groups in the United States. Part Three, International and Intercultural Dimensions, includes three chapters related to international counseling or global implications for counseling. Part Four, Innovative Cross-Cultural Models and Theories, contains three chapters of theoretical models of cross-cultural or multicultural counseling. Part Five focuses on intervention and prevention strategies and commences with nine culture-centered counseling cases that overlap cultural dynamics with counseling themes or concerns, such as racial identity, sexual identity, drug abuse, AIDS and holistic healing, family conflict, biracial youth problems, and a posttraumatic experience. Part Six, Special Topics, Issues, and Trends in Culture and Counseling, has five chapters, including the wrap-up or concluding chapter. Also within the various chapters of this book are discussion questions, counseling cases, vignettes, and examples to stimulate creative thoughts in the classroom and in the counseling work setting.

A total of 1,118 volunteers from a biracial cohort participated in the study (mean age 74 yrs). Volunteers were recruited using a stratified, cluster sampling technique. In a standard order, several questionnaires were administered, soliciting information on socioeconomic status, physical health, social support, and emotional experience. The physical health questionnaire included questions on whether or not the volunteer experienced sleep disorder, visual impairment, heart disease, respiratory disease, arthritis, and hypertension. Data on the prevalence of reported sleep problems and visual impairment among older adults are reported. Results indicate that of the total sample, 9% used sleep medicine, 25% reported difficulty falling asleep, 52% indicated experiencing difficulty maintaining sleep, 28% reported waking up early in the morning, and 12% reported daytime sleep longer than 2 hours. Chi-square results showed greater sleep complaints for volunteers with visual impairment. ANOVA revealed that visually impaired volunteers had a higher index rate of sleep disturbance.

During the 1st wave of the survey, 4,162 65+ yr olds participated in an interview at their homes. During this interview, data were collected to assess demographics, functional status, cognitive status, depression and self-report of diabetes. In addition, subjects were asked to estimate their height and weight for the interviewers, from which data body mass index (BMI) was estimated. In both uncontrolled and controlled analyses, female gender, lower education, functional impairment and cognitive impairment were associated with comorbid depression/diabetes and depression/high BMI. Age was not associated with comorbid depression/diabetes but younger age was associated with depression/cognitive impairment. African American race was strongly associated with depression/diabetes but not with depression/high BMI. More studies of comorbidity in the general population should be implemented to determine the relationship between these comorbid conditions and risk factors.

BE prevalence was highest among African American boys relative to the other demographic groups: 26% in African American boys, 17% in African American girls, 19% in White boys, and 18% in White girls. BE rates increased with age for White Ss and decreased with age for African American Ss. Depressive symptoms and consumption of high-fat foods predicted BE status, whereas SES, BMI, eating attitudes, body image discrepancy, dieting, and low activity level failed to add predictive value. The observation of developmental differences in binging between Whites and African Americans corresponds to their physical maturational divergence. These findings underscore the need for population-based surveys that sample binge eating across age, gender, and ethnicity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In 1986, a stratified random household sample of 4,162 community residents 65 years of age and older formed the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Of those available 6 years later, 78.4% (n=1,999) were genotyped, providing 'baseline' data at this time. The available survivors (n=1,529) provided longitudinal data 4 years later. Using longitudinal data from this sample, a combination of measures assessing self-care capability, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and mobility was obtained at baseline and 4 years later (n=1,529) to determine the extent to which the E4 allele affected change in functional status. Functional status was assessed using items from a modified Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale, the Older American Resources and Services IADL scale, and the Rosow-Breslau physical health scale. APOE E4 was not associated with decline in functional status in either bivariate or multivariate analyses as a main effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Explored whether a racial/ethnic group cross-over effect is emerging in the use and sales of methamphetamine (MTH) or "crank," particularly by African American American gang members. Data on 1,042 juvenile and adult offenders who were self-reported gang members were collected as part of Project GANGMILL from the National Gang Crime Research Center. The research also examined use and sales of crack cocaine (CC). Survey results are summarized for: regional variations in MTH use, gender differences, racial differences (African American, Hispanic/Latino, White, Asian/Chinese, Native American Indian, biracial), and gang alliance factors. The results show a cross-over effect for methamphetamine use and sales, but indicate that some preference patterns continued when race or ethnic background was controlled. While the results show that African-American gang members were less likely to use MTH than other racial categories, such gang members were not more likely to prefer CC instead or to be involved in CC sales. The strongest evidence of a cross-over effect emerged in the evidence for ample competition across ethnic groups for sales of MTH through their gang organization.

Abstract = {The impact of racial context on white voters' support for Black candidates in biracial elections has drawn considerable attention from students of racial politics. Two major theories-Black threat and social interaction-use different geographic units and provide conflicting explanations. The present study seeks to contribute to the resolution of the controversy by empirically examining White crossover voting at both election unit and neighborhood levels. Twenty-nine mayoral and councilmanic district elections in New Orleans from 1977 to 1998 are investigated. The findings are not consistent with the hypotheses derived from black threat and social interaction theories. Rather than a reflection of racial tolerance or hostility, the changes in White crossover voting in different racial contexts may indicate a rational and strategic adjustment on the part of White voters when they face the prospect of Black electoral success.

Abstract = {Examined whether parent social influences are associated with health-risk behaviors more than peer social influences among young minority adolescents. 176 Hispanic, Black, and biracial 7th grade students (aged 12–14+ yrs) completed questionnaires concerning tobacco use, alcohol use, onset of sexual activity, and marijuana use. Ss also reported information concerning the 5 social influences of (1) parental disapproval of health-risk behaviors; (2) parent modeling of health-risk behaviors; (3) parent monitoring of health-risks; (4) peer disapproval of health risks; and (5) peer modeling of health-risk behaviors. Results show that 20% of Ss reported using tobacco, the majority used alcohol in the past year, 13.3% were sexually active, and 12% reported marijuana use. Parental influences were associated with differences in alcohol use, whereas peer influences were associated with differences in all other examined variables. Peer social influences were the only measures independently associated with abstinence from tobacco. In all examined areas, peers emerged as the most consistent social influence on health-risk behavior. It is concluded that peers and peer group behavior may be better predictors of adolescent health risk behaviors than parental social influences among young adolescents.

Abstract = {Examined the stress–illness relationship in a biracial group (African-American and Caucasian-American) of low-income women. Two personality constructs, hardiness and John Henryism, were studied for their possible moderating influences on the stress-illness relationship. 100 women (aged 18–55 yrs) with family incomes below the poverty line, completed questionnaires of stress, illness, hardiness, and John Henryism. Hierarchical regression models indicated that hardiness moderated the stress-illness relationship, with high stress, low hardy women having higher levels of illness. In addition, race also moderated the effect of stress, with high stress, Caucasian women having higher levels of illness. Analyses of additional stress measures indicated that hardy women perceive their external environments as less stressful, although high and low hardy women have similar levels of network stress. Correlational analyses indicated that life-event stress, network stress and low-income concerns were all associated with illness scores. Thus, a range of stress measures are linked to physical illness in low-income women; furthermore, hardiness and being African-American both buffered the effects of stress on illness.

Abstract = {Performed serial neuropsychological assessments to detect vascular risk factors for cognitive decline in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort, a large biracial, multisite, longitudinal investigation of initially middle-aged individuals. Cognitive assessments were administered to 8,729 white and 2,234 black Ss on 2 occasions separated by 6 yrs. Ss were aged 47–70 yrs at the 1st assessment. The cognitive assessments included the delayed word recall test, a 10-word delayed free recall task in which the learning phase included sentence generation with the study words, the digit symbol subtest (DSS) of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised (WAIS--R), and the first-letter word fluency (WF) test. In multivariate analyses (controlling for demographic factors), the presence of diabetes at baseline was associated with greater decline in scores on both the DSS and WF test, and the presence of hypertension at baseline was associated with greater decline on the DSS alone. The association of diabetes with cognitive decline persisted when analysis was restricted to the 47–57-yr-old subgroup. Smoking status, carotid intima–media wall thickness, and hyperlipidemia at baseline were not associated with change in cognitive test scores.

Blood pressure (BP) variation in response to the demands of daily life was assessed by 24-hr ambulatory monitoring on a typical workday. Ss were classified into groups by stable pessimistic attributions (high vs low pessimism) and by SES (high vs low). Significant SES × pessimism interactions were found. Low SES/high pessimism women demonstrated higher systolic BP (SBP) during the day, evening, and sleep periods of 24-hr ambulatory monitoring compared with the other three groups. A greater proportion of this group was in the hypertensive range compared with the other groups. Low SES/high pessimism women also reported reduced available social support compared with the other three groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The authors analyzed prospective data from a community-based, biracial cohort of 4,000 black and white older adults (aged 65–105 yrs) followed for 10 years to determine sociodemographic and health characteristics associated with the use of these medications between 1986–1996. A total of 13.3% of the Ss were taking these medications in 1986, with the frequency of use declining only to 11.8% in 1996 despite the cohort aging 10 years. Correlates of use at baseline were female gender, white race, depressive symptoms, poor self-rated health, impaired physical function, and health services use. These correlates persisted for each of the three follow-up waves of the survey. Despite the overall decline in the use of sedative, hypnotics, and antianxiety agents in the general population in recent years, over the 10 years of this survey, an aging cohort continued to use these medications at a frequency greater than the general population and did not demonstrate a significant decline in use. Factors unrelated to health status, specifically being white, were among the strongest correlates of use throughout the years of follow-up.

Abstract = {Differences in motives for condom use and their implications for understanding frequency of use were investigated in a random, biracial (Black, White) sample of heterosexuals, aged 17 to 25 years (n = 902). Results indicated that sexually active young adults—regardless of race, age, gender, or relationship status—were more likely to use condoms to prevent pregnancy than to prevent disease. Reasons for use mediated the effects of relationship status on condom use per se and moderated the effects of attitudinal and perceptual variables on condom use. Finally, comparisons among condom users motivated by different prevention goals and nonusers (n = 388) revealed that differences among user subgroups were nearly as numerous and, in some cases, more robust than differences between users and nonusers. These findings indicate that condom users comprise distinct subgroups, defined in part by their underlying motives for use, and highlight important conceptual and empirical reasons to distinguish among them.

Overall more frequent participation in cognitive activities was associated with younger age, more education, higher family income, female gender, and White race, participation in activities judged to be more cognitively intense was not strongly related to age, but was associated with more education, higher family income, male gender, and White race. Substantial heterogeneity in activity patterns remained after accounting for demographic factors, however. In an analysis controlling for demographic variables, level of cognitive function on performance tests was positively related to composite measures of the frequency and intensity of cognitive activity. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess the relation of cognitive activity patterns to stability and change in cognitive function in older persons.

Abstract = {Society's definition of "family" is rapidly expanding and has come to include single parents, biracial couples, blended families, unrelated individuals living cooperatively, and homosexual couples, among others. Unfortunately, family policy has been slow to catch up to changing trends in modern lifestyles. Specifically, adoption policy has yet to sanction joint adoption by same-sex couples. As a result, these couples are forced to manipulate the words of the law and "go in the back door" to be able to parent the children they have so longed for and who desperately need families. This article uses a practice example to examine current policy, cite the need for change, and explore some of the myths and misperceptions that cloud the judgments made by policymakers, court officials, and child welfare professionals, thereby keeping waiting children without families and waiting parents without children.

A computer-assisted telephone survey of a biracial sample of 311 parents of 8–17 yr old children provided more generalizable information regarding parental beliefs and behaviors. Results show that nearly 50% of the households either allowed teen smoking, had no ground rules, or had set restrictive rules but never communicated them to the children. Compared to White parents, African-American parents felt more empowered to affect their children's behaviors and were more likely to actively participate in anti-tobacco socialization within the home. Among the African-American parents, 98% reported 18 yrs or older to be an appropriate age for teens to make up their own minds about using tobacco, whereas 26% of White parents though 16 yrs to be an appropriate age. Parents who smoked reported more frequent rule-making than those who did not smoke, but were more likely to believe that childhood tobacco use is inevitable.

This study used 4 female graduate students (2 Black and 2 White) and 4 male graduate students (2 Black and 2 White) to interview and request secrets from 128 children aged 6–11 yrs who varied in race (51 Black, 43 Caucasian, and 34 Biracial, Hispanic or Asian children). Results show that race of the interviewer requesting the secret strongly affected disclosure, with Black children particularly showing an unwillingness to disclose a negative secret to a different race interviewer. Children at high risk for sexual abuse (as assessed by the D. Finkelhor checklist) also were more likely to keep the secret. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Describes the HIV prevention program at the Gender Identity Project (GIP) of New York City's Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center. The authors look at the program participants from 1990 to the present. The data shows that 55% of GIP clients are White, 20% Latino/a, 14% African American and 10% are biracial or multiracial. The mean age for white clients is 36 yrs, for African Americans 32 and for Latino/a 28. The GIP's roots in peer education and community building make it an ideal vehicle for HIV education. The needs assessment and prevention strategies that are used by GIP are also discussed. One of the many effective prevention strategies is a 40-min video funded by the New York State AIDS Institute that focuses on HIV prevention in the context of community building. The making of the video became a community-based education event. The video is used as both an education and training tool and over 150 copies have been distributed around the world.

Structured survey interviews were conducted in the foster homes of 302 randomly selected 6–12 yr olds, who were living in foster care for 6 mo or more and placed from 3 county service areas. Follow-up mental health assessments using the existing system of care format were completed in 255 children. 16% of these children in foster care were found to have taken psychotropic medication during their lifetime. The most common class of medication used in the past year was stimulants (62%). Children who were older, from Caucasian and biracial backgrounds, and who lived in a group home were more likely to have taken psychotropic medication in the past year. Among children who received a clinician diagnosis of a severe psychiatric disorder for which medication is an accepted component of care, boys were more likely to received medication treatment than girls. Sociodemographic characteristics and placement history variables may be influential in the level of psychotropic medication use among this population.

Abstract = {The topic of overrepresentation commands attention in the literature on "judgmental categories" of disability (e.g., learning disabilities), yet the evidence reported to date bearing on the issue are less than precise. This article distinguishes between the percentage of category or program by group and percentage of group in category or program. The authors caution drawing causal inferences from what are descriptive data relating "race/ethnicity" to "placement in disability category." Caution is in order because the data represent aggregated data on race/ethnicity from sources that use different approaches to recording a child's race, fail to account for biracial children, and fail to consider the possibility that social class rather than race/ethnicity may be implicated. The 2nd variable considered is placement in state-sanctioned disability categories. The variability in rates across states reported in Annual Reports to Congress, coupled with research data demonstrating the lack of decision reliability, raises serious doubts concerning the validity of these designations. Cross-tabulating 2 categorical variables so fraught with measurement problems compromises any conclusions that might be drawn. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Retrospective reports of contraceptive use on 2 occasions of intercourse (separated by 2 years on average) were used to examine change in contraceptive practice as a function of intervening pregnancy experience in a randomly selected biracial (Black and White) sample of 466 female adolescents (aged 13–19 yrs). Although all Ss, regardless of pregnancy experience, improved their contraceptive use, Ss experiencing an unplanned pregnancy or pregnancy scare appeared to improve relatively more. However, differences between groups could be explained by the differential passage of time, and this was true among both Black and White Ss. Specifically, ever-pregnant Ss had been sexually active the longest and showed the most improvement; never-pregnant Ss who had never had a pregnancy scare had been sexually active the shortest period and showed the least improvement, while Ss experiencing a pregnancy scare were intermediate on both variables. These findings suggest that prior research may have drawn faulty conclusions about the effects of pregnancy experience on subsequent contraceptive behavior, and that future research on these topics may need to pay greater attention to the passage of time as an important substantive and methodological factor in its own right.

Abstract = {Investigated the role that nonracial and racial factors play in spouse selection among those who are married Black/White. This research endeavor attempted to determine if nonracial factors characterized by socioeconomic and commonality variables are more important in the mate selection process in comparison with those related to racial differences. Race, gender, age, and educational achievement of the biracially married individual were introduced as independent variables along with premarital biracial dating history to determine if they mitigate the influence of marital selection factors. A national sample of biracially married individuals was identified through a research advertisement placed in 12 consecutive issues of the Interrace magazine. 371 participants from 38 states within the US completed a mail-out questionnaire and 292 26–54 yr old respondents were included for analysis. The results reveal that nonracial factors are more important than racial factors for spouse selection among Ss. Many Ss stated that common interests and attractiveness of the person, irrespective of racial group membership, were very important factors.

Personal advertisements were used in an attempt to examine such relationships at their initial contact. 195 female-seeking-male advertisements and 234 male-seeking-female advertisements were used (133 Whites and 296 Blacks). No unexpected relationships were revealed. Males were significantly positively correlated to Whites. There was almost an equal number of Black males and Black females, but significantly more White males than White females. This difference may represent a greater willingness of White males to date biracially. Alternately, it is also possible that there is a cultural difference between Whites and Blacks so that White females are less likely to advertise than Black females.

Selected sedentary activities (TV watching and video-computer-game playing) were also assessed. Overall, boys were more physically active than girls and engaged in more heavy physical activity, while girls reported a larger percentage of time spent in light and moderate physical activities. Gender and, to a lesser extent, ethnic differences were seen in the types of activities reported. Although most physical activity occurred after school, children who reported no physical education class during school had less physical activity overall. There was a decrease in moderate physical activity with increasing grade levels in school and an increase in sedentary behavior. Black children reported more sedentary activity than White children, and girls reported more than boys. Although this 24-hr method has limitations, it allows characterization of the activity of groups of children and provides useful data for policy recommendations.

No racial differences were found in prevalence of dementia-spectrum diagnoses. Depression was typically diagnosed more than twice as often in White Ss, whereas Black Ss showed higher chronic medical illness burden. These results suggest that cognitive, medical, and psychiatric disabilities may prove important as determinants of racial differences in movement into long-term care and differences in treatment needs of nursing home residents.

Abstract = {Examined changes in 5 indicators of blood cholesterol awareness in 2 comparable biracial communities in South Carolina. One community received 3 yrs of cholesterol education and intervention activities, and the other served as a comparison. Cross-sectional, interviewer-administered and random digit-dialed telephone surveys of 11,070 adults were conducted from 1987 to 1991. Significant increases in knowledge, behavior and risk awareness were observed for most groups defined by race, sex, or age in both communities. Significant net intervention increases between 1987 and 1991 were seen for knowledge of good cholesterol level, behavioral action of having blood cholesterol checked and knowledge of personal level of blood cholesterol. It is concluded that a community-wide blood cholesterol screening and education program can serve as part of a public health strategy to lower and treat high blood cholesterol levels in a community.

Among hypertensive Blacks, overweight persons were substantially more likely than non-overweight persons to be aware of their hypertension.

Many, if not most, subjects are explored from the dual perspective of minority group members and of members of the dominant culture. The result is a spectrum with particular but not exclusive relevance for those who work with women in the area of mental health and for readers who seek to enrich their lives with psychological insights and understanding of antiracism.  Readers will find help in these pages for questions concerning racial and cultural differences. It is not merely a quick-fix book but rather a set of . . . essays that can help well-meaning individuals turn good intentions into good behaviors.  Racism in the Lives of Women . . . covers these topics and others: connections between racisim and violence against women; White women's efforts to be antiracist; difficulty and necessity of maintaining an antiracist perspective; biracial and bicultural identity formation [and] developing an antiracist norm as part of feminist ethics.

Ss were 101 males and 28 females, consisting of 30 Whites, 93 Blacks, 3 Hispanics, and 4 biracial individuals, aged 12–17 yrs. Results suggest that juveniles tend to act in concert with others in delinquent acts. White females tended to act in concert with others more than Black females in the commission of delinquent acts. However, no significant effects were found for social facilitation and severity of crime. Study 2 addressed the same question and whether the crime happened in the presence or absence of others from 30 records from a juvenile delinquency home. The best predictor of severity of crime was the number of people involved with the crime. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

She had also presented a variety of behavioral difficulties and initially was treated with sertraline and citalopram with poor response.

She was hospitalized overnight and then treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride.

To date, few psychological measures have been created specifically to investigate the experiences of multiracial people. This article describes 2 studies focused on the development and psychometric properties of the Multiracial Challenges and Resilience Scale (MCRS). The MCRS was developed using a nationwide Internet sample of urban, multiracial adults. Exploratory factor analyses revealed 4 Challenge factors (Others' Surprise and Disbelief Regarding Racial Heritage, Lack of Family Acceptance, Multiracial Discrimination, and Challenges With Racial Identity) and 2 Resilience factors (Appreciation of Human Differences and Multiracial Pride). A confirmatory factor analysis with data from a second sample provided support for the stability of this factor structure. The reliability and validity of the measure, implications of these findings, and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Originally published in Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books, 1993, Vol 38(3), 306-307. Reviews the book, Racially Mixed People in America by Maria P. P. Root (Ed.) (see record [rid]1992-97305-000[/rid]). In this edited volume, Root presents a new paradigm for the emerging multiracial population in America. The call for deconstruction of existing theory and the creation of new paradigms for understanding and investigating the multicultural experience is a major premise of this book. Existing social, political, and theoretical frameworks--based on monocultural, monoracial, linear models of social relations and social identity--have forced biracial individuals to choose one or the other culture and to deny significant parts of their heritage and existence.

Reviews the book, Children of Color: Psychological Interventions with Minority Youth by Jewelle Taylor Gibbs and Larke Nahme Huang (Eds.) (see record [rid]1989-97725-000[/rid]). This book is a well-documented synthesis of demographic data, sociocultural influences, recommended treatment strategies, and expository vignettes. Each chapter contains an overview of commonly held social perceptions of a major ethnic minority group in America (i e , African, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Native, and Puerto Rican) and two growing groups of youth, Southeast Asian refugees and biracial adolescents. In sum, this book is a concise, well-organized, well-documented presentation of the research regarding the effects of sociocultural factors and of how these must be considered when assessing and treating children and youth of ethnic minority groups. It provides the reader with useful minority and majority group contrasts as well as within-minority-group differences. This information will benefit the experienced practitioner, the novice, and the practitioner-in-training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Brett M. Kissela et al. (see record [rid]2012-33957-008[/rid]). Kissela et al. report their findings on 12-year trends in young stroke incidence in the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study (GCNKSS). The finding of increased stroke incidence in this racially diverse population raises several questions. Is the increased incidence among young adults an artifact of changes in diagnostic testing, particularly MRI? The progressive adoption of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic tool during the study period challenges the validity of comparison of acute stroke diagnoses between these epochs. MRI is substantially more sensitive for the diagnosis of minor and self-resolving clinical ischemic stroke than CT. The investigators attempted to account for the evolution in diagnostic practices by maintaining the diagnostic criteria— ICD-9 coding and the medical record—for ascertainment of stroke across time intervals. The use of MRI among cases with a diagnosis of stroke increased dramatically across time periods, from 18% of patients in 1993–1994 to 58% in 2005. MRI findings are likely to influence recorded ICD-9 diagnosis, since clinicians will identify patients with MRI abnormalities as having had a stroke. If the sensitivity of CT for a minor stroke is 40%, and 80% had only CT in 1993–1994, 50% of minor strokes would have been missed, compared with only 25% in 2005.

Abstract = {This latest edition (see record [rid]2002-06787-000[/rid]) offers a contemporary expansion of the definition of multicultural counseling that pushes the boundaries of the field and allows for a more inclusive and meaningful way of looking at and treating diverse populations. The authors have updated the book to include new developments in research, theory, and practice. Major additions include: a more expansive definition of multiculturalism; the most recent statistics on the changing complexion of society; and implications for counseling and clinical practice that these changes have precipitated, which are forcing clinicians to redefine their roles and reeducate themselves on how to tend to these varied populations. The book includes new chapters on counseling biracial/multiracial populations, women, gays/lesbians, the physically challenged, the elderly, and monocultural organizations; a new section in every chapter covering implications for clinical practice; updated chapters on counseling African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. The reviewer concludes that the book combines a sound conceptual framework for multicultural counseling with proven therapeutic methods for specific populations.

Abstract = {Binge eating is associated with a host of adverse outcomes, but little is known about sex and racial differences among those who binge eat. The present study examined sex and racial group differences in binge eating based on weight status within a college-student population. It was hypothesized that White women would endorse higher rates of binge eating, depression, anxiety, and body image dissatisfaction than other groups. Participants completed a web-based survey assessing depression, anxiety, body image, weight history, physical activity, smoking, and body mass index. Participants included White, Black, and Bi/Multiracial college students. Findings highlighted sex and racial differences based on binge eating and weight status. Notably, Bi/Multiracial women who endorsed binge eating behavior and who were overweight reported greater levels of anxiety than all other groups and greater levels of depression than White women and White men. Additionally, Bi/Multiracial women and White women who endorsed binge eating behavior and who were overweight reported greater body image dissatisfaction relative to Black women and White men. Future research should further explore the nature and impact of sex and race differences on binge eating. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Investigated the effects of sex and race on dominance behavior as a function of a challenger's sex and race. Dominance was defined as the number of verbal challenges against an S's picture choice that an S withstood. Each of 128 undergraduate Ss and a confederate recorded individual preferences and joint decisions for the more attractive picture of 20 pairs of pictures. The number of challenges an S sustained each time a disagreement occurred regarding the more attractive picture of a pair was recorded. Results support the theory of status characteristics when Ss participated with White confederates: Black females were more dominant than White females and Black males, and White males were more dominant than Black males. With a Black confederate, however, Black males became significantly more dominant, whereas the behavior of the other 3 groups did not change. All Ss withstood significantly fewer challenges from females than from males. Results suggest that the characteristics of group members as well as the characteristics of a single person must be examined to obtain an accurate picture of mixed-sex or biracial interactions.

Through the oral and anal stages, conflict has grown in their relationship due to the mother's way of viewing her child as well as her own unresolved adolescent separation difficulties. The 2nd case is an overprotective mother whose own pathology prevented her daughter from resolving her rapprochement crisis.

Abstract = {Provides descriptive data on the Type A (coronary prone) behavior pattern from an urban, biracial sample of 8–10 yr old children. Type A behavior was assessed using K. A. Matthews and J. M. Siegel's (1982) youth test for health (MYTH). High MYTH scores were more prevalent in males relative to females and in Black males relative to White males. Parent self-reports suggested that Type A Ss were more outgoing, talkative, and physically active than Type B Ss; they were more aggressive in their interactions with others and were more likely to experience a greater number of aversive significant life events than Type B Ss. No differences in resting heart rate or diastolic or systolic blood pressure were found between Type A and Type B Ss; there were no differences on measures of the family environment.

Abstract = {Examined racial E effects in counseling-like interviews employing the verbal operant-conditioning paradigm. The general objective was to determine whether significant differences in the conditionability of 12 Black and 12 White female college students, as measured by their emission of positive and negative self-reference emotional affect statements, would obtain when the verbal reinforcement was provided by 2 Black and 2 White Es. A postexperimental inquiry assessed Ss' perceptions of the interviews and their level of awareness of the Es' to influence their verbal behavior. While no definitive conclusions were reached, this study demonstrates that the verbal operant-conditioning paradigm can be used to investigate racial effects on verbal behavior in the counseling interview. Through the use of multiple, biracial Es and Ss, this study goes a step further than other verbal operant-conditioning studies that have explored racial E effects. The absence of significant differences in the E-S racial interaction suggests that race, per se, may not be the most important variable in the E-S (or counselor-client) relationship.

These categories include (1) overview/rationale (which emphasized history, definitions, and goals), (2) theoretical models, (3) instructional models and strategies, and (4) teaching guides. It is noted that different terms are often used synonymously for multicultural education, as reflected in the titles of the books. It is suggested that educators should be aware that books, authors, or programs that are billed as multicultural education may be advocating quite different things. It is difficult to tell, for example, how much social change, or how much cultural assimilation, a person who uses the term multicultural education is advocating. Recommendations are offered for advancing the field of multicultural education, and a typology of terms is provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the self-concepts of ability, general self-concepts, levels of externality, and the attitudes toward physical characteristics, neighborhoods, and schools of 98 8–18 yr old Black students. Most of the Ss had upper middle class and highly educated parents. Ss were administered the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale, a self-concept of ability scale, a racial attitude scale, and a 45-item questionnaire, developed by the investigator to measure, among other factors, attitudes toward both Whites and Blacks. Results show that the predominantly White suburban communities in which the Ss were socialized had not prevented them from developing positive attitudes toward themselves, their communities, and their schools. Ss were biracial in their attitudes—they had positive attitudes toward both Blacks and Whites—although they were slightly more positive toward Blacks than Whites. Findings suggest that Black children socialized within predominantly White suburban communities are likely to become highly attitudinally assimilated into White society and that this kind of assimilation may have complex effects on their racial attitudes toward Blacks and their levels of ethnocentrism. As attitudinal assimilation increased, Ss became increasingly more positive toward their schools and neighborhoods and more positive toward Whites, but less positive toward Blacks.

Abstract = {Contends that radical therapy problem-solving groups can bring communication and cooperative process skills to the political arena. The Mobilization Support Network in San Francisco provided a consultant who identified the needs of a multiracial community coalition to provide a foundation for unity, draw up an implementation plan, conduct a neighborhood campaign, evaluate regularly, and set up a workshop for strategies and goals under skilled leadership. The goal of radical therapy is to realize a contractual agreement with the facilitator of the group; the 2nd step is to acquire mobilization skills, including separating judgments from observations, identifying feelings and emotions, and stating desires clearly. A workshop using these skills lessened tensions in a biracial organization. A collective business experiencing verbal battles and general tension was helped when mediation resulted in agreements to equalize verbal skills, hold 2 weekly meetings, and to use communication and empathetic listening skills in the meetings and workplace.

Two ideal types of the educational change process observed for the "Becoming Place" during the period 1969–1975.

Abstract = {"Children of Color" fulfills several goals and will be useful in a wide variety of clinical, professional, and educational settings. First, its primary purpose is to present a well-balanced discussion of the issues involved in clinical assessment and treatment of minority children and adolescents from six major ethnic groups and two emerging special population groups. The various contributors cover a range of interventions, from psychodynamic to social cognitive to systems-oriented, with an ecological perspective providing a common thread across groups and serving to integrate the conventional with the more culturally based methods of intervention.  Second, a comparative, cross-cultural approach informs each chapter, enabling the reader to compare selected topics (for example, socialization practices, identity formation, coping strategies, assessment issues, treatment approaches) across ethnic groups.  Third, the book reflects a major commitment to an ecological perspective that recognizes the significant impact of social and environmental factors, such as poverty, discrimination, immigration, and family structure, on the adaptation and coping patterns of minority children and adolescents.  Regrettably, this book could not include every ethnic minority group. We have decided to focus on children and adolescents from six of the larger groups in the United States—Black Americans, Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, American Indians, Mexican Americans, and mainland Puerto Ricans—and two emerging groups, Southeast Asian refugees and biracial youth.

Abstract = {Following the foreword by Richard Cushing, Robert W. Gleason outlines Catholic theology which repudiates enforced segregation because mankind was created by "God who is One"; therefore the human races is one. Arthur A. North summarizes the decisions of the Supreme Court from Plessy to Brown; John W. Donohue, the development and philosophy of biracial schools; Robert F. Drinan, the problems of segregation in the North and the opportunity of Catholics to exert more effective leadership in eliminating segregation; Joseph H. Fichter, the inadequacy of generalizations, such as the necessity for gradualism and the futility of legislation for affecting morals; Anne Anastasi, the psychological research showing that attitudes can be modified, the adverse effect of segregation on personality, the role of culture on intelligence test scores; and in the final chapter, John La Farge concludes that the presence of Negroes is a precious gift of the Creator.

Abstract = {Where one lives is closely linked to social status. When that status is threatened the individual and the neighborhood take measures to combat this threat, usually by fleeing, but sometimes by violence. In the case of Negroes, the high visibility factor combined with the low status of Negroes as a group has produced an invasion-succession cycle that is separating most large American cities into 2 ghettos, Negro at core and white on the periphery. Our culture has developed in a direction where persons who view themselves as related to the dominant cultural norms cannot "afford" to live in a biracial neighborhood. 7 reasons are given as to why race and private housing is a particularly worthwhile research area today.

Abstract = {Certain fundamental aspects of interracial arrangements and behaviors in American society are contrasted with those of other white-governed societies. This contrast reveals the "uniqueness" of the American development, particularly in the operations of negro status. Also revealed are some fundamental differences. Thus, while America is working toward equality of the races, South Africa is still officially enforcing extreme segregation and Britain is denying, despite steady immigration, the existence of another race. Ever present is the singular basic factor in biracialism—the taboo in America (and South Africa) against intermarriage and the biracial family.

In response to Annabella Bushra's discussion and her focus on what is missing in the clinical material, the author speculates about the repetition of the historical trauma of purifying mixed race in the face of its complexity—trying to neatly package race despite it not so neatly fitting into any one category—and losing the individual by overly focusing on skin color. The author considers the silence, secrecy, and transgression in the treatment and, in this context, a few of Bushra's key points are addressed—sorting out the nature of hate in relation to Susan, passing as transgression, and White guilt. A distinction is made between a malevolent, destructive hate and a loving hate, and White guilt is considered as a defense against recognition of the other.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Christopher Bonovitz (see record [rid]2010-11288-008[/rid]). Christopher Bonovitz gives us a rich landscape of the theoretical, historical, and relational aspects of his work with his mixed-race patient. In my response I explore what seems missing: a stronger sense of the patient as a person, more of her own history in her family, more of the clinical back and forth with her therapist, a sense of what is being played out in the transference, and particularly what “passing” is for her. I show how his choices about how to think about her story and how to tell it are oversaturated with awareness of identity and race at the expense of the basic human relationship. In the face of such racial anxiety, there is a pull to rely too strongly on countertransference as a way to gain privileged access to knowledge about the other. I attribute many of these problems to the inescapable power of race in our culture. Furthermore, I address the themes of hatred, silence, secrecy and transgression as they relate to the history of transgenerational trauma for this patient and invite our broadening our awareness about how they play out in the therapeutic process. We are faced with the difficult, yet the essential task of holding and living out the patient's anger and outrage at the racial hatred that has been endured.

Abstract = {I was a few months into my final year of psychiatry training when I met Diane (not her real name), a woman in her late 20s who referred herself to our outpatient clinic. Aside from her age, I knew nothing about her as I prepared to greet her. Unlike most patients I see, she had no paper trail of prior visits to our clinic, nor any notes from other physicians in our hospital database. I had entered psychiatry with a biomedical slant, dubious toward and often embarrassed by those who were strident psychotherapy advocates. But I am certain that no medication could have altered Diane’s outlook on race the way that our sessions did. And for the first time, I witnessed the unique benefits that racial concordance can have in a clinic setting. I later learned that our pairing had actually been random, yet the outcome could not have been better if it had been arranged by those with the best intentions. In the end, it was a perfect match.

Abstract = {Dark skin shade and natural afro-hair are central in the politics of visibility, inclusion and exclusion within black anti-racist aesthetics. This article focuses on black beauty as performative through looking at how the discourse of dark skin equals black beauty is destabilized in the talk of 'mixed race' black women. A dark skin shade and natural afro hair become ambiguous signifiers as the women's talk leads to a mobility of black beauty. Their talk is thus an interception in which there can never be a definitive reading of black beauty while also pointing to the binaries of the black anti-racist aesthetics on which they draw. Thus, while women are rooted in racialized and racializing notions of beauty they expand the boundaries of the beautiful black woman's body. Black beauty as an undecidable resists binaries without ever constituting a third term and arises through the disidentification and shame of cultural melancholia.

Past psychological research has focused on the challenges multiracial individuals confront in defining a racial identity. The implication is that these challenges lead to outcomes that are psychologically detrimental. However, evidence to support this assertion is mixed. The authors review qualitative and quantitative empirical research examining multiracial individuals' identity development, depression, problem behaviors, peer relationships, school performance, and self-esteem, finding support for detrimental outcomes only in studies sampling clinical populations. Studies on nonclinical samples find that multiracial individuals tend to be just as well-adjusted as their monoracial peers on most psychological outcomes. Earlier assertions of maladjustment may have been due to reliance on qualitative research that sampled clinical populations. Other implications and future research are discussed.

Abstract = {(This reprinted article originally appeared in Journal of Child Psychology & Psychiatry & Allied Disciplines, 1995, Vol 36[8], 1399–1410. The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 83-22372.). Theories about "Black identity" are discussed in relation to a study of 58 adolescents (aged 14–18 yrs) with 1 White and 1 African or African-Caribbean parent. Interview findings on their racial self-definition, attitudes to their mixed parentage, and allegiance to Black and White people and cultures reveal a wide range of racial identities and cultural allegiances. Differences are related to type of school, social class, and the degree of politicization of the young person's attitudes to race. The findings are discussed in relation to the issue of interracial adoption and fostering, and to recent debates about the concept of an "essential" Black identity.

Abstract = {[The author] begins by describing how this country's racial purity laws have operated over the past 400 yrs. Then, in a series of autobiographical essays, she addresses how race and color interact in relationships between men and women, within families, and in the larger community. Scales-Trent ultimately explores the question of what we really mean by "race" in this country, once it is clear that race is not a tangible reality as reflected through color.  Scales-Trent uses autobiography both as a way to describe these issues and to develop a theory of the social construction of race. . . . Scales-Trent also celebrates the richness of her bicultural heritage and shows how she has revised her teaching methods to provide her law students with a multicultural education.

Abstract = {Assessed the extent to which 157 pregnant minority teenagers' (aged 11–19 yrs) support network members were the source of interpersonal problems, including criticism, intrusiveness, conflict, and disappointment. In addition to relating support, social strain, and life events, respectively, to depression levels, the interactions of these factors were examined. Ss, who were recruited from an alternative inner-city school for pregnant students, completed the SCL-90, Social Support Network Questionnaire, and Life Events Survey. Life events and social strain were positively related to depression. In addition, a significant interaction between social strain and cognitive guidance was found. Findings suggest that cognitive guidance may intervene between the experience of problematic social exchanges and the onset of depression.

The S had internalized White prejudices, living an identiy drama and caught in a paroxysm of narcissistic humiliation and despair. Nurturing a White ego idea, the S despised the Black traits in his body and hated his parents. The author notes that the S was, at the time of writing, studying to become a labor mediator so as to give a voice to the voiceless and powerless.

Abstract = {If the experience of integration is successful in reducing social distance between the Negro and white children, one would expect that race as a criterion (conscious or unconscious) for assessing friendship should exert less influence at the end of 2 weeks. The findings support this. Although at the end of camp the children still tend to prefer their white cabin mates as friends, there is a statistically significant drop in the extent to which they are the favored group. Indeed, at the end of camp, white and Negro campers were about equally desired as friends by the white children. One of the more significant effects of the equalitarian culture of the camp is the effect upon the Negro children's concept of their own race, and on their own personal self-esteem: oversensitivity to unfavorable behavior in Negro peers is decreased, other Negro children are described in more favorable terms than initially, and a lessened tendency to reject other Negro girls on friendship ratings.
