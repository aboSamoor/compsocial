Abstract = {This article describes the development and validation of the Multiracial Experiences Measure (MEM): a new measure that assesses uniquely racialized risks and resiliencies experienced by individuals of mixed racial heritage. Across 2 studies, there was evidence for the validation of the 25-item MEM with 5 subscales including Shifting Expressions, Perceived Racial Ambiguity, Creating Third Space, Multicultural Engagement, and Multiracial Discrimination. The 5-subscale structure of the MEM was supported by a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Evidence of criterion-related validity was partially supported with MEM subscales correlating with measures of racial diversity in one’s social network, color-blind racial attitude, psychological distress, and identity conflict. Evidence of discriminant validity was supported with MEM subscales not correlating with impression management. Implications for future research and suggestions for utilization of the MEM in clinical practice with multiracial adults are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Using a boundary perspective (Alba and Nee [Alba, Richard D., 2003]), I examine the marital behavior of three self‐identified multiracial groups: black/whites, American Indian/whites, Asian/whites. With a focus on marriage with whites, I assess whether the boundaries of whiteness are expanding to include these part‐white multiracial groups. Marrying whites at a large scale may signify that part‐white multiracial Americans are in the process of being accepted as “white.” At the same time, due to differences in the racial identity experiences of multiracial groups, marital patterns may differ by racial combination. Based on analysis of 2008–2012 American Community Survey data, I find that the majority of all three groups are married to whites, suggesting that most members in these groups are on the path to whiteness. On the other hand, multinomial logistic regression analysis demonstrates that American Indian/whites and Asian/whites are more likely than black/whites to have a white spouse, relative to spouses of another race/ethnicity. Moreover, separate regression analyses by multiracial group reveal gender differences in their likelihood of marrying whites for black/whites and Asian/whites. These results indicate racial stratification in the marriage market among part‐white multiracial Americans, with further stratification by gender for some groups.

Abstract = {Categorizations of multiracial individuals provide insight into the psychological mechanisms driving social stratification, but few studies have explored the interplay of cognitive and motivational underpinnings of these categorizations. In the present study, we integrated research on racial essentialism (i.e., the belief that race demarcates unobservable and immutable properties) and negativity bias (i.e., the tendency to weigh negative entities more heavily than positive entities) to explain why people might exhibit biases in the categorization of multiracial individuals. As theorized, racial essentialism, both dispositional (Study 1) and experimentally induced (Study 2), led to the categorization of Black-White multiracial individuals as Black, but only among individuals evaluating Black people more negatively than White people. These findings demonstrate how fundamental cognitive and motivational biases interact to influence the categorization of multiracial individuals.

Using data from one of the largest dating websites in the United States, we examine how monoracial daters respond to initial messages sent by multiracial daters with various White/non-White racial and ethnic makeups. We test four different theories: hypodescent, multiracial in-betweenness, White equivalence, and what we call a multiracial dividend effect. We find no evidence for the operation of hypodescent. Asian-White daters, in particular, are afforded a heightened status, and Black-White multiracials are treated as an in-between group. For a few specific multiracial gender groups, we find evidence for a dividend effect, where multiracial men and women are preferred above all other groups, including Whites.

Children's (4–13 years) and adults', both White (Study 1) and Black (Study 2; N = 387), categorizations of multiracial individuals were examined. White children (unlike Black children) more often categorized multiracial individuals as Black than as White in the absence of parentage information. White and Black adults (unlike children) more often categorized multiracial individuals as Black than as White, even when knowing the individuals' parentage. Children's rates of in‐group contact predicted their categorizations.

Abstract = {This paper explores how multiracial parents with White partners articulate narratives of ethnic and racial ‘dilution’ and cultural loss in relation to the socialization of their children. In our broader study of how multiracial parents raise their children, we found that parents commonly spoke of concerns around dilution and generational change in relation to four key themes: the loss of cultural knowledge and diminishing practices that connected parents and their children to a minority ancestry; the embodiment of White‐appearing children and the implications of this for family relationships; the use of biological or genetic discourses in relation to reduced blood quantum; and concerns amongst Black/White participants about whitening and the loss of racial consciousness. Parental understandings of dilution varied greatly; some expressed sadness at ‘inevitable’ loss; others were more philosophical about generational change; and others still proactively countered loss through strategies to connect their children to their minority heritages. We show that despite growing awareness of the social constructedness of race and an emergent cosmopolitanism among these parents, discourses of genetics, cultural lineage, and the ‘naturalness’ of race continue to hold sway amongst many multiracial parents.

Abstract = {Background: The time to first cigarette of the day (TTFC) is a strong indicator of nicotine dependence behaviors such as nicotine uptake and quit success in young and older smokers. There are substantial differences in levels of nicotine dependence by race and ethnic group. Methods: Data from Wave III of the multiracial National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were analyzed for young smokers between the ages of 21 and 28 (N = 1,425). Time to first cigarette data was compared between Hispanic, White, Black, Native American, and Asian smokers. Results: Black smokers were significantly more likely to smoke within 5 min of waking than White, Hispanic, and Asian smokers. Lower personal income predicted smoking within 5 min of waking for both White and Black smokers. For White smokers, increased number of cigarettes per day and increased years of smoking also predicted smoking within 5 min of waking. The number of days smoked or number of cigarettes per day did not predict smoking within 5 min of waking among smokers. Conclusions: The higher prevalence of early TTFC among Blacks indicates increased nicotine and carcinogen exposure, and may help explain the increased lung cancer rates and failed cessation attempts among Black smokers. TTFC may be an important screening item, independent of cigarettes per day, for clinicians and interventions to identify those at highest risk for cessation failure and disease risk.

These symptoms might be particularly evident in multiracial youth, although little research exists on this vulnerable population. A model whereby depression, dissociation, and posttraumatic cognition symptoms contributed to symptoms of PTSD met goodness-of-fit criteria in 160 maltreated multiracial adolescents. Enhanced model fit was found for females and for adolescents 11 to 13 years old. Analyses further revealed that the best predictors of PTSD symptoms were negative cognitions about the world and anhedonia. The findings are discussed within the context of existing theoretical models of PTSD. The results further highlight the importance of ethnically and racially sensitive approaches to assessment and treatment of youth with PTSD symptoms.

Abstract = {Objectives: Guided by a racial microaggression framework and utilizing a mixed-method approach, this study explores multiracial individuals’ interpersonal experiences and perceptions of racial identification inquiries—queries directed toward them as others attempt to determine their racial background (e.g., “What are you?”). Methods: As part of an online study, multiracial college students (n = 40) were presented with a hypothetical situation in which racial identification inquiries were delivered by a White, racial minority, or racially unspecified communicator. Qualitative analyses identified the categories and thematic codes of participants’ open-ended explanations of the personal relevance of these hypothetical situations and proposed endings. Nonparametric tests examined differences in situation, affect, and communication partner ratings based on race of the communicator. Results: Findings affirmed that racial identification inquiries are commonly reported by diverse multiracial individuals (92.5% of the present sample). Qualitative coding of participants’ explanations of personal relevance and proposed endings for the hypothetical situations, as well as ratings of situation, affect, and communication partner, revealed both positive and negative characterizations ascribed to racial identification inquiry experiences. Participants who imagined the queries came from a White communicator allotted less time to continuing the conversation than those in the control condition (communicator race unspecified). Conclusions: A racial microaggression framework was relevant but not sufficient in reflecting the complex nature of racial identification inquiries for multiracial individuals. The insights into multiracial individuals’ perceptions of these stimuli encourage more critical and dynamic thinking about racial categorization systems and interpersonal racial processes for this underrepresented but growing population.

Abstract = {Although multiracial individuals are the fastest growing population in the United States, research on the identity development of multiracial adolescents remains scant. This study explores the relationship between ethnic identity, its components (affirmation, exploration), and mental health outcomes (anxiety, depressive symptoms) within the contexts of schools for multiracial adolescents. The participants were multiracial and monoracial minority and majority high school students (n = 4,766; 54.6 % female). Among the participants, 88.1 % were Caucasian, 7.4 % were African American, and 4.5 % were multiracial. The research questions examined the relationship between ethnic identity exploration and affirmation on mental health outcomes and explored the role school context plays in this relationship. The findings suggested that multiracial youth experience more exploration and less affirmation than African Americans, but more than Caucasians. In addition, multiracial youth were found to have higher levels of mental health issues than their monoracial minority and majority peers. Specifically, multiracial youth had higher levels of depressive symptoms than their African American and Caucasian counterparts. Multiracial and Caucasian youth had similar levels of anxiety but these levels were significantly higher than African Americans. School diversity did not influence mental health outcomes for multiracial youth. These findings provide insight into the experiences of multiracial youth and underscore the importance of further investigating factors that contribute to their mental health outcomes.

Methods: Using the 2005 Youth Culture Survey data set, we test our theoretical expectations using descriptive statistics and multiple regression models. Results: The relationship between racial identification and out‐group attitudes varies among racial groups; specifically, racial identity variables do not have a significant impact on whites’ out‐group attitudes, but they do matter for blacks and Hispanics. Conclusion: While American society has changed in many ways (i.e., increased number of minorities and more tolerance, or at least more discussion of acceptance, for racial groups), our research finds that race still plays a consequential role in the lives of young racial minorities.

Abstract = {Within the Asian American narrative, one part that is regularly excluded is the story of mixed race Asian Americans. Despite the fact that mixed race Asians, also known as Hapas, make up 15% of the Asian American community and are one of the largest subgroups according to Pew Research Center, they have not been given an equal place in cultural organizations, community leadership, and academic research. According to Beverly Yuen Thompson (2000), "Within the 'Asian American experience' there is a great deal of diversity that has thus far remained unexplored. Issues of interracial relationships, transracial adoptions, biracial identity, and queer identity have remained marginalized and considered exceptions to an unspoken norm of Asian American identity". Since Asian Americans are defined by a monolithic term and are viewed by American society as a single entity, any deviations from this normative definition have been excluded. For many Hapa students in college, their cultural and racial differences have resulted in a general exclusion from Asian American and other single-race groups and harsher criticism under the model minority myth (MMM). Through a single, in-depth vignette, our chapter examines the influence of this exclusion and how the MMM operates to hamper student confidence and opportunities to connect with other students on campus, ultimately eroding the quality of the college experience. Additionally, it attempts to shine a light on the mixed race Asian American community and to make a case for why these stories are important in the overall landscape of educational research on Asian Americans and other non-dominant minority groups in general. A discussion of implications and recommendations for greater awareness and sensitivity to mixed-race students and their development in student programming and services as well as questions for further reflection follow. The following question guided our overall inquiry and analysis: What are the stories—perceived and experienced challenges—of those who identify as Hapa during college?

Abstract = {Our struggle to explore what it means to be an Asian Pacific Islander (API) educator in the United States started when a small group of us came together to envision a class specifically designed for API educators. Four months later, history was made, at least for us. A course conceptualized by API educators for API educators was taught for the first time, as far as we know, at a major university in the United States. Of course, this is not the type of history that will make its way into textbooks. Nor is it the type of history that more than a dozen or so people will remember. But it was a historical moment for us precisely because we embarked on a journey that reminded us that "history is not the past; it is the stories we tell about the past". It was a recognition that the stories we had told about our past, which seemed so simple and true, were often not our own. We began listening for the incongruities, the ambiguities. There were soon multiple storylines, rather than Just one. Some tapered off, others rejoined. There were stories of solidarity, and there were stories of strife. There were stories of hope, and there were stories of pain. There were stories that brought clarity, and there were stories that seeded uncertainty. Ultimately, though, we realized that stories are not simply about remembering the past. They are also about understanding the present and charting the future. They are about becoming. So. we share our stories of becoming API educators. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {The U.S. Census shows that the racial-ethnic makeup of over 9 million people (2.9% of the total population) who self-identified as multiracial is extremely diverse. Each multiracial subgroup has unique social and political histories that may lead to distinct societal perceptions, economic situations, and health outcomes. Despite the increasing academic and media interest in multiracial individuals, there are methodological and definitional challenges in studying the population, resulting in conflicting representations in the literature. This content and methods review of articles on multiracial populations provides a comprehensive understanding of which multiracial populations have been included in research and how they have been studied, both to recognize emerging research and to identify gaps for guiding future research on this complex but increasingly visible population. We examine 125 U.S.-based peer-reviewed journal articles published over the past 20 years (1990 to 2009) containing 133 separate studies focused on multiracial individuals, primarily from the fields of psychology, sociology, social work, education, and public health. Findings include (a) descriptive data regarding the sampling strategies, methodologies, and demographic characteristics of studies, including which multiracial subgroups are most studied, gender, age range, region of country, and socioeconomic status; (b) major thematic trends in research topics concerning multiracial populations; and (c) implications and recommendations for future studies.

Abstract = {Multiracial individuals often do not easily fit into existing racial categories. Perceivers may adopt a novel racial category to categorize multiracial targets, but their willingness to do so may depend on their motivations. We investigated whether perceivers’ levels of internal motivation to control prejudice (IMS) and external motivation to control prejudice (EMS) predicted their likelihood of categorizing Black–White multiracial faces as Multiracial. Across four studies, IMS positively predicted perceivers’ categorizations of multiracial faces as Multiracial. The association between IMS and Multiracial categorizations was strongest when faces were most racially ambiguous. Explicit prejudice, implicit prejudice, and interracial contact were ruled out as explanations for the relationship between IMS and Multiracial categorizations. EMS may be negatively associated with the use of the Multiracial category. Therefore, perceivers’ motivations to control prejudice have important implications for racial categorization processes.

Abstract = {Multiracial Americans, people who belong to more than one racial group in the United States, also belong to more than one culture, yet multiracial and multicultural research and theory has not been adequately integrated. The present chapter will provide an overview of the multiracial and multicultural research on self and identity that addresses the points of overlap, distinction, and places for synthesis and integration that could advance both areas of research. For example, this chapter will examine the relationship among different strategies that utilize multiple identities and health outcomes (e.g., identity integration, identity adaptiveness, identity shifting, dialecticalism). In addition, this chapter will explore the common questions of authenticity and forced-choice encounters that those from multiple races and cultures face (e.g., "Are you American or Asian?"). Integrating multicultural and multiracial research, the authors propose the identity autonomy perspective (IAP) wherein the antecedents and outcomes of identity denial are discussed for both multicultural and multiracial populations. Specifically, we will examine how societal essentialism and personal attributes (e.g., physical appearance, cultural practices, social status) promote identity-denial experiences that thwart autonomy for both multicultural and multiracial populations.

Abstract = {Monoracial people typically encounter correct views about their race from others. Multiracial people, however, encounter different views about their race depending on the situation. As a result, multiracial (but not monoracial) people may regard race as a less visible aspect of the self that they hope others will verify during social interactions. Multiracial people should therefore value others’ accuracy about their race more than monoracial people. In Study 1, multiracial and monoracial participants expected to meet a partner who was accurate or confused about their racial backgrounds. Multiracial (but not monoracial) participants reported heightened interest in interacting with an accurate partner. In Study 2, multiracial (but not monoracial) participants perceived accurate partners as more likely than confused partners to fulfill their needs for self-verification during an interaction. Increased expectations for self-verification, moreover, explained multiracial (but not monoracial) participants’ heightened interest in interacting with accurate partners. The results suggest that multiracial (but not monoracial) people view race as an aspect of the self (like personality traits or values) requiring verification from others during interactions.

Angela Onwuachi-Willig has written a compelling book about the significance that the Rhinelander v. Rhinelander annulment case has for modern day mixed-race families. It reads like two books in one, which if anything, allows it to bridge the stories of mixedrace families through time. Drawing upon evidence from the Rhinelander trial and other publicity regarding the case, she explains in part one, the pressures the parties were put through when they married across the color line. Ounwuachi-Willig offers an important discussion of modern anti-discrimination law in the housing and employment contexts, as she explains how each body of doctrine impacts where mixedrace families might live, and whether they might provide for their families. Yet, each type of anti-discrimination law has limitations in their ability to protect rights. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Moreover, among multiracial adolescents, identity, usually measured in school, is correlated with achievement. In addition, a few studies have indicated that for half-white, half-minority adolescents, school achievement falls in between the achievements of their monoracial counterparts. Using the in-school and in-home components of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we examine the relationship between racial self-identification and school belonging and achievement. We find that among black/white and Asian/white adolescents, adolescents who self-identify as white are particularly disadvantaged in school, reporting lower grade point averages (GPA) than their multiracial counterparts. Our conclusions suggest that multiple contextual measures of self-identification better capture the relationship between racial identification and academic achievement among multiracial adolescents.

Abstract = {Although multiracial youth represent a growing segment of children in all American families, we have little information on their well-being within single-mother households. This article examines multiracial children’s level of poverty within single-mother families to identify the degree to which they may stand out from their monoracial peers. Using data from the 2006–2008 American Community Survey (3-year estimates), we explore the level of racial disparities in child poverty between monoracial White children and monoracial and multiracial children of color. Fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses (n = 359,588) reveal that nearly all children of color are more likely to be poor than White children. Yet many multiracial children appear to hold an in-between status in which they experience lower rates of poverty than monoracial children of color. The high level of variation across groups suggests that the relationship between race and childhood poverty is more complicated than generally presumed.

Abstract = {This study investigates the degree to which African-American households are socially integrated into a multiracial, middle-class suburban neighborhood near Dallas, Texas. Although U.S. neighborhoods are becoming increasingly heterogeneous in composition, little is known about black households' participation in social and informational networks within multiracial middle-class neighborhoods. Drawing on theories of the gift and social capital, we view neighborhoods in terms of complex patterns of inter-household exchanges of material and symbolic goods. We predict that black-led households will exchange at a lower rate with their neighbors than will other households and test this prediction using survey data collected from 119 households and from follow-up interviews with eight black heads of household. Our main finding from the survey is that black households exchanged at a significantly lower rate than did other households, ceteris paribus. The follow-up interviews found little evidence of black racial homophily in neighboring or of racism within the neighborhood. However, the low rate of black inter-household exchanges may be partly explained by black head of households' personal experiences of racism outside the neighborhood and by a racially constituted disposition against borrowing from neighbors. We discuss implications of our findings for research on racial integration and segregation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The racial and ethnic diversity among the participants at the research settings further complicated how researcher identity influenced these processes. We want to reimagine the role of the researcher of color when conducting research about and with communities of color. We suggest that researchers can act as critical participants to create opportunities for dialog about racism, sexism, and other inequities in educational settings.

Abstract = {The U.S, population has witnessed considerable social, cultural, and demographic changes in recent decades. For centuries, the United States has attracted people from all over the world who are searching for their share of the American dream. Beginning as early as the 1600s with the Mayflower, U.S. history is full of stories of immigration. As a result, the United States is filled with a mosaic of races and nationalities. Youth of racial and ethnic minorities, including those of color; immigrant youth, and biraclal youth, experience a variety of internal and external challenges. There are numerous unique characteristics, potential problems, and social needs for those with mixed cultural heritage. These challenges are related to a need to define identities in a society that is often harsh in response to social dimensions outside of the mainstream. Considerable attention must be focused on providing counseling services to racial and ethnic minority youth and those with combined heritage. Some issues that are pertinent to working with these populations include racial and ethnic identity development, isolation, career dreams, and academic and behavioral concerns (Harris, 2002; Herring, 1992; Moss & Davis, 2008), A counselor's multicultural knowledge, awareness, and skills In working with people from diverse backgrounds are critical to effective counseling. It Is clear from research that racial and ethnic minorities are more vulnerable to social, emotional, and academic problems and that limited support systems are available to racial and ethnic minority youth (Esquivel & Keitel, 1990; Moss & Davis, 2008), This chapter addresses stressors encountered by these minority youth and issues pertinent to counseling, A case study is provided as well as suggestions for prevention and intervention strategies, (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class (N = 17,706), we evaluated the likelihood of living in poverty and near poverty for multiracial and monoracial children. Most multiracial groups have poverty or near poverty rates that are in between Whites and their respective minority monoracial counterparts, with Asian-Whites reporting a risk of poverty equivalent to Whites and Black-Hispanics reporting risks as high as Black and Hispanic children. Family structure and educational and occupational attainment characteristics explain some or all of the White/non-White differentials in poverty for multiracial groups, even as monoracial children still exhibit higher risk than Whites. We consider these patterns’ implications for practitioners working with low-income families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to explore the intersection of identity, culture, and consumption as it relates to multiracial identity development. Methodology/approach: The authors employed a phenomenological approach wherein 21 multiracial women were interviewed to understanding the lived experience and meaning of multiracial identity development. Findings: Findings of this study indicate that multiracial consumers engage with the marketplace to assuage racial discordance and legitimize the liminal space they occupy. Research implications: While there is much research related to the variety of ways marketing and consumption practices intersect with identity (re)formation, researchers have focused much of their attention on monoracial populations. This research identifies and fills a gap in the literature related to how multiple racial backgrounds complicate this understanding. Practical implications: Due to their growing social visibility and recognized buying power, multiracial individuals have emerged as a viable consumer segment among marketers. However, there is a dearth of research examining how multiracial populations experience the marketplace. Originality/value: This study provides a better understanding of the ways in which multiracial individuals utilize consumption practices as a means of developing and expressing their racial identity.

Abstract = {A total of 1627 school counselors from all 50 states and the District of Columbia participated in a study designed to investigate their personal perceptions of multiracial individuals. Results indicated that school counselors held a wide variety of perceptions and those with 1 to 5 years of experience were more likely to believe that multiracial students experienced more academic and behavioral problems. Middle school counselors were more likely to believe that multiracial students have a more difficult time adjusting to society. School counselors who were unsure if cultural diversity and awareness programs were promoted in their school were also unsure if the physical appearance of multiracial students impacted how they racially identified themselves. Finally, school counselors in schools with a Very Diverse student body believed that multiracial students would experience fewer problems related to identity development if they lived in a diverse community. They also believed the problems experienced by multiracial students were related to identity conflicts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Contemporary discussions of race in the USA fall somewhere along a spectrum anchored, on the one end, by ideologies rooted in notions of color blindness/postraciality and adherence to the ideology of identity politics, on the other. Meanwhile, the racialized social structure, dividing the resources, opportunities, and experiences along racial lines, grounded as it is in an interactional order mapped along a color complex, continues quite unabated. It is in this context that multiracial individuals navigate color in the twenty-first century. Where do various groups of multiracial individuals fall along this tenuously balanced social schema? How do they narrate the roles of skin color, phenotype, and appearance in their daily lives? This chapter presents data on three groups of multiracial individuals in an attempt to understand these and related questions. The scripts and discourse about the role and importance of skin tone in American life have been developed for hundreds of years, and the political, cultural, social, historical, emplaced, and embodied institutional grooves have been set. It behooves us to continue to ask how such scripts are utilized or challenged in the twenty-first century and what, if any, new grammars are deployed by continually racialized beings such as multiracial individuals in the USA. Bringing together interview data of three groups of multiracial individuals, we are interested, in this chapter, in the ways that Black-White, Asian-White, and Hispanic-White multiracials use, resist, and reinvent these scripts as they discuss the role of color or appearance in their daily experiences.

Abstract = {Like other racial minority groups, multiracial people face discrimination as a function of their racial identity, and this discrimination represents a threat to psychological well-being. Following the Rejection-Identification Model (RIM; Branscombe, Schmitt, & Harvey, 1999), we argue that perceived discrimination will encourage multiracial people to identify more strongly with other multiracials, and that multiracial identification, in turn, fosters psychological well-being. Thus, multiracial identification is conceptualized as a coping response that reduces the overall costs of discrimination on well-being. This study is the first to test the RIM in a sample of multiracial people. Multiracial participants' perceptions of discrimination were negatively related to life satisfaction. Consistent with the RIM, perceived discrimination was positively related to three aspects of multiracial group identification: stereotyping the self as similar to other multiracial people, perceiving people within the multiracial category as more homogenous, and expressing solidarity with the multiracial category. Self-stereotyping was the only aspect of group identification that mediated a positive relationship between perceived discrimination and life satisfaction, suggesting that multiracial identification's protective properties rest in the fact that it provides an collective identity where one “fits.” (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Worship Across the Racial Divide: Religious Music and the Multiracial Congregation by Gerardo Marti (2012). Over the past two decades, religious leaders across the spectrum of faith systems and political ideologies have been active, enthusiastic participants in a range of antiracist and racial reconciliation projects, interfaith initiatives, and cross racial coalitions intended to increase racial diversity both within their own communities and across the American religious landscape. This book puts music at the center of these efforts. Marti’s attention to music is timely, important, and eminently sociological. A common thread among many successfully integrated churches appears to be the incorporation of cross-cultural musical styles, and a large number of church leaders—professional staff and lay people alike—see music and music directors as foundational for the accomplishment of diversity. Among the most basic contributions of cross-cultural music is that creating it helps to diversify church leadership and makes color conspicuous for congregants and visitors alike. These are steps that churches and church leaders can be quite intentional about. On this score it is also important to understand how prominently on display musicians and choir members are in many churches and worship settings—often positioned right up front for all to see. Worship across the Racial Divide has as much to teach about the paradoxes and challenges of racial integration as about religion, worship, or church music.

Abstract = {Research has found that attending a racially diverse congregation promotes more favorable attitudes toward interracial dating, marriage, and adoption, but does participation in an integrated faith community promote tolerance toward other non-traditional romantic and family forms? This study examines the relationship between involvement in a racially diverse congregation and support for same-sex romantic and family relationships. Data are taken from the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey. I fit logistic regression models to estimate the effect of attending a multiracial church on support for homosexuality, same-sex marriage, and same-sex adoption, net of sociodemographic and religious controls. Results indicate that persons who attend churches where between 25 and 75 percent of attendees are of another race are more likely to support gay sex, marriage, and adoption compared with those who attend more racially homogenous churches. This relationship generally holds when models are estimated for evangelicals and mainline Protestants separately, but not for Catholics. Findings suggest a link between religion-based racial prejudice and heterosexism/homophobia and that increased exposure to racial diversity may promote a general tolerance toward non-traditional romantic couples and families.

Abstract = {Multiracial youth are thought to be more vulnerable to peer-related risk factors than are single-race youth. However, there have been surprisingly few well-designed studies on this topic. This study empirically investigated the extent to which multiracial youth are at higher risk for peer influenced problem behavior. Data are from a representative and longitudinal sample of youth from Washington State (N = 1,760, mean age = 14.13, 50.9% girls). Of those in the sample, 225 youth self-identified as multiracial (12.8%), 1,259 as White (71.5%), 152 as Latino (8.6%), and 124 as Asian American (7.1%). Results show that multiracial youth have higher rates of violence and alcohol use than Whites and more marijuana use than Asian Americans. Higher levels of socioeconomic disadvantage and single-parent family status partly explained the higher rates of problem behaviors among multiracial youth. Peer risk factors of substance-using or antisocial friends were higher for multiracial youth than Whites, even after socioeconomic variables were accounted for, demonstrating a higher rate of peer risks among multiracial youth. The number of substance-using friends was the most consistently significant correlate and predictor of problems and was highest among multiracial youth. However, interaction tests did not provide consistent evidence of a stronger influence of peer risks among multiracial youth. Findings underscore the importance of a differentiated understanding of vulnerability in order to better target prevention and intervention efforts as well as the need for further research that can help identify and explain the unique experiences and vulnerabilities of multiracial youth.

Abstract = {Most Racial Studies primarily focus on African Americans without paying attention to nonblack minorities, and it fails to capture recent increase in racial diversity. Based on previous theories and empirical findings, we propose a new model, minority comparison model, which accounts for theoretical shortcomings in Racial Studies. This model (1) captures psychological processes that compare blacks and nonblacks, and (2) explores the effects of whites’ multiracial evaluation on racialized policy preferences. Drawing on a 2008 national representative sample, this study finds that whites who have positive stereotype of nonblacks (e.g., Hispanics and/or Asians) but negative stereotype of blacks show substantially higher symbolic racism and stronger opposition to Affirmative Action, whereas whites who have positive stereotype of blacks but negative stereotypes of nonblacks have stronger opposition to expansive immigration policy. Our study offers new ways of understanding and accounting for symbolic racism in modern context, and shows how whites’ preferences in racialized policies are influenced by multiracial evaluation.

Abstract = {This study examined relations between perceived racial discrimination, multiracial identity integration (i.e., racial distance and racial conflict), and psychological adjustment (i.e., distress symptoms, positive affect, and negative affect) of 263 multiracial adults, using an online cross-sectional survey design. As hypothesized, higher levels of perceived racial discrimination was related to lower levels of psychological adjustment (i.e., higher distress symptoms and negative affect). Also, higher levels of multiracial identity integration with low racial conflict was related to higher levels of psychological adjustment (i.e., lower distress symptoms and negative affect), whereas higher levels of multiracial identity integration with low racial distance was related to higher levels of psychological adjustment (i.e., lower negative affect). Finally, multiracial identity integration (i.e., lower racial conflict) moderated the relationship between perceived racial discrimination and psychological adjustment (i.e., negative affect) with results suggesting multiracial identity integration related to low racial conflict buffers the negative effects of perceived racial discrimination on psychological adjustment. Findings from this study are discussed in terms of future research on the psychological well-being of multiracial individuals and implications for clinical practice with multiracial adults.

Abstract = {Contact theory holds that increased contact between members of different groups can improve intergroup attitudes and reduce prejudice if it meets certain quality criteria, such as equal status, common goals, and cooperation within the contact situation. It is now emerging that even extended contact, or the mere knowledge that an ingroup member has a close relationship with an outgroup member, can lead to more positive intergroup attitudes. However, in South African society optimal contact is uncommon because most social spaces and structures are governed by strong norms of microsegregation that ensure that genuine optimal contact is uncommon. Given that multiracial families exemplify most features of optimal contact while radically challenging social norms of segregation, they may be important nodes for effective prejudice-reducing contact in South African society. This exploratory study investigated the extent to which general contact with people of other races, direct contact with multiracial families (i.e. personally knowing a member of a multiracial family), and extended contact with multiracial families (i.e. knowing someone who knows a member of a multiracial family) predicted reduced prejudice, reconciliatory race-policy attitudes and reduced intergroup threat. The results show that all three forms of contact predicted significantly reduced prejudice and that direct contact with multiracial families significantly predicted reduced prejudice over and above the effect of general interracial contact. Therefore we argue that contact researchers should consider more carefully whether normatively supported contact or radically norm-violating forms of contact optimally disrupt practices of microsegregation. Additionally, we argue that multiracial romantic relationships and families deserve increased attention and support as important nodes of prejudice reduction in South African society. However, general contact was also associated with reduced support for race-based social policies which supports the argument that the prejudice-reducing effects of interracial contact may be at least partially offset by other effects that may hinder broader social change.

To date, few psychological measures have been created specifically to investigate the experiences of multiracial people. This article describes 2 studies focused on the development and psychometric properties of the Multiracial Challenges and Resilience Scale (MCRS). The MCRS was developed using a nationwide Internet sample of urban, multiracial adults. Exploratory factor analyses revealed 4 Challenge factors (Others' Surprise and Disbelief Regarding Racial Heritage, Lack of Family Acceptance, Multiracial Discrimination, and Challenges With Racial Identity) and 2 Resilience factors (Appreciation of Human Differences and Multiracial Pride). A confirmatory factor analysis with data from a second sample provided support for the stability of this factor structure.

Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander adolescents had the higher prevalence of risk factors for suicide. Multiracial adolescents were also at high risk for suicide-related behaviors, with a risk comparable to American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents. Overall, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, multiracial, and American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents reported a significantly higher risk for suicide-related behaviors compared to their Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White peers. The ethnic disparities in risk factors for suicide dictate a need to understand the vulnerability of the Pacific Islander, American Indian, and growing multiracial adolescent populations, in an effort to develop and implement suicide prevention strategies.

Abstract = {The growing presence and visibility of mixed race persons in the US demands that social workers critically examine and understand the complexity of multiracial identity. This qualitative investigation examined the narratives of ten multiracial adults about their identity experiences living as multiracial persons. Utilizing paradigmatic analysis of narratives, five major themes emerged. Four of these themes correspond to categories found in existing multiracial scholarship, and include: (1) Shifting racial/ethnic expressions; (2) Racial/ethnic ambiguity; (3) Feeling like an outsider; and (4) Seeking community. The final theme, (5) Racial resistance, contributes new knowledge to our understanding of how multiracial individuals respond to societal pressures to conform to traditional means of categorizing others by race. Findings from this study confirm a collective multiracial experience; one with direct ties to the social and environmental pressures associated with having a multifaceted identity in a color-conscious society.

Abstract = {During the same time period, the United States, Great Britain and Canada all moved towards ‘counting’ mixed-race on their national censuses. In the United States, this move is largely attributed to the existence of a mixed-race social movement that pushed Congress for the change—but similar developments in Canada and Britain occurred without the presence of a politically active civil society devoted to making the change. Why the convergence? This article argues that demographic trends, increasingly unsettled perceptions about discrete racial categories, and a transnational norm surrounding the primacy of racial self-identification in census-taking culminated in a normative shift towards multiracial multiculturalism. Therein, mixed-race identities are acknowledged as part of—rather than problematic within—diverse societies. These elements enabled mixed-race to be promoted, at times strategically, as a corollary of multiculturalism in these three countries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This qualitative study explored how critical incidents shape multiracial students' understanding of race and identity at predominantly White institutions. Participants included 14 multiracial undergraduate students from two institutions in the Midwest. Four categories of critical incidents were identified from the data: (a) confronting race and racism, (b) responding to external definitions, (c) defending legitimacy, and (d) affirming racial identity. The incidents took many forms and occurred in many contexts. The majority of incidents involved interactions with other students, underscoring the influence of peers. The study also suggests implications for higher education practice and research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {According to the 2010 U.S. census, approximately 9 million individuals report multiracial identities. By the year 2050, as many as one in five Americans could claim a multiracial background. Despite this population growth, a review of recent empirical and theoretical literature in social work suggests a disproportionate lack of attention to issues of multiraciality. Instead, social work practice models remain embedded in traditional societal discourses of race and culture that often exclude or marginalize the experiences of multiracial individuals and families. This article summarizes recommendations following the domains of awareness, knowledge, and skills in the NASW Standards for Cultural Competence in Social Work Practice to support culturally attuned social work practice with multiracial people. The authors argue that a culturally attuned practice approach—one that is inclusive of multiraciality—is not only timely, but also consistent with the profession’s ethical obligation to provide culturally relevant services to all consumers and clients.

Abstract = {Multiracial/multiethnic queer and transgender clients present with unique opportunities for counselors and psychologists to explore the intersection of not only their multiple identity development processes but also how these intersections are sites of resilience and liberation. Multiracial/multiethnic queer and transgender clients may face numerous challenges because of their multiple identities. Clients may often feel caught between two (or more) worlds such that they feel acceptance of their queer or transgender identity in one area of their life but feel they need to hide or refrain from sharing other salient identities. Queer and transgender multiracial/multiethnic clients may also endure and/or have internalized a tremendous number of societal stereotypes based on race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. However, in addition to exploring these many barriers to well-being, counselors may work with queer and transgender multiracial/multiethnic clients to collaboratively identify the unique resilience and coping strategies these clients have developed despite these barriers. This chapter presents two case studies (one queer case study from a cognitive behavior therapy theoretical lens and one transgender case study from a narrative theoretical lens) in order to further explore how counselors may work with common issues that arise in counseling these clients. Throughout both case studies we use a feminist and social justice framework in order to identify issues of power, privilege, and oppression within both the counseling relationship and the experiences the clients have had in society that influence their well-being. We also integrate the Competencies for Counseling Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered (LGBT) Clients (ALGBTIC, 1997) and the Competencies for Counseling With Transgender Clients of the Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues in Counseling (ALGBTIC, 2010) in our discussion of the case studies (see Appendixes A and B, respectively).

Abstract = {Objective: We examine historical changes from 1992 to 2008 in the severity of dementia and accompanying neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons presenting for evaluation and treatment at a multiracial urban dementia center. Methods: We reviewed intakes of white (n = 197) and black (n = 568) patients seen at a dementia center in New York City. Intakes were divided into 3 time categories: period 1 (1992 to 1996), period 2 (1997 to 2002), and period 3 (2003 to 2008). Diagnoses included the following: Alzheimer disease (73%), vascular dementia (13%), mixed dementia (9%), mild cognitive impairment (2%), and other dementias (4%). Results: Over the 3 assessment periods, persons increasingly presented at an earlier stage of illness with significantly higher levels of cognition and functioning, and a declining prevalence of psychotic symptoms and agitation. Blacks had a more advanced stage of illness, lower cognitive scores, and a greater prevalence of psychotic symptoms than whites in period 1, but not during the other time periods. There were no racial differences in functioning, agitation, or depression. Conclusion: Over the period 1992 to 2008, patients were increasingly more likely to present with early stages of dementia and fewer symptoms of psychoses and agitation, and racial differences in illness severity and neuropsychiatric symptoms disappeared. If our sample reflects trends in the United States, then it suggests that more persons will be in care for longer periods of time, previous research findings derived from dementia centers must be considered historically specific, and clinicians must be prepared to work with persons with milder forms of neurocognitive disorders.

We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 to compare family characteristics of adolescents of a mixed-race or multiethnic background with those of a monoracial or monoethnic background. Mixed-race or multiethnic youth reported feeling less supported by parents and reported less satisfactory parent-adolescent relationships.

Abstract = {Given the historical legacy of de jure and contemporary de facto segregation in the U.S., scholars have taken up the call toward more democratic education through analyses in which race and racism become focused lenses for studying oppression (Bell, 1992; Solórzano & Yosso, 2002; Ladson- Billings & Tate, 1995). Two significant bodies of literature have simultaneously developed as methods for studying (and combating) race and racism. This chapter centralizes Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Critical Whiteness Studies (CWS) as two complementary yet distinctive bodies of literature that have emerged to address racialized systems of oppression. I centralize these two bodies as the consideration of both provides important implications for how racial pedagogy is taught and articulated in ways that inform social justice leadership. Building on the work of some of the key foundational texts of CRT and CWS scholars (Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995; Crenshaw, 1995; Solórzano, 1998; Gillborn, 2005; Leonardo, 2009; Wise, 2005; Thompson, 2003), my intention is to provide critique as a form of further engagement, as I claim that neither literature base has effectively problematized the monolithic categories of race that it seeks to represent. Because the foundational texts are often initial sites of entry for students learning about critical theory and racialized topics, I will show that this essentializing phenomenon is not surprising as it is symptomatic of the larger racial system of White supremacy; yet, without deeper critiques of monolithic narratives, a racist system persists and thrives.

Abstract = {Understanding the perception of multiracial persons is increasingly important in today's diverse society. The present research investigated the process of categorizing multiracial persons as “Multiracial.” We hypothesized that perceivers would make fewer Multiracial categorizations of multiracials and that these categorizations would take longer than monoracial categorizations. We found support for these hypotheses across six experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrated that perceivers did not categorize morphed Black–White faces as Multiracial with the same frequency with which they categorized Black and White faces as Black and White (respectively), and that categorizations of multiracials as Multiracial took longer than monoracial categorizations. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these effects to real Black–White faces. Experiment 3 showed that these findings generalized to Asian–White faces. We used pixel variance analysis to show that these effects were not due to increased variance among Multiracial faces. The image analysis showed that the Black–White morphs and real biracials were actually less varied than either the Black or White sets of faces. Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrated that cognitive load and time constraints detrimentally affected multiracial, but not monoracial, categorizations. Experiment 6 showed that imbuing monoracial categories with importance decreases the use of the Multiracial category. Implications of these findings for understanding perceptions of multiracial persons are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objectives: Obesity is an issue of concern among patients with schizophrenia as it is a co-morbid condition that is closely related to metabolic syndrome. The present study assessed the correlation of body mass index with antipsychotic use among multiracial schizophrenia outpatients. The study also compared the patients' body mass index with Malaysian Adult Nutrition Survey (MANS) data. Methods: A total of 216 participants were recruited into a cross-sectional study conducted over 5 months, from December 2010 to April 2011. Body weight and height were measured using the standard methods. Demographic data and treatment variables were gathered through interview or review of the medical records. Results: There were differences in mean body mass index between men and women (p = 0.02) and between Malay, Chinese and Indian races (p = 0.04). Stratified by sex, age, and race, the body mass index distributions of the patients were significantly different to those of the reference MANS population. The prevalence of obesity among patients was more than 2-fold greater than among the reference population in all variables. Although body mass index distribution was related to antipsychotic drugs (χ² = 33.42; p = 0.04), obesity could not be attributed to any specific drug. Conclusion: The prevalence of obesity among patients with schizophrenia was significantly greater than that in the healthy Malaysian population, and affects the 3 main races in Malaysia.

Abstract = {I use multiple perspectives on the racial order in the United States to generate hypotheses about the social position of mixed-race groups. Perspectives that view the racial order as binary, ternary with an undifferentiated middle, or ternary with a stratified middle present different expectations for the social position of multiracial groups. I use a group’s level of residential segregation as an index of social position. In 2000, multiracial persons lived in neighbourhoods that were more white than the neighbourhoods of single-race minorities, though more diverse than the neighbourhoods of whites. Thus, multiracial groups appear to occupy an intermediate social position relative to blacks and whites, a finding that supports contemporary arguments about shifting colour-lines in the United States and the emergence of a triracial system of stratification. Yet, findings also suggest that the social space between blacks and whites is, itself, racially stratified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Social scientists have become increasingly interested in the racial identification choices of multiracial individuals, partly as a result of the federal government’s new “check all that apply” method of racial identification. However, the majority of work to date has narrowly defined the population of multiracial individuals as the “biracial” children of single-race parents. In this article, we use the open-ended ancestry questions on the 1990 and 2000 5% samples of the US Census to identify a multiracial population that is potentially broader in its understanding of multiraciality. Relative to other studies, we find stronger historical continuity in the patterns of hypodescent and hyperdescent for part-black and part-American Indian ancestry individuals respectively, while we find that multiple-race identification is the modal category for those of part-Asian ancestry. We interpret this as evidence of a new, more flexible classification regime for groups rooted in more recent immigration. Our results suggest that future work on multiracial identification must pay closer attention to the varied histories of specific multiracial ancestry groups.

Abstract = {The growing prominence of the multiracial population in the United States is prompting new questions about attitudes toward multiracial people and popular opinion of policies designed to protect them from discrimination. Currently, American anti-discrimination policies are directed at groups who identify with a single race, but the rising profile of multiracial groups introduces new complexity into questions about racial policy. In this study, we find generally positive affect toward multiracial people, although monoracial minorities are more positive toward multiracial people than whites are. About half of the monoracial minorities and the majority of whites oppose including multiracial people in anti-discrimination policies. Attitudes are associated with traditional predictors such as education and political beliefs, and also with the racial heterogeneity of the local context and intimate contact with other racial groups. Although multiracial people report experiencing discrimination at levels similar to those of monoracial minorities, our results suggest there may be significant resistance to anti-discrimination policies that include multiracial groups.

Abstract = {Purpose: Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a particularly debilitating disorder characterized by early onset, chronic course, and significant comorbidity. People with OCD often delay or are unwilling to seek treatment. The aim of the study was to establish the prevalence and correlates of obsessive compulsive disorder in the Singapore population, to determine types of obsessive compulsive (O/C) symptoms, the comorbidity of the disorder and to examine the quality of life among those with OCD. Methods: The Singapore Mental Health Study was a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of the adult, resident Singapore population. Face-to-face interviews were completed with 6,616 respondents between December 2009 and December 2010 giving a survey response rate of 75.9%. The diagnoses of lifetime and 12-month mental disorders were established using Version 3.0 of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-3.0); clinical severity of cases in past 12-months was assessed using a fully structured version of the Yale-Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale and functional impairment was assessed by using the disease specific Sheehan Disability Scale, which are incorporated in the CIDI. Health-related quality of life was measured using the Euro-Quality of Life Scale. Results: The lifetime and 12-month prevalence of OCD was 3.0 and 1.1%, respectively. Younger age and marital status (divorced or separated) were significantly associated with OCD. About 40 % of respondents with lifetime OCD met criteria for other lifetime mental disorders, while 51.6% of respondents with lifetime OCD had a comorbid physical disorder. The mean score of EQ-Index (0.89) and EQ-VAS (75.58) were lowest in OCD cases as compared with those with any other mental or physical disorders. The proportion of those with lifetime OCD who had sought treatment was 10.2%. Conclusions: While OCD is not an extremely prevalent disorder, it has a profound impact on quality of life and daily activities of those suffering from the disorder. The large treatment gap among those with OCD and the significant delay in seeking treatment after the onset of the illness makes OCD a disorder of significant public health priority.

Abstract = {This article explores the racial/ethnic identities of multiracial Black-Mexicans or “Blaxicans.” In-depth interviews with 12 Blaxican individuals in California reveal how they negotiate distinct cultural systems to accomplish multiracial identities. I argue that choosing, accomplishing, and asserting a Blaxican identity challenges the dominant monoracial discourse in the United States, in particular among African American and Chicana/o communities. That is, Blaxican respondents are held accountable by African Americans and Chicanas/os/Mexicans to monoracial notions of “authenticity.” The process whereby Blaxicans move between these monoracial spaces to create multiracial identities illustrates crucial aspects of the social construction of race/ethnicity in the United States and the influence of social interactions in shaping how Blaxicans develop their multiracial identities.

Abstract = {The study of the identity processes of women of color in science-based fields helps us (a) find ways to support similar women, and (b) study the dynamics of inequity, within and beyond science. Participants in this study (a Black woman, a Latina, and an American Indian woman) survived inadequate high schools and discouraging college science departments to win formal recognition (fellowships, publications). Using multiracial feminist theory, including intersectionality, and practice theory, we conceptualize authoring of identity as an ongoing process. Qualitative methods were designed around Black feminist precepts of caring and personal accountability, the use of concrete experience and of dialogue (Collins, 2000a). Participants' opportunities to author legitimate science identities were constrained by their location in the matrix of oppression. They reported conflicts between their identities as women of color and as credible science students, and having racist, sexist identities ascribed to them. All became more adept at fending off negative ascription and all found settings with less identity conflict; their ability to read a situation and quickly adjust, la facultad (Anzaldúa, 1999) helped them survive. But the fact that they have needed to do this is unjust. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Existing studies indicate that multiracial adolescents face greater substance use rates than monoracial adolescents. However, it is unclear whether the risk identified in adolescence persists into adulthood. The current study uses data from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey to analyze the alcohol and tobacco use of multiracial adolescents and adults compared to European American, African American, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander American, and Latino American individuals. Results generally support the hypothesis that multiracial adolescents and adults face higher rates of substance use than African American and Asian/Pacific Islander American individuals, though this pattern of results was reversed in comparison with Native Americans and European Americans, and less consistent compared to Latino Americans. We further establish and discuss the correlates of drinking and smoking behavior for mixed-race individuals—comparing them to other racial groups.

Abstract = {Although race is one of the most salient status characteristics in American society, many observers cannot distinguish the racial ancestries of multiracial youth. This paper examines how people perceive multiracial adolescents: specifically, I investigate whether observers perceive the adolescents as multiracial and whether these racial perceptions are congruent with the multiracial adolescents’ self-identifications. Results show that 1) observers perceived close to half of multiracial targets as monoracial, 2) multiracial targets who identified themselves as black were nearly always perceived as black but not always as multiracial, and 3) the demographic and environmental characteristics of observers had no bearing on the congruence of their racial perceptions. That is, regardless of their own demographic characteristics or exposure to people of other races, observers were more congruent when examining targets who self-identified as black or white and less congruent when identifying targets from Asian, Hispanic, American Indian, or Middle Eastern backgrounds. Despite the demographic trend toward multiracialism in the United States, observers’ perceptions may maintain the status quo in race relations: a black-white dichotomy where part-blacks remain in the collective black category.

Abstract = {There is a substantial literature documenting pre-schoolers’ racial awareness and affect from multiracial societies in North America and a fast-growing body of work from societies that are or were once more racially homogeneous. However, studies in Britain, a racially diverse society, on this developmental period have been curiously rare. This study examined racial awareness and affect of 125 White, Black, and Asian 3-—to 5-year-olds in London. Children were tested on cognitive level, person description and classification, race labelling and matching, self-categorization and asked about their racial preference and rejection and inferences about their mothers’ preference and rejection. Children were least likely to use race versus other categorical cues to spontaneously describe or classify others, even though the majority correctly sorted others by race labels, matched them to drawings, and categorized themselves by race. With age and increasing cognitive level, children described and categorized others by race more and improved in race matching. White children from age 4 preferred White peers and inferred that their mothers would prefer White children at age 5. Children’s own preference and inference about mothers are related. Children did not show race-based rejection, but boys inferred that their mothers would prefer White children and reject Black children. The findings are discussed in relation to racial salience between contexts, previous research, and theories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The present study reports on correlational data gathered from an Internet survey to explore why forced-choice dilemma situations relate to depressive symptoms among multiracial people (N = 317). Specifically, a model was tested that explored the role of identity autonomy (the extent to which multiracial people feel they can racially identify however they desire) and public regard (the extent to which multiracial people think others value their multiracial identity). The results of the model suggest that forced-choice dilemmas predict greater depressive symptoms because forced-choice dilemmas may promote greater beliefs that their multiracial identity is devalued in society and more generally restrict identity autonomy.

Abstract = {For multiracial adolescents, forming a sense of self and identity can be complicated, even at the level of classifying themselves in terms of racial group membership. Using a Race Self Complexity (Winston et al., 2004) theoretical framework, this study used an open-ended question to examine the racial self-identification fluidity of 66 adolescents during the 7th, 8th, and 11th grades. This sample included 22 Black/White multiracial adolescents, as well as a matched sample of 22 Black and 22 White adolescents. Seventy-three percent of the multiracial adolescents changed their racial self-identification in the form of two time change patterns with a number of consolidating and differentiating racial self-identification variations. There was no change for the monoracial adolescents. These results suggest that within the lives of multiracial adolescents, the process of racial self-identification may be a personality characteristic adaptation to the meaning of race in American society that may change across time, place, and role.

In the original article, estimates from the 2006 Census included in the first paragraph of the Background section on p. 260 are incorrect. The sentence: ‘More recent estimates from the 2006 Census indicate that approximately one-quarter of the populations of Alabama, California, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina and an estimated one-third of the populations of Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and South Carolina identify as multiracial (Stuckey 2008)’ should be disregarded. The online article and map (Stuckey 2008) that we cite once indicated that one-quarter of California identifies as multiracial, but now specifies the number as at around 2%. Similarly, according to the updated article, the multiracial population of the USA seems to have fallen from 2.5% of the total population to 1.6%.] Despite the increasing interest in the experiences of multiracial individuals, as evidenced by the emergent body of literature and research related to multiracial experiences, we lack an understanding of methodological concerns related to research with multiracial individuals. Here, we seek to (1) investigate the applicability of theories of insider/outsider status to research conducted by and with multiracial individuals, (2) interrogate our own research experiences as multiracial scholars conducting research with multiracial students, and (3) identify implications from our analysis for other researchers. We conclude that understandings of methodological terms related to monoracial populations are limited in their applicability to research with multiracial individuals. Additionally, we conclude that navigating multiracial identities in research situations is a particularly complicated process aided less by a shared sense of identity or community between researcher and participants and more by experiences that stem from a similar need to engage in micronegotiations of racial and ethnic identities.

Conceptualizing race as an ascribed extended kinship network and using notions of "groundedness" from bicultural identity literature, the relational aspects of participants’ identity development are highlighted.

Participants included White, Black, and Bi/Multiracial college students. Findings highlighted sex and racial differences based on binge eating and weight status. Notably, Bi/Multiracial women who endorsed binge eating behavior and who were overweight reported greater levels of anxiety than all other groups and greater levels of depression than White women and White men. Additionally, Bi/Multiracial women and White women who endorsed binge eating behavior and who were overweight reported greater body image dissatisfaction relative to Black women and White men.

Part 2 of Globalization and America: Race, Human Rights, and Inequality analyzes reparations movements in light of historical and ongoing forms of structural, gendered racism in the United States against women and men of color. Part 3’s chapters investigate immigrants’ rights in relation to human rights discourses; access to social capital; the gendered, racial, and sexual violence of globalization; and the "petit apartheid" under which many U.S. immigrant communities live. Part 4 concludes the collection with essays on the intersections between global and local human rights issues.

In contrast to current understandings of identity-based movements, this article argues that the Hapa movement seeks simultaneously to deconstruct traditional notions of (mono)racial identities and to secure recognition for a multiracial “Hapa” identity. Movements that have identity as a goal are motivated by activists’ understandings of how categories are constituted and how those categories, codes, and ways of thinking serve as axes of regulation and domination. The Hapa movement simultaneously challenges (mono)racial categories at both the institutional level through targeting the state and at the micro level through challenging the quotidian enactment of race and promulgating a Hapa identity. Activism by mixed-race individuals and organizations constitutes an important challenge to power that has significant implications for racial categorization and classification in contemporary American society.

Abstract = {Using a social work developmental lens, this qualitative study explored some of the numerous social and environmental factors that shape a multiracial individual’s cultural identity. Results from transcript analysis portray the cultural identity of multiracial persons as significantly influenced by (1) personal experiences of racism and discrimination; (2) social interactions and relationships with peers and family; and (3) the racial climate of the school and community. The findings from this study support more fluid, ecological models of multiracial identity development that are more effective at explicating some of the highly complex and influential contextual factors that impact a multiracial person’s cultural identity development.

Abstract = {How does education affect racial attitudes? Past studies focus almost exclusively on whites’ attitudes toward blacks, neglecting important minority populations. This study extends previous research by analyzing the effects of education on beliefs about racial stereotypes, discrimination, and affirmative action policies among whites, Asians, Hispanics, and blacks. Results indicate that whites, Hispanics, and blacks with higher levels of education are more likely to reject negative stereotypes, but these effects are less consistent among Asians. And, although education has consistent positive effects on awareness of discrimination against minorities, a more advanced education is not associated with greater support for racial preferences among any respondent group. Education is, however, related to more favorable attitudes toward race-targeted job training. These results are partly consistent with a revised group conflict perspective positing that education unevenly promotes different elements of the dominant racial ideology among nonwhite minorities, depending on their position in the racial hierarchy.

Abstract = {This article examines how multiracial individuals negotiate their different and sometimes conflicting racial identities. Drawing from previous work on bicultural identity integration (see Benet-Martínez & Haritatos, 2005), we proposed a new construct, multiracial identity integration (MII), to measure individual differences in perceptions of compatibility between multiple racial identities. We found that MII is composed of two independent subscales: racial distance that describes whether different racial identities are perceived as disparate, and racial conflict that describes whether different racial identities are perceived as in conflict. We also found that recalling positive multiracial experiences increased MII, while recalling negative multiracial experiences decreased MII. These findings have implications for understanding the psychological well-being of multiracial individuals, and the development of social policy and programs catered to this population.

Abstract = {Although multiple race responses are now allowed on federal censuses and surveys, most interracially married single-race parents report a single race for their children. It is well-established that the social context of these racial identification decisions affects their outcome. This research focuses instead on the physical context. It is argued that homelands—physical places with cultural meaning—are an important component of the intergenerational transfer of a single-race identity in indigenous mixed-race families. To test potential explanations for the relationship between homelands and indigenous identities, this research focuses on families in which an interracially-married American Indian lives with a spouse and child and was included in the Census 2000 5% Public Use Microdata Sample. Logistic regression reveals a strong effect of living in an American Indian homeland on the child’s chances of being reported as single-race American Indian. This effect remains even after accounting for strong ties to American Indians and other groups, family and area poverty levels, geographic isolation, and the racial composition of the area. The intergenerational transmission of strong identities continues in this multiracial era (as it has for centuries) in the context of culturally meaningful physical places.

Abstract = {We use incidence data from the 1980 Census and 2008 American Community Survey to track recent trends in interracial marriage. Intermarriage with Whites increased rapidly among Blacks but stalled among Asians and American Indians. Black–White intermarriage increased threefold over 1980–2008, independent of changing socioeconomic status, suggesting declining social distance between Blacks and Whites. Marriages between the U.S.‐ and foreign‐born populations also grew rapidly. Marriages to immigrants increased fivefold among U.S.‐born Asian women and doubled among U.S.‐born Latinas since 1980. Out‐marriage to Whites also was higher among self‐identified biracial than monoracial individuals, but these differences were smallest among Blacks. Interracial couples were overrepresented among cohabiting couples. Finally, log‐linear models provide evidence of growing racial exogamy, but only after adjusting for changing demographic opportunities for intermarriage. Marriages between U.S.‐ and foreign‐born coethnics have been driven by new immigration while slowing the upward trajectory of interracial marriage in America.

Are the outcomes of multiracial individuals explained by the Latin Americanization hypothesis (Bonilla-Silva 2002), or a hardening racial divide between blacks and all other racial groups (Gans 1999; Yancey 2006)? Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I address these questions and show that the educational outcomes of multiracial groups and individuals are not consistently explained by measures of appearance, as suggested by these theories. Although the educational outcomes of Latinos and single-race groups are significantly associated with skin color and the racial perceptions of observers, multiracial young adults' high school and college educational outcomes are not consistently related to either measure of appearance. Parental education and family income are the most important predictors of educational outcomes for multiracial respondents across different types of outcomes.

Abstract = {Introduction: Singapore has one of the world’s highest rates of diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is also associated with depression, the nature of this relation is possibly bidirectional and complex and there are a number of putative associated factors. Aims: To establish the prevalence of depressive symptoms in an Asian multiracial population with diabetes and identify some of these putative risk factors including ethnicity for depressive symptoms while controlling for multiple confounding variables. Methods: This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study in an Asian multiracial population with DM. The subjects were 537 outpatients (aged 21 years and above) attending a specialist diabetes treatment centre in a general hospital. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) with a cut-off score of 16 or more indicating the presence of depressive symptoms. Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 31.1%. Following a logistic regression with depression as the dependent variable, Indian race, type of treatment, activity level and marital status (divorced/separated) were significantly associated with a high risk of depression. Conclusions: This is the first study done among 3 ethnic groups Chinese, Malays and Indians within the same geographical location, and the findings show that depressive symptoms are common among diabetic patients and highest among those of Indian ethnicity.

Abstract = {We investigate the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents through a comparison of the size and composition of the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents with single race adolescents. We consider three hypotheses suggested by the literature on multiraciality and interracial friendships: (1) that multiracial adolescents have smaller friendship networks than single-race adolescents because they are more often rejected by their single race peers, (2) that multiracial adolescents form more racially diverse friendship networks than single-race adolescents, and (3) that multiracial adolescents are especially likely to bridge (or socially connect) friendships among members of their single-race heritage background groups. Using data on adolescent friendship networks from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we find that multiracial adolescents are as popular as non-white adolescents and have social networks that are as racially diverse as the single-race groups with the most diverse friendship networks. Biracial adolescents with black ancestry have an especially high rate of friendship bridging between black persons and persons of other races, relative to black or white adolescents.

With its implied shifting meaning of race, newspapers portrayed the reaction to this change as a firestorm of debate along racial fault lines, highlighted by Black-American inferences that this was a perilous decision. Using textual analysis, I examine from 1996 to 2006 how five Black-American and three White-American newspapers characterized multiracial people. White-American papers framed the discussion in two ways: (a) multiracial people epitomize a new era in which race has lost its bite, and (b) Black America stands in the way of their gaining their civil rights. There were also two frames for the Black-American papers: (a) The lobby advocates individual identity and is undergirded by denial or distancing from Blackness, and (b) that focus undermines Black America’s future by playing into the misguided notion that race is socially insignificant.

Abstract = {Monoracial and multiracial individuals are likely to have different conceptualizations of race and subsequently different approaches toward racial ambiguity. In particular, monoracial individuals may be more likely to rely on categories when processing ambiguous faces, whereas multiracial individuals may tend to ignore such categorizations due to a reduced tendency to essentialize race. We compared monoracial (White and Asian) and biracial (Asian/White) individuals’ memory patterns. Specifically, we examined participants’ memory for White, Asian, and biracial faces labelled as either White or Asian. Both White and Asian participants relied on the labels, remembering faces labeled as the in-group better than faces labeled as the out-group. Biracial participants relied less on the labels, exhibiting better recognition memory overall. Biracial participants’ memory performance was also highly correlated with a less essentialist view of human traits. This cognitive flexibility may serve an adaptive function for biracial individuals and contribute to enhanced facial recognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Using confidential 1990 Census micro-data, we investigate the choices parents made for the three most common racially mixed household types (Asian-white, black-white and Latino-white) in twelve large metropolitan areas. We find that context affects the reporting of children's racial identity. We examine these effects with models that incorporate three spatial scales: households, neighborhoods and metropolitan areas. Model estimates reveal that racial claims made by parents of Latino- and Asian-white (but not black-white) children varied significantly across metropolitan area. A neighborhood's proportion white increased the probability that parents reported their children as white, while a neighborhood's racial diversity increased the probability that black-white parents claimed a non-white race (black or 'other') for their children.

Abstract = {There are increasing numbers of multiracial families created through marriage, adoption, birth, and a growing population of multiracial persons. Multiracials are a hidden but dominant group of transracially adopted children in both the United Kingdom and the United States. This paper introduces findings from an interpretive study of 25 transracially adopted multiracials regarding a set of experiences participants called "being raised by White people." Three aspects of this experience are explored: (1) the centrality yet absence of racial resemblance, (2) navigating discordant parent-child racial experiences, and (3) managing societal perceptions of transracial adoption. Whereas research suggests some parents believe race is less salient for multiracial children than for Black children, this study finds participants experienced highly racialized worlds into adulthood.

Abstract = {The study presented here tested three theories of racial differences in academic performance among monoracial and multiracial high school students. These theories (status attainment, oppositional culture, and educational attitudes) were developed to explain differences in achievement among monoracial groups, but the study tested how the theories apply to a multiracial sample. The results show that ethnic identity and experiences of ethnic discrimination are not strong factors in explaining academic performance among multiracial or monoracial students. Instead, the grades of multiracial students are related to their concrete beliefs about the consequences of school failure, the educational values of their peers, and the racial composition of their neighborhoods and schools. Additional descriptive statistics found that multiracial students who self-identify as black or Hispanic achieve lower grades than do those who self-identify as white or Asian. The author suggests a transracial theory of academic performance that considers the effects of contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

After briefly reviewing a bit of history, we focus particularly on the racial and ethnic identities of multiracial Asian Americans. Racial and ethnic identities are the area most researched in this population: The question "What are you?" challenges one's identification and asks multiracial Asian Americans to place themselves racially within relation to racial categories in the United States. This is not always an easy thing to do, as the identities of multiracial Asian Americans are affected by many different influences within the families, social groups and communities, and individuals. This chapter also explores mental health strengths and challenges in multiracial Asian Americans,and connections between mental health and identities.

Abstract = {Race is a socially constructed way of grouping people, which differs among societies and over time. It has no biological basis. In the United States, many individuals have experienced misrepresentation because of restrictive racial labels. Multiracial is an inclusive identification term that "refers to people who are of two or more racial heritages" and refers "to people across all racial mixes". The multiracial movement, which gained momentum in the late 1970's and early 1980's, has been proactively addressing the unique issues of the mixed race population in the United States. The multiracial movement is being pursued by people dedicated to the advancement of the rights and self-expression of multiracial individuals and families. Our chapter aims to advance the multiracial movement by bridging the language barrier that is present both within the mixed-race community and between multiracial and monoracial persons. We propose that this language barrier is the lack of a vernacular that is sufficiently reflective of the identities and existence of people of mixed heritage. The voice and authentic experiences of racially mixed people within the United States have been suppressed and silenced by a lack of inclusive terminology. Current racial conceptualizations emphasize an either/or approach that can unnecessarily dichotomize identity for people of racially mixed heritage. There is a need for people to openly consider the multiple possibilities of mixed race individuals' heritages. The language barrier in the United States can be overcome if society as a whole is willing to adopt a multiracial-affirmative language and mindset. In this chapter, we advocate suggestions for how all individuals—both multiracial and monoracial persons—can use various mixed race identity terminology, see the world through a multiracial-affirmative lens, and implement multiracial-affirmative actions.

Abstract = {As more biracial and multiracial students enter the classroom, educators have begun to critically examine the concept of race. Through compelling student and teacher narratives, best-selling author Bonnie M. Davis gives voice to a frequently mislabeled and misunderstood segment of the population. Filled with research-based instructional strategies and reflective questions, the book supports readers in examining: The meaning of race, difference, and ethnicity; How mixed-identity students develop racial identities; How to adjust instruction to demonstrate cultural proficiency; and Complex questions to help deepen understanding of bi- and multiracial experiences, white privilege, and the history of race in the U.S. This sensitively written yet practical guide fills a gap in the professional literature by examining the experiences of biracial and multiracial students in the context of today's classrooms. The author calls upon readers to take a transformational journey toward racial literacy and ultimately become empowered by a real understanding of what it means to be biracial or multiracial and enable all students to experience increased self-confidence and believe in their ability to succeed.

Few studies focus on determining whether usual source of care mediates the association between health insurance and diabetes among men. Methods: Using data from the 2005 California Health Interview Survey, responses from 17,472 men were analyzed to examine the extent to which a usual source of health care mediates the relationship between health insurance and diabetes. Results: Sobel–Goodman tests for mediation indicated the largest effects between Latino and White men. For African American and Asian men, usual source of care did not serve as a significant mediation factor between health insurance and diabetes.

The sample consisted of 923 9th- to 12th-grade students from Black, Latino, Asian, and multiracial backgrounds.

Abstract = {In this chapter I cover both the determinants of racial identification among multiracial youth and its implications for their mental health, achievement, and self-esteem. The goals for this chapter are, first, to describe the literature on identity development among biracials as a way of challenging the notion of race as a single and fixed aspect of identity. This first goal leads logically to the second goal, which is to examine the developmental implications of flexible racial identity. Understanding these implications for multiracial youth may even shed some light on the racial identity development of monoracial youth. In keeping with my two goals, I organize the literature into two sections: one on identity development, and the other on the impact of identity on child and adolescent outcomes. Within the section on identity development, I include three subsections. The first describes general theories of multiracial identity development, the second provides details about specific race combinations (part-Black, part-Asian, part-Hispanic, part-American Indian), and the third explores the connections between context and racial identification. In the section on the impact of identity on developmental outcomes, I discuss the distinction between ancestry and racial identity for multiracial youth and explore the ways that context mediates the identification- development link among multiracial youth.

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this research is to obtain accurate drinking norms for students living in the university residences in preparation for future social norms interventions that would allow individual students to compare their drinking to an appropriate reference group. Method: Random cluster sampling was used to obtain data from 318 residence students who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a brief, reliable and valid screening measure designed by the World Health Organisation (Babor et al. 2001). Results: The Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.83 reported for this multicultural sample is high, suggesting that the AUDIT may be reliably used in this and similar contexts. Normative scores are reported in the form of percentiles. Comparisons between the portions of students drinking safely and hazardously according to race and gender indicate that while male students are drinking no more hazardously than female students, white students drink far more hazardously than black students. Conclusions: These differences suggest that both race - and gender-specific norms would be essential for an effective social norms intervention in this multicultural South African context. Finally, the racialised drinking patterns might reflect an informal segregation of social space at Rhodes University. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background/Context: One of the most critical functions of a well-integrated school is the development of “culturally flexible” students who, over the course of their social development, effectively navigate diverse social environs such as the workplace, communities, and neighborhoods. Most studies, albeit with some exceptions, have investigated the impact of desegregation on short- and long-term gains in achievement and attainment, as opposed to its impact on intergroup relations. Mixed-race schools are vital not only for bolstering achievement outcomes of previously disadvantaged students but also for promoting social cohesion in a diverse society. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Specifically, this article examines the difference in cultural flexibility between black and white students enrolled in schools with different racial and ethnic compositions. Cultural flexibility is defined as the propensity to value and move across different cultural and social peer groups and environments. Furthermore, this article provides some insight into how students in different mixed-race and desegregated educational contexts experience their school’s social organization and cultural environments, which influence their interactions and academic behaviors. Setting: The study was conducted over a 6-month period in four high schools: a majority-minority school and a majority-white school located in a northeastern city, and a majority-minority school and a majority-white school located in a southern city. Research Design: Survey data were gathered from a randomly stratified sample of 471 Black and White students attending. In addition, ethnographic notes from weeks of school observations and transcribed interview data from 57 group interviews conducted in the four schools with students in Grades 9–12 complemented the survey research. Data Collection and Analysis: Findings reveal significant associations among self-esteem, academic and extracurricular placement, and cultural flexibility for black students. Also, black students in majority-minority schools scored significantly higher on the cultural flexibility scale than those in majority-white schools. Among white students, regional location and academic placement showed statistically significant associations with cultural flexibility. The ethnographic and interview data further explicate why these patterns occurred and illuminate how certain school contextual factors are likely linked to students’ cultural flexibility. Overall, this study’s findings highlight some connections between student and school behaviors as they pertain to both students’ and educators’ willingness and ability to realize the visions of racial and ethnic integration wholly.

I do this through a comparison of two potentially mixed-race identities, the afro-indigenous Garifuna of Honduras and peoples of East Indian and African mixture (douglas) in Trinidad. Through this comparison I show that in both Honduras and Trinidad classification of mixed-race peoples can follow the logic of the racial binary or of the racial continuum depending on the historical context and the particular mix. I also discuss the way that mixed-race identities can sometimes be radical critiques of state racial projects of pluralism and at other times they can be the basis of state racial projects meant to obfuscate racial pluralism.

Abstract = {We explore the possibility that racially inclusive churches are also more inclusive in SES and supportive of gender equality. We used the Lilly Survey of Congregations to compare SES diversity and attitudes toward female leadership between multiracial and nonmultiracial churches. Findings indicate that multiracial churches promote SES diversity, but not necessarily gender equality. The relationship is straightforward as it concerns SES diversity, as multiracial churches are more likely to exhibit SES diversity than nonmultiracial churches. However, we found that a good deal of the propensity of multiracial churches to support gender equality is tied to the size of cities in which they are located. Further, theology acts as a suppressor variable in that conservative multiracial churches are less supportive of gender equality than other conservative churches, while progressive multiracial churches are more supportive of gender equality than other progressive churches.

Abstract = {Assumptions of racial essentialism lead to inadequate analysis of multiracial churches. Instead, acknowledging ethnic identity as a negotiated phenomenon encourages a richer investigation of how congregational participation stimulates and redefines a person's racial and ethnic identity. The malleability of ethnic identity is such that it is often obscured in favor of other aspects of self. Ethnographic analysis of two multiracial churches, Mosaic and Oasis, indicates that particularistic ethnic affiliations recede when otherworldly, value-rational interests are emphasized. Ethnic transcendence occurs when members adopt a shared identity based on a uniquely congregational understanding of what it means to be a properly religious person (a proper "Christian," "Jew," "Muslim," "Buddhist," etc.). In short, the distinctive accomplishment of multiracial congregations is the cultivation of an inclusive religious identity that overrides divisive aspects of ethnic identity. Moreover, recognizing the varying salience of racial and ethnic identity evokes greater caution regarding what can be assumed when researchers apply the label "multiracial" to congregations.

About 6.8 million Americans did so, and a disproportionate percentage of them were children under age 18 years old.

Twelve books were examined to determine whether they covered multiracial and multiethnic children. Results of this study showed that only two of these books addressed issues related to the healthy development of multiracial/multiethnic children in any detail; and, while several used terms such as biracial and bicultural, these terms were always used to describe single-race minority children living in a majority context.

Abstract = {Reviews the book Making multiracials: State, family, and market in the redrawing of the color line by Kimberly McClain DaCosta (2007). Based on multiple methods, the book paints a multiracial mosaic from in-depth interviews with 62 participants in groups formed for intermarried couples, their families, and multiracial adults, in addition to fieldwork conducted at related events such as mixed-race conferences, college campuses, and public hearings on census classification. The book is divided into seven chapters on various realms including families, communities, and the market, woven together by connected threads on how multiracials have been constructed—socially, culturally, and politically. In the end, Making Multiracials provides a compelling and convincing analysis of not only multiracialism, but the larger racial politics. The strength of the work lies in DaCosta’s multilayered critique of the ways in which multiracialism is constructed. By blending theory, empirical examination, and strong analysis, Making Multiracials offers a nuanced context for understanding the roles that individuals, communities, and policies play in perpetuating and potentially combating racial inequality.

Participants (N=252) evaluated resume/photograph pairs, each containing a Caucasian and a Black applicant, with minority applicants representing three levels of racial prototypicality. The number of jobs awarded to minorities increased as Black racial prototypicality increased. Each level of AA policy strength increased the number of minority hires, but these increases came with a price: AA directives decreased the percentage of minority hires attributed to higher qualifications and increased perceptions that hires were due to AA more than was actually the case.

Native American-whites appear to have the least stable identification.

Abstract = {Objective: There have been few studies of quality of life (QOL) among older persons with schizophrenia. The authors used an adaptation of Lehman's QOL model to examine factors that impact QOL in a multiracial urban sample of older persons with schizophrenia. Methods: The schizophrenia group consisted of 198 community-dwelling persons aged 55 years and older who developed schizophrenia before age 45 years. A community comparison group (N = 113) was recruited using randomly selected block-groups. The QOL model consisted of four variable sets (demographic, objective, clinical, and subjective) comprising 19 independent variables. The dependent variable was the Quality of Life Index (QLI). Results: We schizophrenia group had a significantly lower QLI score than the comparison group (21.7 versus 24.2; t = -536, df = 362, p = 0.001). Within the schizophrenia group, in bivariate analyses, 11 of 19 variables were significantly related to QLI. In regression analysis, six variables were significantly associated with the QLI: fewer depressive symptoms, more cognitive deficits, fewer acute life stressors, fewer medication side effects, lower financial strain, and better self-rated health. The model explained 55% of the variance in QLI, with the demographic, objective, psychiatric illness, and subjective variable sets accounting for 6%, 35%, 9%, and 5% of the variance, respectively. With the exception of the demographic set, each of the variable sets added significant variance. Conclusion: Our data confirmed earlier reports that older persons with schizophrenia have lower self-reported quality of life than their age-matched peers. Our findings suggest that the factors impacting on QOL are potentially ameliorable and therefore provide an opportunity to enhance the well-being of this population.

Abstract = {In a country whose cultural orientation is built around sharp divisions marked by the polar opposite colors black and white, people who combine these two groups have struggled to assert their identities. Black and white people are pitted against one another, portrayed as being in opposition visually and culturally. While the group generally called biracial is a complex territory to explore both psychologically and culturally, there are also long-standing groups, referred to historically as triracial isolates, whose heritage blends the two groups with the addition of various Native American nations. This chapter explores the historic and contemporary issues involved with triracial and biracial American ancestry. It will also examine such occurrences abroad, pointing to the "Stolen Generation" of Australia and the noble families of Europe. Finally, this chapter will assist readers in their search for ancestry. Woven throughout are the psychological issues raised by the assertion of biracial or triracial identity, as opposed to homogenous cultural identification as black, white, or Native American. The prejudice from dominant racial groups because of homogenous identifications is discussed along with suggestions for healing and moving forward while keeping multiracial identity intact.

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined whether perceived chronic discrimination was related to excess body fat accumulation in a random, multiethnic, population-based sample of US adults. Methods: We used multivariate multinomial logistic regression and logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between interpersonal experiences of perceived chronic discrimination and body mass index and high-risk waist circumference. Results: Consistent with other studies, our analyses showed that perceived unfair treatment was associated with increased abdominal obesity. Compared with Irish, Jewish, Polish, and Italian Whites who did not experience perceived chronic discrimination, Irish, Jewish, Polish, and Italian Whites who perceived chronic discrimination were 2 to 6 times more likely to have a high-risk waist circumference. No significant relationship between perceived discrimination and the obesity measures was found among the other Whites, Blacks, or Hispanics. Conclusions: These findings are not completely unsupported. White ethnic groups including Polish, Italians, Jews, and Irish have historically been discriminated against in the United States, and other recent research suggests that they experience higher levels of perceived discrimination than do other Whites and that these experiences adversely affect their health.

Abstract = {Objective: This study examines the conditions under which minorities will face policy inequity within the educational system. It turns to the theory of representative bureaucracy as one possible explanation, and extends the literature by considering whether African-American students benefit from the presence of Latinos on teaching faculties and vice versa. This study also tests competing theories of how racial context influences minority educational policy outcomes. Methods: This study combines original survey data with data gathered by the U.S. Census to predict levels of academic grouping in U.S. school districts as reported by the Office of Civil Rights. Results: Minority teachers lower levels of discrimination among all minority students, not just co-ethnics. Moreover, minority teachers do so consistently and with a substantive impact that occasionally rivals that of co-ethnic teachers. The findings also suggest that greater levels of racial/ethnic diversity within a district are associated with lower levels of discrimination. Conclusion: Theories of race relations must move beyond black-Anglo or Latino-Anglo relations to consider how multiple racial/ethnic groups interact, and how such interactions affect the lives of minority groups differently.

Abstract = {To better understand the diversity of the multiracial population, compare multiracial data to single-race data, and evaluate the rigidity of racial boundaries, we must understand the single-race identification choices of multiracial respondents. Many studies assume that this pattern will be straightforward for multiracial respondents who choose a part-black identification, with virtually all choosing a "black" single-race identification. I investigate whether this assumption is justified by available survey data. Using the May 1995 Current Population Survey's Race and Ethnicity Supplement, I explore the single-race identifications of individuals who have chosen a part-black multiracial label on a survey. I find that single-race identification choices on forced-choice questions vary considerably across family heritage groups, with those who choose a "black-American Indian" identity extremely likely to select a black single-race identity, while other groups like "black-whites" have substantial variation in single-race identifications. Identification patterns vary significantly by age, family context and survey characteristics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on the intersections between social invalidation and two aspects of the self: self-identification as a bisexual and as one of African descent, particularly in addressing these issues therapeutically toward the promotion of well-being. I move beyond situating bisexuality solely within love relationships. Rather, my focus is twofold. First, attention is directed to the complexity of multiracial bisexuals of African descent's identities and their relationships to each other and to heteronormative-hegemonic structures. Second, attention is directed to the therapeutic aspects of assisting these clients to achieve a sense of self and well-being by reauthoring the dominant narratives of their lives.  The content addresses the following themes to assist therapists working with this population. 1. Discussion of the sociocultural and political dimensions that shape identity development for multiracial bisexuals of African descent; 2. Their experience of invalidation, marginality, and oppression related to heterosexist and patriarchal gender and sexual ideologies that are often prevalent in African American communities; and 3. An exploration of the benefits to amassing sufficient social capital toward the promotion of mental health and well-being in their lives. 4.

Abstract = {This chapter discusses multiracial college students, defined as students whose biological parents are of two or more different racial backgrounds or heritages (Root, 1992). The repeal of laws in the United States that opposed mixed-race coupling or marriages, brought about by the Loving et ux. v. Virginia (1967) Supreme Court decision, has resulted in a dramatic increase in interracial unions. Subsequently, there has also been a dramatic increase in the births of persons of mixed-race heritage. For the first time in its history, the 2000 Census provided persons of mixed-race heritages and backgrounds with the opportunity to describe how they identify racially by selecting more than one racial category (Root & Kelley, 2003). According to data from the 2000 Census, 6.8 million people were identified as being of more than one racial category, or multiracial (Jones & Smith, 2001). The multiracial population is young. Jones and Smith (2003) indicated that approximately 42% of the population is under 18 years of age and close to 70% is under 35 years of age. At the time of the 2000 Census, only 5.4% of the multiracial population was between the ages of 18 and 20; however, a dramatic increase is expected in the near future. Although all children do not aspire to attend college, these figures suggest that the number of multiracial individuals who will be attending college could also show a dramatic increase (Paladino, 2004).

This study aims to determine the prevalence of symptomatic remission in older adults with schizophrenia. Methods: The Schizophrenia Group consisted of 198 persons aged 55+ years living in the community who developed schizophrenia before age 45 years. Our definition of remission was adapted from the criteria of the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group. To attain remission, persons had to have scores of <3 on eight domains of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale and no hospitalizations within the previous year. Using George's Social Antecedent Model, we examined the association of remission with 18 predictor variables. Results: Forty-nine percent of the sample met the criteria for symptomatic remission. In logistic regression analysis, four variables—fewer total network contacts, greater proportion of intimates, fewer lifetime traumatic events, and higher Dementia Rating Scale scores—were significantly associated with remission. Conclusions: Remission rates were consistent with those reported in younger samples.

There was also a significant relationship between Japanese American identity and multiracial appearance and social variables.

Abstract = {This chapter examines the counseling issues and concerns of multiracial individuals and families. In exploring this population, it is important to first identify and define who is included. Multiracial individuals are defined as persons whose biological parents are of two or more different racial backgrounds and whose lineage encompasses two or more distinctly different racial backgrounds (Funderburg, 1994; Gibbs, 1989; Root, 1992). Interracial couples are described as couples, married or not, in which each partner is of a different racial background (Root, 1992; Spickard, 1989). Multiracial families are composed of interracial couples and their multiracial offspring; single parents with biological offspring who are multiracial and single parents who have gone through a surrogate pregnancy process or artificial insemination process that results in the birth of a multiracial child; and families in which a cross-racial or transracial adoption has occurred, including gay and lesbian couples or single individuals who have adopted transracially or have gone through a surrogate pregnancy process or artificial insemination process that results in the birth of a multiracial child (Kenney, 2000). Cross-racial or transracial adoptions are adoptions in which children are placed with families of another race (Stolley, 1993). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Keeping with the format traditionally used in the American Psychological Association (APA) videotape series, the video is essentially divided into three sections. The didactic portions of the video are conducted through dialogue between Root and her host, Jon Carlson. Root begins by explaining the necessity for a clinical framework for clients with mixed-race identities, and she explains the conceptual framework she developed to meet the unique needs of this client group. Root then carries out a practice session with a client, which is followed by commentary on various portions of the session that provide context for important considerations when working with clients from this population.

Abstract = {It is sometimes said that the most segregated time of the week in the United States is Sunday morning. Even as workplaces and public institutions such as the military have become racially integrated, racial separation in Christian religious congregations is the norm. And yet some congregations remain stubbornly, racially mixed. People of the Dream is the most complete study of this phenomenon ever undertaken. Author Michael Emerson explores such questions as: how do racially mixed congregations come together? How are they sustained? Who attends them, how did they get there, and what are their experiences? Engagingly written, the book enters the worlds of these congregations through national surveys and in-depth studies of those attending racially mixed churches. Data for the book was collected over seven years by the author and his research team. It includes more than 2,500 telephone interviews, hundreds of written surveys, and extensive visits to mixed-race congregations throughout the United States. People of the Dream argues that multiracial congregations are bridge organizations that gather and facilitate cross-racial friendships, disproportionately housing people who have substantially more racially diverse social networks than do other Americans. The book concludes that multiracial congregations and the people in them may be harbingers of racial change to come in the United States. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: Few multiracial epidemiological community-based studies of anxiety have been conducted with older adults. This study examined the prevalence of subsyndromal and syndromal anxiety and associated factors among older persons living in an urban area. Methods: Persons aged 55 years and over (214 Caucasian and 860 black) living in Brooklyn, New York, between 1996 and 1999 were interviewed in randomly selected block groups. The researchers used an adaptation of George's social antecedent model to examine the association of 18 variables with anxiety. Syndromal anxiety was defined as a score of 50 or higher on the Anxiety Status Inventory Scale (ASIS). Subsyndromal anxiety was defined as an ASIS score under 50 and a positive response on three or more ASIS items, including at least one worry item. The sample was weighted by race and gender on the basis of 1990 census totals. Results: The prevalence of syndromal and subsyndromal anxiety was 2.3 and 13.3 percent, respectively. With binary logistic regression analysis, persons rated as having syndromal anxiety differed from nonanxious individuals on ten of the 18 variables and persons with subsyndromal anxiety differed on seven. The anxiety groups differed from each other on three variables. In the past year, 23 and 12 percent of persons with syndromal and subsyndromal anxiety, respectively, reported seeking mental health assistance. Conclusions: About 14 percent of older adults have anxiety, and much of it is untreated. Anxious and nonanxious individuals have substantial differences in psychosocial and health-related variables. Older adults who have subsyndromal anxiety can be viewed as distinct from nonanxious older individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Drawing from multiracial feminist theorizing, the author asks, Is self-identification as feminist a biased indicator of the salience of feminism in African American women's lives? Do women's racial statuses mediate the relationship between particular life events and experiences and the extent to which they embrace feminism? and To what extent are racial differences important when considering what women understand feminism to be? To answer these questions, the author conducted multiple group analyses of structural equation models to analyze data from the 1996 General Social Survey. Her findings are consistent with multiracial feminist theories and suggest a need to rethink traditional approaches to feminist research so that women's differences are no longer marginalized.

Venzant Chambers (International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, 2010[Jun], Vol 23[3], 259-281). In the original article, estimates from the 2006 Census included in the first paragraph of the Background section on p. 260 are incorrect. The sentence: ‘More recent estimates from the 2006 Census indicate that approximately one-quarter of the populations of Alabama, California, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina and an estimated one-third of the populations of Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and South Carolina identify as multiracial (Stuckey 2008)’ should be disregarded. The online article and map (Stuckey 2008) that we cite once indicated that one-quarter of California identifies as multiracial, but now specifies the number as at around 2%. Similarly, according to the updated article, the multiracial population of the USA seems to have fallen from 2.5% of the total population to 1.6%. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2010-08153-002[/rid]). Despite the increasing interest in the experiences of multiracial individuals, as evidenced by the emergent body of literature and research related to multiracial experiences, we lack an understanding of methodological concerns related to research with multiracial individuals. Here, we seek to (1) investigate the applicability of theories of insider/outsider status to research conducted by and with multiracial individuals, (2) interrogate our own research experiences as multiracial scholars conducting research with multiracial students, and (3) identify implications from our analysis for other researchers. We conclude that understandings of methodological terms related to monoracial populations are limited in their applicability to research with multiracial individuals. Additionally, we conclude that navigating multiracial identities in research situations is a particularly complicated process aided less by a shared sense of identity or community between researcher and participants and more by experiences that stem from a similar need to engage in micronegotiations of racial and ethnic identities.

Abstract = {The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and the Padua Inventory Washington State University Revision are commonly used measures of obsessive-compulsive disorder. They have been shown to be reliable and valid with both clinical and nonclinical samples. However, their psychometrics have primarily been assessed using homogenous white samples. This is a concern because while some studies of anxiety measures among multiple racial and ethnic groups suggest equivalence (e.g., Norton, J Anxiety Dis. 2005;19:699-707), others report significant racial/ethnic differences and unequal predictive validity (e.g., Thomas et al., Assessment. 2000;7:247-258). This study examined 2 measures of obsessive-compulsive symptoms using a large sample of African American, white, Hispanic/Latino, Southeast Asian, and South Asian/East Indian students. Preliminary analyses indicated that Southeast and South Asian/East Indian participants reported significantly more symptoms on the Padua Inventory Washington State University Revision, although only South Asian/East Indian participants also reported a correspondingly higher rate of interference and distress associated with their symptoms. Comparable psychometric estimates were observed across all groups. Differences by race/ethnicity are discussed regarding potential variables that may act as moderators or mediators in addition to clinical and research implications.

Furthermore, it will expose and challenge the global racial hierarchy that continues to uphold an obsolete and destructive system of social organization, despite efforts to repackage it as color blindness. The social justice pedagogy described herein (called MRULE, or Multi-Racial Unity Learning Experience) interrogates this system, rejects spurious claims of egalitarianism, and stimulates new patterns of thinking and acting that move authentically toward justice. Application of this pedagogical approach is reviewed here in a university cocurricular program conducted from 1996 to the present. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: Paratonia is an external stimulus dependent increase in muscle tone that is absent at rest. It is thought to occur commonly in Alzheimer disease (AD) but is understudied. This study examines paratonia in a multiracial sample. Methods: The sample consisted of 80 patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-TV) criteria for AD. They received a battery of neuropsychiatric assessments. The authors examined the relationship between paratonia and multiple variables. Results: Bivariate and logistic regression analyses revealed that paratonia correlated significantly with disease stage (based on the Geriatric Depression Scale) and number of frontal release symptoms. There were no significant correlations of paratonia with age, race, sex, depression, physical health, neuroimaging findings, functioning, or neuropsychiatric symptoms. The authors found significant association with frontal symptoms. Conclusions: The potential utility of paratonia as an independent marker of disease stage in AD and its role in signifying frontal lobe dysfunction suggests that closer attention should be paid to its assessment.

Abstract = {Research on multiracial individuals is often cross-sectional, obscuring the fluid nature of multiracial self-categorization across time. Pathways of racial self-identification are developed from a nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 14-18, measured again 5 years later. A significant proportion of multiracial adolescents change racial self-identification across time. Youth who ever report being multiracial are 4 times as likely to switch self-identification as to report consistent multiracial identities. Across this time, more multiracial adolescents either add a racial category (diversify) or subtract one (consolidate) than maintain consistent multiracial self-categorization. Exploratory multinomial analyses show few differences between these pathways on select psychological and social characteristics. Results lend quantitative support to qualitative studies indicating the fluidity of racial self-categorization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: There have been few multiracial epidemiologic community-based studies of phobia in older adults. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of phobia and associated factors among older persons living in a northeastern urban area. Methods: Using 1990 census data for Brooklyn, NY, the authors attempted to interview all persons age 55 + in randomly selected block groups. The final sample consisted of 214 whites and 860 blacks. The authors used an adaptation of George's Social Antecedent Model for examining the association of 18 individual variables and one interactive variable with the presence of a phobia. The dependent variable was derived from the Guy's/Age Concern community survey. The sample was weighted by race and gender. To control for design effects, the authors used SUDAAN for the data analysis. Results: A total of 8.9% of the sample met criteria for a current phobia and 10.2% met phobia criteria at some time during their life. Using logistic regression analysis, the authors found six variables--higher personal income, more depressive symptoms, poorer physical health, use of prayer as a coping strategy, use of spiritualists or their products, and not having been raised by both parents--to be significantly associated with a current phobia. Conclusion: The prevalence rate of phobia was comparable to rates for older adults in the urban areas of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study suggesting that prevalence has remained stable over the past two decades. Consistent with earlier studies, there were significant associations among phobia, depressive symptoms, and physical illness. Many of the demographic and social variables, including race, that had been reported previously to be associated with phobias in younger samples were not significant in this study.

We focus on group-related identities and identity formation in relation to these three broad dimensions of society. We first define the populations most clearly involved in multiple social categorization in terms of race, ethnicity, and culture. We present briefly the historical and cultural context for understanding these group-related identity issues in the United States, and we define key concepts for the purposes of the chapter. We discuss identity formation as an approach to understanding the role of multiple categorization in individuals' lives. We then review literature on identity issues among multiracial, multiethnic and multicultural individuals. We conclude with a consideration of the implications of multiple categories and identities.

We invited 131 adult patients [44 Malays, 42 Chinese and 45 Indians; mean (95% CI) age: 43 (40.2-45.7) yrs; 28.2% male] with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma followed up in an urban-based hospital outpatient clinic to complete a disease-specific HRQL questionnaire [St Georges' Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)] and to provide socio-demographic and asthma-related data. Indians reported significantly worse SGRQ total score, compared to Malays [mean (95% CI) difference: 10.15 (0.51-19.78); p = 0.037] and SGRQ activity score, compared to Malays [13.50 (1.95-25.05); p = 0.019] and Chinese [11.88 (0.19-25.05); p = 0.046]. Further analysis using multivariate linear regression showed that Indian ethnicity remained independently associated with SGRQ scores. Our finding highlights the relevance of ethnicity in assessing HRQL of asthmatic patients in a multiracial country such as Malaysia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This article, which utilizes personal experience as well as other perspectives and theories on race and mixed race, suggests that multiracial identity is a manifestation of recent date that differs from traditional conceptions and descriptions of mixed race that conform to the dichotomous and hierarchical logic of the binary racial system. As delineated in this article, the emergence of multiracial identity is properly understood in the context of the post-civil rights era and has been coextensive with multiculturalism, the proliferation of information technologies, and with the emergence of the multiracial political movement in the 1990s. Further, this article suggests that multiracial identity is also in part a by-product of multicultural American universities of the 1980s and 1990s. That is, multiracial identity has to a certain extent taken shape in reaction to the rigid ethnoracial boundaries and discourses that are imposed on mixed race students in the multicultural academy.

Abstract = {According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 6.8 million people, or 2.4% of the national population, identified themselves by two or more races (i.e., biracial or multiracial; Jones & Smith, 2001). Nearly 1.8 million of these individuals reported being Black or African American in combination with another racial or ethnic group. Reported population figures regarding biracial African Americans, however, may be underestimations of the actual size of this population (Brown, 1995; Root, 1996). In particular, the degree to which parents of interracial children address their children's racial group orientation and how people of mixed race heritage identify with either or both racial groups may influence population estimates (Winn & Priest, 1993). In this chapter, we provide some background information pertaining to the historical and current experiences of biracial and multiracial African Americans. We also discuss considerations in the self-identification process for biracial and multiracial African Americans, and we present several prominent identity development models for biracial and multiracial people. In addition, we present issues that mental health counselors might wish to consider when working with biracial and multiracial African Americans.

Abstract = {This chapter argues for the use of new methods to assess racial prejudice because existing methods only provide a piecemeal understanding of the phenomenon, leading to an under-assessment of key constructs (e.g., ingroup favoritism, outgroup derogation) and provide no precision to assess new constructs, such as generalized outgroup derogation (negativity directed at all outgroups equally) and selective outgroup derogation (negativity directed at a specific outgroup or specific outgroups). The use of new response options, multiple targets, and multiple perceivers integrated into a single instrument is encouraged. The multidimensional architecture of the proposed instrument will allow researchers to uncover new constructs (e.g., selective or generalized outgroup derogation) and improve the assessment of existing constructs (e.g., ingroup favoritism, outgroup derogation) associated with racial prejudice. This chapter concludes by arguing that the methodological and theoretical clarity offered by these new methods in a single instrument will supplement and advance our understanding of racial prejudice, and that the approach is equally applicable to both the child and adult literatures.

We use the 1990 US Census, which affords a unique look at racial identification because multiracial people were required to choose one race over another. The results show support for our argument that place plays a central role in Pacific identity processes, illustrated in this case among Hawaiians. We find that strong ties to Hawaii - the spiritual and geographic home of the Hawaiian population - are vital to the intergenerational transmission of Hawaiian identification in both continental and island multiracial families. We compare our results for multiracial Native Hawaiians to prior studies of American Indians and Asian Americans to identify any general patterns in correlates of racial identification choices. In each group, we find that familial and geographic relationships to the cultural and ancestral lands are strongly linked to racial identification.

This study explores the racial identity of multiracial Asians in the United States, using survey data on 110 Asian-white adults, and examines the factors that shape this identity. The literature suggests a number of factors; drawing on the theoretical framework of reflected appraisals, I hypothesize that certain factors will be more important than others in this process. When respondents were asked with which race they identified more strongly, Asian or white, two factors were shown to exert the strongest influence on racial identity, namely phenotype and cultural exposure. Logistic regression and qualitative responses reveal that the racial identities of this sample of Asian-white adults are shaped largely by the reflected appraisals of others regarding their appearance and cultural knowledge.

Abstract = {As an analytical framework, multiracial feminism is inclusive, as it acknowledges the experiences of both women and men, unlike other forms of second-wave feminism. This framework recognizes that gender is experienced not in a vacuum, but, rather, concurrently with numerous factors such as race, ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation. More importantly, it acknowledges that different social locations (e.g., gender, race, class) and settings interact, resulting in a differential experience of power, that is, a Chicana/o can feel powerful and powerless depending on the setting and situation. It is our contention that multiracial feminism provides Chicana/o psychology with a framework for research, theory, and practice that extends beyond focusing solely on the examination of intrapsychic factors, a practice in which the impact and power of social structures remain obscure and in which it is hard to identify areas of strength and resilience. In this chapter we seek to relocate our gendered experiences in Chicana/o psychology within the framework of multiracial feminism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Over the past four decades, immigration has increased the racial and ethnic diversity in the United States. Once a mainly biracial society with a large white majority and relatively small black minority--and an impenetrable color line dividing these groups--the United States is now a society composed of multiple racial and ethnic groups. Along with increased immigration are rises in the rates of racial/ethnic intermarriage, which in turn have led to a sizeable and growing multiracial population. Currently, 1 in 40 persons identifies himself or herself as multiracial, and this figure could soar to 1 in 5 by the year 2050. Increased racial and ethnic diversity brought about by the new immigration, rising intermarriage, and patterns of multiracial identification may be moving the nation far beyond the traditional and relatively persistent black/white color line. In this chapter, we review the extant theories and recent findings concerning immigration, intermarriage, and multiracial identification, and consider the implications for America's changing color lines. In particular, we assess whether racial boundaries are fading for all groups or whether America's newcomers are simply crossing over the color line rather than helping to eradicate it.

Participants assessed the child using a revision of Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Children and a revised version of Kovacs's Children's Depression Inventory--Short Form. Ratings of the child's global self-worth and depressive symptoms were negatively correlated. The results of a 2×2×3 MANOVA revealed a significant three-way interaction for the races of the child, the respondent, and the child's friends on adults' ratings of the child's peer acceptance. The implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Patterns of racial classification in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health are examined. The survey's large sample size and multiple indicators of race permit generalizable claims about patterns and processes of social construction in the racial categorization of adolescents. In examining racial fluidity, the authors (1) contrast counts of multiracial youth obtained from common schemes of racial classification, (2) describe individual-level patterns of consistency in racial reporting, and (3) examine how youth who self-identify as multiracial answer questions that insist upon single-race responses. About 12% of youth provide inconsistent responses to nearly identical questions about race. The authors conclude that context affects one's choice of a single-race identity, and nearly all patterns and processes of racial classification depend on which racial groups are involved. The implications of the findings are discussed for users of data on race in general, and for the new census data in particular. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Few therapists are trained to work with multiracial individuals. Most have little knowledge of the process of identity development in this ever-increasing population. In this article, an examination of how the social construction of race impacts identity development is followed by a review of current theories regarding multiracial identity development. Interviews of clinicians illustrate how therapists understand their work with multiracial clients as well as the issues they have personally confronted. The challenges faced by therapists working with this population center on understanding how oppression affects identity development, supporting racial ambiguity as a part of normal identity development, working from a nonoppressive theoretical perspective, and examining their own internalized rules about racial and ethnic stereotypes. This preliminary examination indicates the need for further research. A controlled study in this area would be of benefit to the field. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {J.B. Biggs' (1987) Learning Process Questionnaire (LPQ) is a widely acknowledged measure of student approaches to learning. However, its utility in predicting actual school achievement and in multi-cultural contexts is unknown. This study investigated the validity of J.B. Biggs' LPQ and its underlying theory in predicting academic achievement in Zimbabwean multiracial schools. 376 Zimbabwean black and white students (mean age 12.3 yrs) attending 6 racially integrated schools took part in the study. Students who reportedly used a surface approach to learning achieved lower levels of academic achievement compared to those who reportedly used deep and achieving approaches. Compared to white students, black students who reported higher use of a deep approach had lower academic grades. Students who reported a higher use of a surface strategy and taught by female teachers displayed significantly lower academic achievement than those who reported use of deep approaches. Support was found for the LPQ and its underlying theory. They appear to have some potential as research tool for use in Zimbabwean multiracial schools.

In the 1st study, an initial version of the AMCS was administered to 250 college students (aged 17–51 yrs) from racially/ethnically diverse backgrounds. The results reveal that scores on the 43-item scale were internally consistent and that 4 factors (i.e., Multiracial Identity, Multiracial Heritage, General Adjustment, and Social Relationships) could be identified. In the 2nd study, the AMCS was revised and administered to a group of 187 Ss. Again, factor analysis yielded a 4-factor solution (i.e., Psychosocial Adjustment Self-Esteem, Multiracial Identity, and Multiracial Heritage). The internal consistency for scores on the resulting 23-item scale was good and 3-week test–retest reliability (n = 15) was .77. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The multiracial categories used here are derived from youths' reports of their own and their parents' race(s). Comparisons are made within groups of multiracial respondents who make different choices among single-race categories. Results show differences between subgroups in strength and importance of ethnic identity, self-esteem, and perceptions of ethnic discrimination. Multinomial logistic regression shows further that physiognomy, ethnic identity, and race of coresident parent(s) are significantly associated with reported race. Also related to racial identification among part-Hispanic youth are the racial distribution and socioeconomic status of their neighborhoods and the racial distributions of their schools.

We examine students' perceptions of school support for postsecondary participation and test alternative measures of school racial composition in order to account for the increasingly multiracial makeup of today's urban high schools. We include both school-level and student-level characteristics in a multilevel logistic regression model to see if perceived school support for higher educational attainment differs by school racial composition. The results provide support for the hypothesis that school racial composition and school support have an effect on students' reported educational aspirations, and that alternative specifications of school racial composition provide different interpretations of these important relationships.

Each chapter offers new perspectives on standing issues, with practical information about how to cope with prejudice and discrimination. The "toolbox" at the end of each chapter suggests steps to be taken at different levels to combat prejudice and discrimination and to achieve change. In the second volume of this series, Ethnicity and Multiracial Identity, the text looks at discrimination toward differences due to immigration, language, culture, and mixed race. Written for today's people and environment, these volumes are rich with anecdotes, stories, examples, and research. These stories illustrate the emotional impact of prejudice and discrimination throughout history and as it still strikes people's lives today. While the chapters spotlight psychology, they interweave history, politics, legislation, social change, education, and more. These interdisciplinary views reflect the broad contexts of prejudice and discrimination that ultimately affect identity, life adjustment, and well-being for every one of us.

The psychometric properties and mean differences on the MEIM for White, monoracial minority, and multiracial early adolescents were investigated. Principal components and multigroup confirmatory factor analysis were used to explore and confirm the factor structure of the MEIM items. Two factors were identified: (1) identification and (2) exploration. Identification was represented by items that reflect a sense of belonging and pride in an individual's ethnic group. Exploration was represented by items that characterize a search for ethnic group identity and participation in ethnic practices. Results show reliabilities for the 2 subscales were α = .84 for identification and α = .76 for exploration. Also, the results indicate that most individuals from monoracial minority groups and multiracial subgroups scored similarly on overall ethnic identity.

Abstract = {Objective: To describe the prevalence of menopausal symptoms, define the mean age of menopause, and determine contributory factors, which influence the experience of symptoms among Singaporean women of different racial groups. Design: Cross-sectional nation-wide study of a random sample of 1000 women drawn from the entire population of Singaporean female (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) citizens between 45 and 60 years of age. Face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaires were conducted. Results: The response rate was 69.9%. The mean age of natural menopause was 49.0 years. This was not significantly different between the three ethnic groups. Increasing parity delayed the age of menopause (P = 0.007). Muscle and joint ache was the most commonly reported symptom (52.6%). Although the prevalence of significant hot flushes in the general study population was low (3.9%), it was the most commonly reported complaint by peri-menopausal women (14.6%). Prevalence of significant hot flushes decreased with time from menopause (P = 0.007) and completely disappeared beyond the fifth year of menopause. Recent unhappy events were associated with an increased risk of symptoms (P < 0.001). Women of Chinese origin experienced a lower risk of menopausal symptoms when compared with other ethnic groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The mean age of menopause was 49.0 years among Singaporean women. Ethnicity and recent unhappy events were two major factors, which influenced the risk of experiencing menopausal symptoms. Among the three ethnic groups studied, Chinese women were the least likely to experience disturbing menopausal symptoms. The overall prevalence of menopausal symptoms was low when compared to studies on women in western societies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Data were gathered in a random national telephone survey. Results indicate that for Blacks racial-ethnic identity is a more important component of self-concept than it is for multiracials and Whites (both of whom say they place little importance on it). Other findings show that the importance of racial-ethnic identity varies across settings (e.g., it is most important for Blacks at work and least important at home) and that in general the multiracials are not highly distinguishable from both Blacks and Whites, Moreover, an interesting and unexpected finding is that for all three groups, the single most important identity is sex/gender.

Abstract = {Deficiencies in "basic trust" frequently undermine the efficacy of group therapy in multiracial and multicultural groups. It is necessary to distinguish trust deficits caused by individual psychopathology, societal attitudes ("cultural pathology"), or a combination of both. A typology for classifying self-disclosure problems in multicultural and multiracial groups is presented, and illustrated with case material: Mode A, "Good enough trust," allows patient self-disclosure in multicultural groups; Mode B, Low level of cultural paranoia and high level of functional paranoia; Mode C, Culturally paranoid individual can self-disclose in culturally homogeneous group but mistrusts outsiders; Mode D, Confluent paranoid has high levels of both functional and cultural paranoia. For Modes C and D, it is crucial that experiences of bias be acknowledged and empathized with first before patients will be able to achieve good enough trust to risk self-disclosure. The ethnic composition of the group must be attended to in the placement of these patients. Hospital (inpatient) groups are especially likely to have problems with basic trust. The role of the leader in demonstrating empathy, tolerance, racial sensitivity, and appropriate self-disclosure is emphasized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this brief chapter, the author hopes to achieve two goals: (1) to introduce readers to issues, challenges, and barriers faced by multiracial individuals and interracial families in the United States and (2) to suggest counseling strategies for helping people in the mixed-race population to overcome these barriers. The history of race mixing in the United States is addressed in Wehrly (1996) and Wehrly, Kenney, and Kenney (1999) and will not be repeated here. After a section on definitions of terms pertinent to the interracial population, this chapter will concentrate on societal and professional issues related to work with the mixed-race population and on counseling strategies to assist mixed-race individuals and families in breaking barriers that may be inhibiting the attainment of their full human potential.

Abstract = {When people of different races come together in treatment, task, and support groups, race is always a salient factor. The extensive literature related to racially, ethnically, and culturally sensitive group practice promotes awareness and offers guidelines, but there has been no systematic evaluation of how effective these guidelines are in preparing students for multiracial practice with groups. This pilot study evaluated the use of the RAP (Recognize, Anticipate, and Problem- Solve) model, a framework for leading multiracial groups, for teaching MSW students. The student Ss in this study reported significant gains on dimensions related to comfort in discussing racial differences between worker and members and among members, skills in talking about differences, knowledge about interventions, and their ability to identify issues and problems. Reports of concerns about issues and problems did not change significantly. Identification of specific concerns about leading multiracial groups and open-ended responses provide useful information about future training needs.

The current study expanded on their research by manipulating both the race (Asian American, Black, Hispanic, White) and quality of the résumé (high, low), and by considering occupational stereotypes as an explanatory mechanism. White male participants (N= 155) read a fictitious résumé, evaluated the applicant, and judged his suitability for jobs. The results revealed that Asian American individuals were evaluated highly for high-status jobs, regardless of their résumé quality. White and Hispanic applicants both benefited from a high-quality résumé, but Black applicants were evaluated negatively, even with strong credentials. Results of mediation analyses demonstrated that occupational stereotypes accounted for the relationship between race and evaluations of applicants.

A wide range of indicators for emotional and behavioral adjustment were used to examine the extent to which multiracial adolescents differed in their level of adjustment problems from their single-race peers. For purposes of this study, the term multiracial was defined on the basis of parent responses to questions about their racial/ethnic backgrounds. The final sample used in the study consisted of single-race White, single-race minority, and multiracial adolescents. Significant differences were found on fewer than half of the school, behavioral, and psychological dimensions that were assessed. Implications for research and school interventions are discussed.

Abstract = {Purpose: Most patients and families with dementia are cared for in primary care clinics. These clinics are seldom designed to provide the necessary comprehensive care. The purpose of this article is to describe nonpharmacologic protocols for the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease and their families that are administered as part of a multifaceted care-management intervention program in a multiracial primary care clinic. Design & Methods: The nonpharmacologic component for the integrated program of collaborative care was developed based on a literature review and previous clinical experience. The care is coordinated by a geriatric nurse practitioner who meets with patients, families, and the primary care physicians. The nonpharmacologic protocols included general educational guidelines about Alzheimer's disease. Specific protocols to treat the common behavioral disturbances associated with Alzheimer's disease also were developed. A major component of the intervention is a monthly psycho-educational support group for caregivers. Results: The intervention has been well accepted by patients, families, and physicians. Approximately one-half of the treatment group has participated in the support group regularly. Implications: The integration of behavioral interventions and team care within the primary care environment has been successful. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy occurs worldwide, but to our knowledge, only two Japanese studies have described the clinical response to IVIg in the Asian population. As CIDP is a heterogeneous disorder, future studies using standardized protocols will help address clinical responses of IVIg in the various subtypes, particularly, in the Asian population. Nonetheless, our experience has contributed additional evidence attesting to the excellent efficacy and safety profile of IVIg in the Asian setting, regardless of type. It thus provides further support for its universal usage, specifically in the management of CIDP. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

A self-description questionnaire and multiple measures of social acceptance were used. Although Black children had levels of global self-esteem comparable with, or higher than, that of their White classmates, Black pupils taught by White teachers had significantly lower reading and academic self-esteem. Pupils in classes taught by Black teachers tended to choose for best friends peers in other classes significantly more than did pupils in classes taught by White teachers. Analysis by gender indicated that males tended to have significantly higher physical ability, physical appearance, and math self-esteem and relatively higher levels of social participation than females.

Rather, they begin as survival strategies in response to racism, homophobia, classism, the stress of acculturation, and emotional, physical, and sexual abuse.

Abstract = {How will racial divisions in student friendship networks change as U.S. schools incorporate a growing Asian and Hispanic population? Drawing on theories of race in assimilation processes and the effects of relative group size on intergroup relations, several hypotheses are developed to address this question. These hypotheses are tested using data on friendships among students in grades 7 to 12 from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Key findings are that (1) cross-race friendships including Asian and Hispanic students are more common than those between white and black students, but race and Hispanic background have significant influences on student friendships that persist over immigrant generations; (2) black or white racial identifications are strongly associated with the friendship choices of Hispanic students; (3) cross-race friendships increase with school racial diversity; and (4) own-group friend selection intensifies for students in small racial minorities in a school. The results support theories of racially segmented patterns of assimilation in primary group relations and suggest that students in small racial minorities seek to maintain a friendship network including several own-race friends. Implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Illustrates the clinical use of a postmodern family therapy that makes race, racism and family identity central themes in therapeutic dialogues with transracial, adoptive families, specifically Black children adopted into White families. The author states that this approach honors ideas that have sprung from the work of postmodern family therapists which can be helpful in fostering the development of family cohesion, multicultural perspectives, and antiracist strategies. An illustration of this approach is presented through the case report of a White mother seeking a Black therapist to counsel and serve as a positive role model for her 15-yr-old adopted daughter who was Black. The client was described as falling in and out of latent hostility and closing herself off from the rest of the family (consisting of the mother, father, 17-yr-old son, and 8-yr-old daughter) all of whom were White. The client was also reported to be experiencing problems at school. This case illustrates that, for the Black adopted child, identity issues are extremely complex and both the identity and family-building process is contaminated by racial prejudice and discrimination. Guidelines are offered for therapists working with multiracial family issues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Couples therapy and the study of couples seems to be of great interest to many in recent years. Multiracial Couples: Black & White Voices is designed to share the experiences of 21 heterosexual, black and white couples from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The book focuses more on each couple's experiences rather than the theory of multiracial couples and racism. Minimal interpretation is offered allowing the actual voices of the people interviewed to truly be heard. Taken as a whole, the book does offer a legitimate contribution to the literature. Many works written on cultural diversity and mental health are conveyed through the eyes of professionals not necessarily those that are being helped. This book presents a different perspective on how to view multiracial couples and it might assist professionals in alleviating the confusion and pain that couples face.

Abstract = {Brazil is the country that had the largest slave population in the Americas; it is also where the myth of racial democracy still persists. Unlike the US, race relations in Brazil have been developed through miscegenation—the elite has attempted an assimilationist perspective in which miscegenation would incorporate other racial groups through a process of "Whitening." In Brazil, themes such as cultural and racial identities, multicultural education, and race have been insufficiently theorized. Although connected with social class and gender, race as a specific category is discussed in relation to Brazil's denial of racial democracy and teachers and race. The author suggests that although the teachers say that they do not know which children fail more in school (Black or White), they have some expectations that work as prophecies. Through a process that could be called tacit contract between teachers, school, and system, teaching must be "Whitened" and Dark and Black children, in order to obtain success in school, must "Whiten" themselves.

Abstract = {Perceptions of threat occupy a central place in race relations in Blumer's theory of prejudice but few direct efforts to study such perceptions exist. Extending Blumer's reasoning, the authors hypothesize such perceptions are driven by a group's feelings of racial alienation within the larger social order. The more that members of a particular racial group feel collectively oppressed and unfairly treated by society, the more likely they are to perceive members of other groups as potential threats. The authors also examine whether such perceptions spring from simple self-interest, orthodox prejudice such as negative feelings and stereotyping, or broad beliefs about social stratification inequality. The authors use data from the 1992 Los Angeles County Social Survey to analyze the distribution and social and psychological underpinnings of perceived group competition. The authors results support the racial alienation hypothesis as well as the hypotheses positing effects for self-interest, prejudice, and stratification beliefs. The authors argue that Blumer's group-position framework offers the most parsimonious integration and interpretation of the social psychological processes involved in the formation of perceptions of group threat and competition.

This study investigated the rescreening behavior of 52 low-income women (aged 52–63 yrs) by conducting 8 focus groups in Texas with enrollees who had access to free mammograms. Concerns mentioned in the focus groups included fear of radiation, anxiety that the test might not find a cancer that was there, and worries that cancer might be detected. In all groups, some women mentioned the embarrassment, discomfort, or pain they experienced during a prior mammogram, although no one indicated they would refuse to have another mammogram because of these concerns. Findings highlight the useful insights that can be obtained from focus groups and underscore the need for more research on aspects of the experience of mammography that may affect rescreening.

The primary objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of 13 self-reported delinquent behaviors in the sample, to compare these rates among the three groups of students, and to explore the predictive influences of several family factors that correlate with delinquency. It was found that 37.5% of the sample engaged in one or more acts of serious delinquency, with AfricanAmericans reporting they had engaged in significantly more of these behaviors. The best predictors of theft/vandalism were low family pride and family substance abuse for Hispanics, low family communication for African-Americans, and low family pride for White non-Hispanics. The findings indicate that traditional family factors that have been used repeatedly to understand delinquency by male adolescents were not strong predictors of delinquency among the adolescent girls in the sample.

(see record [rid]1992-97305-000[/rid]). In this edited volume, Root presents a new paradigm for the emerging multiracial population in America. The call for deconstruction of existing theory and the creation of new paradigms for understanding and investigating the multicultural experience is a major premise of this book. Existing social, political, and theoretical frameworks--based on monocultural, monoracial, linear models of social relations and social identity--have forced biracial individuals to choose one or the other culture and to deny significant parts of their heritage and existence. These models mirror the dichotomous, forced choice schemes of racial classification. This volume seeks to correct these practices and perceptions by presenting alternative approaches to social identity and racial classification based on the incorporation of simultaneous membership and multiple, fluid identities.

Abstract = {Reviews findings in the area of race-relations training (RRT) and makes suggestions that should assist trainers in their challenging work. Evidence indicates that RRT tends to espouse 5 interpersonal behavioral objectives. These are (1) discussion of race-related issues, (2) articulation of other groups' perspectives, (3) examination of other groups' perspectives, (4) finding validity in other groups' perspectives, and (5) using others' perspectives to work together more effectively toward common goals. Approaches to RRT include a didactic model, experiential training, and a groupwork model. Groupwork goals are identified, and 3 major aspects of organizing a groupwork program are discussed: the trainer, the participants, and the training situation.

Abstract = {This study was undertaken as one part of a more extensive survey on inter-ethnic attitudes and behavior in the context of multiracial education in English schools. The analysis was based on data collected from 3,551 English primary and secondary school students in 3 age groups (10+, 12+, and 14+ yrs) and of varying ethnic origins. A pilot study, conducted with 514 of the Ss, identified 33 core items for the attitude questionnaire. Results of the main part of the study reveal some significant difference in attitudes: (a) Girls were generally more concerned than boys about their school work. (b) The older age groups had less favorable attitudes to the multiracial school than the younger Ss. (c) Of all the ethnic groups in the sample the Ss of Asian family background had the most positive attitude toward the multiracial school and were the group most concerned about their school work.

Abstract = {This study provides a demographic portrait of multiracial households, using children as the units of analysis. The authors conceptualize three dimensions for understanding multiracialness: (1) the racial composition of a household overall, (2) where in the household a racial difference exists relative to the household head, and (3) where in the household a racial difference exists relative to each child. Using microdata from the 1980 U.S. census, the authors explore the first two of these dimensions and test two propositions about the links between racial diversity and other nonracial attributes of children's household environments. The finding is made, among other things, that the largest proportion of children live in Asian-white households, and that about 60% live in households headed by mixed-race couples. Support for the notion that attributes of multiracial households fall between those of their same-race counterparts was mixed. Nonetheless, there appears to be a link between location of diversity and some nonracial characteristics of the household. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

The 2nd part of a 2-part study, the present article reports findings on those items which concerned teachers' appraisals of various aspects of ethnic minority and indigenous pupils and the overall effects of the multiracial composition of the school on the teacher. There was a high degree of consensus of opinion regarding the academic and social behavior of pupils of West Indian origin. Regarding the other minority groups specified (Asian and European), the greatest concensus of opinion concerned pupils of Asian origins. Teachers felt that Asian pupils did not resent reprimand any more than indigenous pupils. Teachers appeared to be unwilling to make the generalizations posed by the questions regarding pupils of European origin. The possibility of stereotyping by the teachers, particularly regarding West Indian students, is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The following 6 hypotheses were tested: (1) The greater the number of Blacks in the multiracial group, the higher the level of interracial conflict. (2) The greater the difference in earnings between Blacks and Whites in a multiracial group, the higher the level of interracial conflict. (3) The greater the average age of Whites in the multiracial group, the higher the level of interracial conflict. (4) The lower the average age of Blacks in the multiracial group, the higher the level of interracial conflict.

Abstract = {Social work scholarship concerned with mixed-race and queer identities is growing and ever-changing, yet often treats race and sexuality as separate experiences independent from context and environment. In addition, in studies of mixed-race people, the legacy of the Black-White/US-based multiracial paradigm and the history of such research using race as the only or primary analytic has left a dearth of studies that seek to understand mixed-race experiences within geographical, transnational and intersectional contexts. In this paper, we extend previous work focused on situational and contextual multiracial identities through an interview-based study of a sample of 12 queer and mixed-race individuals. We employ a narrative analysis to explore how emergent themes of geography and migration are salient to self-making processes of participants. Findings include: (1) diverse geographic and migration histories among participants; (2) interviewees’ use of discursive strategies that draw upon experiences of geography and migration within the narrative structure; and (3) the critical role of geography and migration in expanding and changing participants’ identity discourses and in shaping individuals’ identity and sense of community. Ultimately, this work serves as a call for on-going attention to how geography and migration, as well as intersectional and transnational perspectives, add depth and texture to studies of queer-mixed people while also offering specificity to social work’s broader commitment to context and environment.

Abstract = {Rigid thinking is associated with less creativity, suggesting that priming a flexible mind-set should boost creative thought. In three studies, we investigate whether priming multiple social identities predicts more creativity in domains unrelated to social identity. Study 1 asked monoracial and multiracial participants to write about their racial identities before assessing creativity. Priming a multiracial’s racial identity led to greater creativity compared to a no-prime control. Priming a monoracial’s racial identity did not affect creativity. Study 2 showed that reminding monoracials that they, too, have multiple identities increased creativity. Study 3 replicated this effect and demonstrated that priming a multiracial identity for monoracials did not affect creativity. These results are the first to investigate the association between flexible identities and flexible thinking, highlighting the potential for identity versatility to predict cognitive differences between individuals who have singular versus multifaceted views of their social selves.

Certain disorders common in one race group are rarely present in another. The psychiatrist contributes to maintenance of public order. The psychiatrist's language affiliation is relevant. The psychiatrist's race status affects his patients. Until urgent clinical needs are met, research does not get done. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The relation between multiracial identity selection and psychological outcomes related to the self and well-being was explored among minority/White biracials spanning four different mixed-race groups (n = 201): Black/Whites, East Asian/Whites, Latino/Whites, and South Asian/Whites. The mixed-race groups showed considerable variability in their selection of multiracial identity categories and different patterns of identity selection, as well as a higher overall representation of transcendent identity (i.e., identity that challenges traditional notions of race) than reported in previously published studies. Our findings demonstrated that biracial identity selection, especially when differentiating between identities that are socially validated or not socially validated by others, was related to a person's level of multiracial identity integration, identification with Whites, perceived discrimination from Whites and non-Whites, and psychological well-being. Identity selection groups did not significantly differ from each other in levels of self-concept clarity or identification with their non-White racial group. Theoretical implications for extending a multidimensional model to other mixed-race groups and redefining race as a social and cultural construction are discussed.

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of the present study was to develop an instrument to measure “internalized racism” called appropriated racial oppression for people of Color. Method: Generated items were reviewed by experts in the areas of multicultural psychology and scale construction. A total sample of 656 adults was collected in 2 phases: The first phase consisted of 341 adults (Age: M = 35, SD = 12.05). Of these, 99 were Black, 70 multiracial, 61 Asian, 61 Latino, 37 Native American, 10 identified as “other,” and 3 participants did not answer. Most were female (n = 256), and heterosexual (n = 277). In the second phase, there were 315 adults (Age: M = 35; SD = 12.05). Eighty were Black, 68 Multiracial, 56 Asian, 54 Latino, 40 Native American, 16 were other and 1 participant did not answer. Two-thirds were female (n = 216) and heterosexual (n = 251). Results: The 341 adult participants’ responses were used to run exploratory factor analysis that revealed a 32-item, 4-factor structure for the construct of appropriated racial oppression. The 315 adult participants’ data were used in a confirmatory factor analysis that resulted in a 4-factor, 24-item model fit. To test for both predictive and criterion-related validity, a path analysis was conducted. Results of the path analysis demonstrated significant relationships between appropriated racial oppression and anxiety and depression. Conclusion: It has been found that there is preliminary evidence for the validity of the newly developed Appropriated Racial Oppression Scale. Moreover, results of this study provide critical information in assisting clinicians treating individuals with appropriated racial oppression.

Abstract = {This study examined factors that influenced the use of skills taught in a school-based universal violence prevention program. Interviews were conducted with 91 students from two urban schools (83% were African American and 12% multiracial) and 50 students from a nearby county school (52% were White, 32% African American, and 12% multiracial). About half the sample (54%) was male. All had been in sixth grade classrooms where the Second Step (Committee for Children, 1997b) violence prevention curriculum had been implemented earlier in the school year or in the preceding school year. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts suggested that participants' use of intervention skills was influenced by their beliefs and values, perceived relevance and effectiveness of the skill, issues related to enacting the behavior, and contextual factors. These findings highlight the need for a more intensive and comprehensive effort to address barriers and supports that influence the relevance and impact of school-based violence prevention programs.

Abstract = {Importance: Understanding the relationships between age-related changes in brain structure and cognitive function has been limited by inconsistent methods for assessing brain imaging, small sample sizes, and racially/ethnically homogeneous cohorts with biased selection based on risk factors. These limitations have prevented the generalizability of results from brain morphology studies. Objective: To determine the association of 3.0-T structural brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measurements with cognitive function in the multiracial/multiethnic, population-based Dallas Heart Study. Design, Setting, and Participants: Whole-brain, 2-dimensional, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and 3-dimensional, magnetization-prepared, rapid acquisition with gradient echo MR imaging at 3.0 T was performed in 1645 Dallas Heart Study participants (mean [SD] age, 49.9 [10.5] years; age range, 19-85 years) who received both brain MR imaging and cognitive screening with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment between September 18, 2007, and December 28, 2009. Measurements were obtained for white matter hyperintensity volume, total brain volume, gray matter volume, white matter volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, and hippocampal volume. Linear regression and a best predictive model were developed to determine the association of MR imaging biomarkers with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment total score and domain-specific questions. Main Outcomes and Measures: High-resolution anatomical MR imaging was used to quantify brain volumes. Scores on the screening Montreal Cognitive Assessment were used for cognitive assessment in participants. Results: After adjustment for demographic variables, total brain volume (P < .0001, standardized estimate [SE] = .1069), gray matter volume (P < .0001, SE = .1156), white matter volume (P = .008, SE = .0687), cerebrospinal fluid volume (P = .012, SE = −.0667), and hippocampal volume (P < .0001) were significantly associated with cognitive performance. A best predictive model identified gray matter volume (P < .001, SE = .0021), cerebrospinal fluid volume (P = .01, SE = .0024), and hippocampal volume (P = .004, SE = .1017) as 3 brain MR imaging biomarkers significantly associated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment total score. Questions specific to the visuospatial domain were associated with the most brain MR imaging biomarkers (total brain volume, gray matter volume, white matter volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, and hippocampal volume), while questions specific to the orientation domain were associated with the least brain MR imaging biomarkers (only hippocampal volume). Conclusions and Relevance: Brain MR imaging volumes, including total brain volume, gray matter volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, and hippocampal volume, were independently associated with cognitive function and may be important early biomarkers of risk for cognitive insult in a young multiracial/multiethnic population. A best predictive model indicated that a combination of multiple neuroimaging biomarkers may be more effective than a single brain MR imaging volume measurement.

Abstract = {Differential response is a growing approach in child welfare that allows for a more flexible response to keep children safe by better engaging families. This study examined the implementation of Minnesota's approach called Family Assessment response, and explored the impact on racial equity outcomes in the state's child welfare system. Using logistic regression to analyze administrative child welfare data for all screened-in cases between 2003 and 2010 (n = 122,095), this study explored whether race was a predictor in the following decision points: (1) pathway assignment to either Family Assessment (FA) response or a traditional investigation (TI); and (2) switching pathway assignment from FA to TI. Findings of the analysis indicated that when controlling for poverty and other risk factors, African American, Native American and Multiracial children were less likely to be assigned to FA compared to Caucasian children for some, but not all years in the study timeframe; while Hispanic children were more likely to be assigned to FA compared to non-Hispanic children for several years in the study timeframe. Disparities around pathway switch from family assessment to traditional investigation completely diminished over time. The results of this study highlight the importance of applying a racial equity lens in examining new policies and practices to ensure equitable implementation for all children and families. The findings also emphasize the need for better understanding of the unique experiences of Native American and Multiracial children and families, who have been under-represented in the research on racial disparities in child welfare.

Abstract = {Background: Understanding minority nurses’ job satisfaction is a critical first step to inform strategies designed to retain minority nurses and improve institutional climate to ensure sustained diversity. Yet, empirical evidence is limited in this regard, especially comparisons across racial and ethnic groups in a national sample in the U.S. Objectives: To determine minority nurses’ job satisfaction across racial and ethnic groups relative to White nurses using a national representative sample. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted using the 2008 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses. The sample includes registered nurses who were primarily employed in nursing in the U.S. Job satisfaction was measured by a single survey item. Racial and ethnic minority status was defined as self-identified membership in a group other than White non-Hispanic, including Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Multiracial. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to compare job satisfaction across racial and ethnic groups while adjusting for individual and job-related characteristics. Results: The majority of nurses were satisfied with their job. The nurse group that had the highest proportion of being satisfied with their job was Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (88.8%), followed by White (81.6%), Asian (81%), Hispanic (78.9%), Black (76%), Multiracial (75.7%), and American Indian/Alaska Native (74.3%). Adjusting for individual and job-related characteristics, evidence indicated the potential for lower job satisfaction among Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Multiracial nurses compared to White nurses. Asian nurses reported the highest levels of neutral (versus dissatisfaction) compared to White nurses. There was no evidence indicating a clear difference in job satisfaction between Hispanic, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and White nurses. Conclusions: Moderate differences in job satisfaction were observed across racial and ethnic groups. More research is needed to understand factors underlying these differences, so that nursing and hospital administrators can develop effective strategies to improve job satisfaction and retain minority nurses.

Respondents completed online measures of their personal ethnic identity (minority, White, and multiracial), perceived parental ethnic identity, parental closeness, and attitudes about the state of race relations and the need for social action in the United States. Using path modeling, results show that part-White biracial individuals perceive their ethnic identity to be strongly linked to their parental racial identities, especially when they had closer parental relationships. Moreover, stronger minority identity was linked to less colorblind attitudes, and greater White identity was linked to greater colorblind attitudes suggesting that patterns of identity may influence how biracial individuals view race-relations and the need for social action.

Methods: Respondents were randomly assigned to three conditions—a control, a treatment that described the president’s biracial ancestry, and a treatment that combined the biracial ancestry information with a statement that Obama had in fact classified himself as black only. All respondents were then asked how they felt Obama should have filled out his Census form. Results. A clear majority of Americans in all experimental conditions said that Obama should have identified himself as both black and white. Conclusion: There appears to be suggesting robust acceptance of official multiracial identification despite the cultural and legal legacy of the “one drop of blood” rule in official U.S. race categorization. A subsequent survey experiment found that a convenience sample of Americans support multiracial identification for mixed-race individuals generally and not only for the president.

Abstract = {Historically, race has been constructed within the American psyche as a dichotomous variable--an either-or proposition. Moreover, our construction and use of language have developed to mirror this reality, which ultimately aids in its perpetuation. Has this divergent approach to race outlived its usefulness and applicability? Is it realistic, given the face of today's changing demographic landscape? At present, there remain cultural and linguistic disconnects between the phenomenological experience of the biracial individual and the expectations of the dualistic society within which they reside. On the individual level, there are implications for psychosocial development (Hall, 2001; Root, 1995). More broadly speaking, what will develop from the resolution of this dilemma is a new paradigm impacting how the citizens of this country view race and racial identity. This paper explores the impact that the sociohistorical constructions of race and language have on the lives of biracial individuals. To this end, the author, who is biracial, will blend sociohistorical conceptions of race and linguistic philosophy with personal narrative components and conclude with implications for multiracial identity development.

Abstract = {The present study investigated how school climate, school connectedness and academic efficacy beliefs inform emergent civic engagement behaviors among middle school youth of color. These associations were examined both concurrently and longitudinally using a developmentally appropriate measure of civic engagement. Data were drawn from two subsamples of a larger study of social/emotional development in middle school (cross-sectional sample n = 324; longitudinal sample n = 232), M = 12 years old, 46 % female, 53 % male. Forty-two percent (42.2 %) of the sample self-identified as African American, 19.8 % as Multiracial or Mixed, 19.4 % as Latino, 11.6 % as Asian American or Pacific Islander, 11.6 % identified as Other, and 5.2 % as Native American. The study tested and found support for a latent mediation model in which more positive perceptions of school climate were positively related to school connectedness, and this in turn, was positively associated with civic engagement; school climate was also positively associated with academic-self-efficacy beliefs, but such beliefs did not mediate the climate-civic engagement association.

Abstract = {The transition to motherhood is widely viewed as a significant life stage for women (race, and ethnic and racial identities that emerge in relation to mothering a child of color. Interviews with 15 Korean American women who were adopted as children by White European American families and who were mothers or intended to be mothers to a multiracial (Asian and White) child were analyzed to develop a grounded theory model of the effects of becoming a mother on the development of ethnic and racial identities. Two interactive processes emerged: Reflecting with Intention and Reframing and Taking Action, which captured connections between the women’s own childhood development and their children’s imagined future development in relation to ethnicity and race. Reflecting with Intention described how the mothers’ sense of responsibility and anticipation of their child’s needs catalyzed reflection upon their own developmental experiences and an associated intention and motivation to foster more positive experiences for their children. This led to the second cycle of Reframing and Taking Action, where the mothers actively sought to increase their cultural knowledge, reframed their earlier experiences in relation to the benefits for their children, worked more actively to resist internalizing racism, and engaged more frequently in ethnic and racial affinity-based experiences.

Abstract = {Sexual esteem is an integral psychological aspect of sexual health (Snell & Papini, 1989), yet it is unclear whether sexual esteem is associated with sexual health behavior among heterosexual men and women. The current analysis used a normative framework for sexual development (Lefkowitz & Gillen, 2006; Tolman & McClelland, 2011) by examining the association of sexual esteem with sexual behavior, contraception use, and romantic relationship characteristics. Participants (N = 518; 56.0% female; mean age = 20.43 years; 26.8% identified as Hispanic/Latino; among non-Hispanic/Latinos, 27.2% of the full sample identified as European American, 22.4% Asian American, 14.9% African American, and 8.7% multiracial) completed Web-based surveys at a large Northeastern university. Participants who had oral sex more frequently, recently had more oral and penetrative sex partners (particularly for male participants), and spent more college semesters in romantic relationships tended to have higher sexual esteem than those who had sex less frequently, with fewer partners, or spent more semesters without romantic partners. Sexually active male emerging adults who never used contraception during recent penetrative sex tended to have higher sexual esteem than those who did use it, whereas female emerging adults who never used contraception tended to have lower sexual esteem than those who did use it. Implications of these results for the development of a healthy sexual self-concept in emerging adulthood are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {While it has been well documented that racial and ethnic disparities exist for children of color in child welfare, the accuracy of the race and ethnicity information collected by agencies has not been examined, nor has the concordance of this information with youth self-report. This article addresses a major gap in the literature by examining 1) the racial and ethnic self-identification of youth in foster care, and the rate of agreement with child welfare and school categorizations; 2) the level of concordance between different agencies (school and child welfare); and 3) the stability of racial and ethnic self-identification among youth in foster care over time. Results reveal that almost 1 in 5 youth change their racial identification over a one-year period, high rates of discordance exist between the youth self-report of Native American, Hispanic and multiracial youth and how agencies categorize them, and a greater tendency for the child welfare system to classify a youth as White, as compared to school and youth themselves. Information from the study could be used to guide agencies towards a more youth-centered and flexible approach in regard to identifying, reporting and affirming youth's evolving racial and ethnic identity.

Abstract = {Although the biracial population is expected to grow at astonishing rates in the upcoming decades across North America, rigorous quantitative psychological research on biracial identity is currently scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine biracial identity profiles in a large sample of Asian-White biracial young adults (n = 330; aged 18–30) living in the United States and Canada, as well as assess the interrelationships among biracial identity and psychological adjustment variables. Grounded in the expanded theoretical model of Multiracial Heritage Awareness and Personal Affiliation (M-HAPA: Choi-Misailidis, 2004) and its corresponding biracial identity measure, cluster analysis was conducted to evaluate participants’ ‘patterns’ or ’profiles’ of scores on biracial identity orientation subscales. Three unique biracial identity groups emerged: the Asian-White Integrated, the Asian Dominant, and the White Dominant groups. Between-groups differences on participants’ measures of cultural socialization, psychological distress, and internalized oppression were analyzed and compared. The Asian-White Integrated group reported more cultural socialization than the other 2 groups. Furthermore, Asian Dominant participants showed the highest levels of psychological distress, whereas White Dominant participants showed the highest levels of internalized oppression among all groups. The results lend empirical support to the study’s hypotheses and the M-HAPA model. Theoretical, conceptual, and methodological implications for future biracial identity research are discussed.

Abstract = {Presents a study which aims to examine the level of interactions which occurs between biracial students and others on the college campus and recommendations that biracial students offer for creating a welcoming inclusive college environment for biracial students. This exploratory study describes the level of interaction among mono-racial and bi/multiracial students on a large campus. Additionally, this study sought the input of bi/multiracial students on how colleges and universities can create a welcoming environment for this population. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are offered: 1. Colleges and universities must take definitive steps to provide supportive services and opportunities for bi/multiracial students including the creation of student organizations and activities for those who would benefit from these. 2. Recognition must be given to the fact that all biracial students do not hold the same attitudes and opinions related to their mixed race heritage, when making decisions about programming for biracial students. 3. Universities must provide opportunities to increase awareness and understanding of the biracial population among faculty, students, and staff through professional development workshops, trainings, college courses, and opportunities for open dialogues. 4. Steps must be taken to reduce the invisibility of multiracial people in the curriculum. 5. Universities must develop creative ways to increase the number of students who are exposed to courses on diversity and race relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that the 1980s was the decade of multiracial feminism, a period in which an explosion of writing and activism gave rise to a broader and more expansive feminism. This shift is frequently attributed to the outpouring of writing by women of color beginning in late 1979 as well as by white women writing about racism or oversight within the feminist movement. This conversation highlights some vital shifts that do indeed merit the characterization of the 1980s as "the decade of multiracial feminism"—but with a different emphasis than the original phrase suggests. But, as is frequently noted, the decade of the 1980s is distinctive in the sense that it brought about a conversation between women of color and white women over the meanings of feminism and who or what is feminist, increasing shifts toward a practice of multiracial feminism. It is in this decade that the phrase “women of color” comes to have real content. The writing of the 1980s focused even greater attention on the question of coalitions, interrogating the basis for assumed unity. Writing is a crucial mechanism for the expansion of feminist debates both because it creates a space for dialogue, communication, and contestation among women and because it enables us to track the contours of the debate over time. Feminist writings are critical to this analysis, for a focus on explicitly feminist organizations and prominent feminist activists may underemphasize the breadth of feminist commitment among unknown, or “ordinary,” women. Writing was also a mechanism of discursive intervention in the 1980s. This intervention was accomplished through an independent publishing strategy that allowed women of color to reach the widest possible audience, including the targeted women-of-color demographic. Publishing control allowed women of color to explore a number of themes that they found most relevant, especially coalition issues, history, and other minority feminist issues, including an increased attention to sexuality.

Abstract = {Microaggressions are subtle forms of discrimination, often unintentional and unconscious, which send negative and denigrating messages to various individuals and groups. Previous literature has focused on microaggressions of singular identities, with little attention to the impacts of intersectional microaggressions (i.e., subtle forms of discrimination that may be influenced by more than 1 identity). The current study utilized a unique qualitative technique to address 2 central goals: (a) to explore whether qualitative analysis is an effective way to examine intersectional microaggressions and (b) to examine whether people with multiple identities could identify intersectional microaggressions in their everyday lives. Utilizing Qualitative Secondary Analysis (QSA) and Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) methods, the researchers analyzed data from 6 previous qualitative studies with self-identified lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, women, Filipino Americans, multiracial people, and Muslims (N = 80). Sample themes include (a) Exoticization of Women of Color, (b) Disapproval of LGBT Identity by Racial, Ethnic, and Religious Groups, (c) Assumptions of Inferiority or Criminality of Men of Color, and (d) Gender-Based Stereotypes of Muslim Men and Women. Implications for psychology (particularly for research and practice) are discussed. Finally, the authors advocate for the use of secondary analysis of qualitative data, to understand concepts that would not have been studied or reported through a singular qualitative analysis.

Abstract = {Purpose: To assess the validity and reliability of the Malay version of the Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41) in Malaysia. Methods: The QUALEFFO-41 was translated from English to Malay and administered to 215 post-menopausal osteoporotic women ≥ 50 years who could understand Malay, at baseline and 4 weeks. The SF-36 was administered at baseline to assess convergent validity. To assess discriminative validity, patients with and without back pain were recruited. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the QUALEFFO-41 had five domains. Good internal consistency was seen in all domains (0.752–0.925) except for the social activity domain (0.692). Test–retest reliability showed adequate correlation for all items (0.752–0.964, p < 0.001). Patients with back pain had significantly worse QOL compared with those without (back pain = 42.2 ± 10.9, no back pain = 33.3 ± 8.9; p < 0.001). The total QUALEFFO-41 score and the SF-36 physical and mental composite scores were significantly correlated (−0.636 and −0.529, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: The Malay version of the QUALEFFO-41 was found to be a reliable and valid instrument to evaluate the QOL of osteoporotic patients in Malaysia. To enable the QUALEFFO-41 to be used in a multiracial population, further studies should look into validating other versions of the QUALEFFO-41 in Malaysia.

Abstract = {This study examined emotional reactivity to rejection and executive function (EF) skills as potential mediators of the social behavior problems of inattentive and hyperactive kindergarteners. Participants included 171 children, including 107 with clinical levels of ADHD symptoms, 23 with sub‐clinical levels of ADHD symptoms, and 41 typically developing children (63 percent male; 73 percent Caucasian, 11 percent African‐American, 4 percent Latino/Hispanic, 1 percent Asian, and 11 percent multiracial; Mage = 5.2 years). Inattention (but not hyperactivity) was uniquely associated with poor EF, social withdrawal, and aggression. In structural equation models, EF skills mediated the associations between inattention and both aggression and social withdrawal. Hyperactivity (but not inattention) was uniquely associated with rejection reactivity and each contributed uniquely to aggression. Findings suggest that difficulties with emotion regulation may warrant more attention in early interventions planned for children with high levels of ADHD symptoms.

Abstract = {Grounded in the theoretical frameworks of constructivism and social cognitive theory, this study examined utilising culturally responsive pedagogy through a Latino themed reading task with the intention of increasing reading achievement and reading self-efficacy beliefs for culturally and linguistically diverse students. The research was conducted in an urban middle school in the south-western United States with 43 seventh grade students whose age ranged from 12 to 13 years. The majority of participants in this study reported to be Hispanic or multiracial with Hispanic origins. This study’s findings added to the existing knowledge base regarding the effectiveness of culturally responsive teaching practices. More specifically, culturally responsive pedagogy was utilised in the form of a reading task to examine its influence on students’ recall and reading comprehension performance. Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest that a culturally familiar reading task may increase reading self-efficacy beliefs. Implications for primary and secondary teachers, administrators, parents, and students pertain to the importance of utilising culturally responsive pedagogy as a teaching method to increase reading achievement and reading self-efficacy for culturally and linguistically diverse students.

A review of 63 studies indicates that (1) the rates of IPV are generally similar across rural, urban, and suburban locales, although some groups of rural women (e.g., multiracial and separated/divorced) may be at increased risk for IPV compared to similar groups of urban women, and rates of intimate partner homicide may be higher in rural locales than urban and suburban locales; (2) IPV perpetrator and victim characteristics in rural locales are generally similar to IPV perpetrator and victim characteristics in other locales with the exception of some demographic characteristics that can generally be accounted for by broader rural–urban–suburban demographic differences; (3) IPV perpetrators in rural locales, compared with perpetrators in urban locales, may perpetrate more chronic and severe IPV, which could be due to the higher rates of substance abuse and unemployment documented among rural perpetrators; (4) IPV victims in rural locales may have worse psychosocial and physical health outcomes due to the lack of availability, accessibility, and quality of IPV services; and (5) attitudes about IPV vary to some extent across locales, with individuals in rural locales generally supporting less governmental involvement in IPV issues than in urban locales. Limitations of the literature are reviewed and suggestions for research are provided as well as implications for practice and policy efforts, which primarily center on improving availability, accessibility, and quality of IPV services in rural locales.

Abstract = {Introduction: Previous studies of health behaviors of adult cancer survivors have not adequately examined racial and ethnic differences because of small sample sizes. A national data set was used to examine differences in health behaviors between cancer survivors and controls and between racial and ethnic groups among survivors. Methods: The study analyzed 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey data in 2012–2014. Descriptive statistics were used to examine differences in health behaviors between cancer survivors and controls aged 20–64 years. Multivariable analysis was conducted to examine associations between race/ethnicity (white, African American, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American) and health behaviors (BMI, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and smoking status) while adjusting for demographic and medical characteristics. Significance was set at p < 0.01. Results: Compared with controls (n = 245,283), cancer survivors (n = 17,158) had higher prevalence rates for overweight/obese status (67% vs 65%); not meeting physical activity recommendations (53% vs 49%); and current smoking status (22% vs 20%). In the multivariable model, diet and smoking behavior differed across cancer status. African American (AOR = 1.95) and Hispanic (AOR = 2.06) survivors were more likely to have higher BMI than white survivors. African American survivors (AOR = 1.6) were less likely to meet physical activity guidelines. Native American (AOR = 3.08) and multiracial (AOR = 1.74) survivors were more likely to be current smokers than non-Hispanic white survivors. Conclusions: This study suggests that racial and ethnic differences exist in the adoption of recommended health behaviors; future research should identify factors to reduce these differences.

Abstract = {Most research on workplace harassment originates from European countries. Prevalence of workplace harassment and associated morbidity has not been well studied in the United States. The purpose of this study was to assess in a sample of US workers the prevalence of workplace harassment and the psychological and physical health consequences of workplace harassment. The 2010 National Health Interview Survey data were analyzed in 2014 for this study. We computed the prevalence of workplace harassment, assessed the demographic and background characteristics of victims of harassment, and tested the association between harassment and selected health risk factors by using logistic regression analysis. Statistical significance was established as p < 0.01. A total of 17,524 adults were included in our study (51.5 % females and 74.9 % Whites). A little <1 in 10 (8.1 %) reported being harassed in the workplace in the past 12 months. The odds of harassment were significantly higher for females (OR 1.47, p < 0.001),multiracial individuals (OR 2.30, p < 0.001), and divorced or separated individuals (OR 1.88, p < 0.001). Victims of harassment were significantly more likely to: be obese, sleep less, and smoke more. In addition, harassment was associated with psychosocial distress, pain disorders, work loss, bed days, and worsening health of employees in the past 12 months. Analysis was stratified by gender and distinct health risk patterns for men and women victims were observed. Workplace harassment in the US is associated with significant health risk factors and morbidity. Workplace policies and protocols can play a significant role in reducing harassment and the associated negative health outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Through qualitative in-depth interviews with multiracial and transracially adopted adults of African descent, this study seeks to raise awareness regarding the complexity of family racial dynamics and how family racial socialization processes affect students’ ability to navigate racism. Findings suggested that racial socialization processes varied by the racial composition of the family, that is, families in which there was at least one Black parent or guardian present tended to more openly address issues of race and racism in comparison with families in which there was no Black parent or guardian present. Findings from this study hold theoretical implications for how racial socialization is conceptualized and practical implications for programs and policies designed to support families raising children of African descent.

Abstract = {Aim: To characterize trends and clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors in 12–17-year-old non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black (NHB), Mexican-American (MA), and multiracial American (MRA) adolescents. Methods: Data from the 1999–2000 to 2007–2008 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were used for this investigation. Clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors was determined using cardiometabolic risk factor clustering score (cMetS) computed by aggregating z scores of mean arterial blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, waist circumference, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Results: There were significant increases in waist circumference and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and decreases in low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and mean arterial blood pressure in the 10-year period between 1999–2000 and 2007–2008. There were gender and racial/ethnic differences in cMetS, with NHB having a more favorable cMetS for each studied time point. Overall, cMetS decreased by 93% in the 10-year period between 1999–2000 and 2007–2008. cMetS decreased by 98% and 77.3% for male and female adolescents, respectively, in the period between 1999–2000 and 2007–2008. With the exception of Mexican-American and multiracial American female adolescents, all racial/ethnic groups had improved cMetS values on comparing mean cMetS values of 1999–2000 with mean values of 2007–2008. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, NHB male and female adolescents had the most improved cMetS. Conclusion: Because clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors is predictive of adult health status, early lifestyle intervention in adolescence may help slow down the progress and delay or prevent the onset of cardiovascular diseases in adulthood.

Abstract = {In this article, we examine a large, interdisciplinary, and somewhat scattered literature, all of which falls under the umbrella term race mixture. We highlight important analytical distinctions that need to be taken into account when addressing the related, but separate, social phenomena of intermarriage, miscegenation, multiracial identity, multiracial social movements, and race-mixture ideologies. In doing so, we stress a social constructivist approach to race mixture with a focus on boundary crossing. Finally, we also demonstrate how ideologies and practices of race mixture play out quite differently in contexts outside of the United States, particularly in Latin America. Race-mixture ideologies and practices in Latin America have been used to maintain racial inequality in the region, thus challenging recent arguments by U.S. scholars that greater racial mixture leads to a decline in racism, discrimination, and inequality.

Abstract = {Social groups are often described as hierarchically ordered in terms of social status. Intergroup research has generally focused on the relationship between the highest-status group and a single lower-status group, leaving relationships among nondominant groups relatively unexplored. Focusing on low-status Black and intermediate-status Coloured (multiracial) South African elementary school-children, we examined the attitudes members of these two groups hold toward one another and toward a range of other locally salient groups, as well as their wealth-related stereotypes and preferences. Results indicated that both Coloured and Black children implicitly preferred Coloured over Black, and also strongly associated Coloured (vs. Black) with wealth, suggesting a powerful tendency to internalize the status quo. However, Black children exhibited stronger preferences for other social groups, as well as stronger preferences for wealth in general, possibly as a means of compensating for their devalued status in the domain of race. Implications for theories of intergroup attitudes are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the history of multiracial American Japanese who grew up in Okinawa and the US during the post-World War II period through the 1970s. The author contextualize their lives historically and document them with oral history interviews focusing on people who grew up in Okinawa. Their transnational lives provide insight on the human experience of multiraciality. The reason for focusing on Okinawa is twofold: the first because of Okinawa's status as a repeatedly colonized space, by Japan in 1879, and later by the US from 1945 to 1972; and secondly on the basis as a place where a "third space" hybrid culture exists for mixed-race people as a result of the long term US military presence." It is important to study this age group for several reasons. First, many of them have a more concrete sense of their own identity than people who are in their teens or twenties. Second, in the academic literature on multiracial people following World War II, their voices are largely absent while the focus is on their parents, caretakers, or adoptive parents. Third, beginning with occupied Japan as a birthplace for mixed people who embody a third culture in a semi-colonized space, and later looking at this group as American immigrants, the research offers new openings for discussion about the current models of racial formation of mixed and marginalized people and how race is reinforced historically across borders.

Abstract = {Multiracials have the flexibility to opt out of multiracial identity, to shift identities depending on context, and are characterized by in-group diversity. Given this fluid space, how do multiracials come to see themselves as a collective? This article describes an empirical example of collectivization processes at work. Specifically, the author observed the process of collective identity-building through ethnographic research in a mixed-race student-run organization. This case study indicates that group identity formation is a negotiated process involving strategies to achieve a sense of belonging and cohesion. The author shows that over time, by using experiences of social conflict to construct shared experiences, the members of this mixed-race organization developed collective identity. In so doing, their experience underscores how collective identity development is socially constructed and how micropractices are essential components of group formation.

Abstract = {The term multiracial is complex. Recent research has adopted a multidimensional view initially proposed by Rockquemore and colleagues (2002, 2009) for examining racial identity among Black/White biracial people. This approach has acknowledged the social construction of race and broadened the range of racial identity options beyond the two “traditional” options of being “Black” or “biracial.” This study was designed to further assess this framework by examining a more diverse multiracial sample from Canada and the U.S. (N = 122). Both the Black/White biracials (n = 38) and Asian/White biracials (n = 40) showed great variability in their selection of Rockquemore's multiracial identity categories, but the pattern of responses differed across the two groups. In addition to revealing different patterns of identity selection between Asian/White and Black/White biracial persons, findings demonstrated the importance of identity validation by others and its relation to conceptions of the self. Having a multiracial identity that is validated by others (as opposed to invalidated or contextually dependent identities) was associated with higher levels of identity integration and self-concept clarity. Theoretical implications for extending a multidimensional model to other biracial groups are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Among American Indians and Alaska Natives, most aspects of ethnicity are tightly associated with the person's tribal origins. Language, history, foods, land and traditions differ among the hundreds of tribes indigenous to the USA. With this in mind, we ask why almost one million American Indians failed to respond to the tribal affiliation part of the Census 2000 race question. We investigate four hypotheses about why one-third of multiracial American Indians and one-sixth of single-race American Indians did not write any response to the tribal affiliation question: (1) survey item non-response that undermines all fill-in-the-blank questions; (2) a non-salient tribal identity; (3) a genealogy-based affiliation; and (4) a mestizo identity, which does not require a tribe. We use multivariate logistic regression models and high-density restricted-use Census 2000 data. We find support for the first two hypotheses and note that predictors differ substantially for single-race versus multiple-race American Indians.

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify demographic characteristics and correlates of the uptake of HIV testing, willingness to be tested and perceived HIV-related stigma of Malaysian lay public. A cross-sectional computer-assisted telephone interview survey of a representative sample of multiracial Malaysians aged 18 years and above was conducted between December and July 2011. The survey collected information on demographics, knowledge about HIV transmission and religious beliefs on attitudes to HIV/AIDS. A total of 2271 households were successfully interviewed. The response rate was 48.65%. The HIV transmission knowledge score ranged from 0 to 15 (mean = 10.56; SD ± 2.42). Three of the most common misconceptions about HIV transmission were mosquito bite (42.8%), eating in a restaurant where the cook is HIV positive (20.4%) and using a public toilet (20.1%). Only 20.6% reported ever having been tested for HIV, 49.1% reported a willingness to be tested for HIV and 30.3% had no intention of getting an HIV test. Low-risk perception (63.7%) constitutes a major barrier to HIV testing. Being Malay and Chinese (relative to Indian) were the strongest predictors of low-risk perception. Other significant predictors of low-risk perception were being male, being married and living in an urban locality. Perceived self-stigma if tested positive for HIV was prevalent (78.8%). Multivariate findings showed that being female, Malay, low income, living in rural localities and public stigma were significant correlates of self-stigma. These findings warrant interventions to reduce the disproportionate HIV transmission misconception, barriers to HIV testing and stigma and discriminative attitudes to involve considerations of sociocultural economic and demographic characteristics.

I suggest there are three views for assessing racial democracy in scholarly literature: achieved Brazil is a multiracial non-racist society; oppressive Brazil is a racist society with strained interracial relations; and aspirational Brazil is a multiracial racist society that aspires to be non-racist. I then argue that exposure to US racial ideals via migration influences Brazilians' perceptions of racial democracy. I demonstrate this using interviews with forty-nine Brazilians who migrated to the USA and returned to Brazil and twenty-four non-migrants who did not migrate, in Governador Valadares, Brazil. My findings indicate that more returnees and non-migrants perceive Brazil as a multiracial racist country, which is consistent with the aspirational view of racial democracy.

Abstract = {Transgender individuals experience harassment, violence, and discrimination in a number of settings. Although health care discrimination against transgender people has been documented, this issue is understudied. Using a national cross-sectional survey data set (N = 1,711), the authors sought to determine how gender identity and presentation predict health care discrimination experiences among female-to-male (FTM) transgender people after demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are controlled. Analyses were conducted using chi-square tests and a two-step logistic regression. The majority of participants were white (73.9 percent) and between 25 and 44 years old (65.2 percent). Overall, 41.8 percent of FTM participants reported verbal harassment, physical assault, or denial of equal treatment in a doctor’s office or hospital. When other factors were controlled, being Native American or multiracial, identifying as queer or asexual/other, having a graduate degree, living full-time as nonbirth gender, using hormones or surgery for medical transition, and having identification documents that list one’s preferred gender were associated with increased reporting of health care discrimination experiences; being 45 years or older and reporting an annual income of $60,000 or more were associated with decreased risk. The study’s findings can be useful to social workers, who play a role in educating health care providers and advocating for policies that improve health care experiences for FTM and other transgender patients.

In both BioWare series, the player is set on a course to manage ethnic bodies into a racially determined division of labor (as military force), assuming the neutral position of a “multiculturalist umpire.” I investigate Mass Effect’s loyalty mechanic and its genre mixture of the role-playing game with the military shooter to consider how BioWare’s signature emphasis on team cooperation and supporting characters can express meanings that value American multiculturalism as exceptional, thus permitting forms of patriarchal and imperial violence to continue unabated. Finally, I consider how the player’s choice to play as female rather than male can shift the player’s experience from an imperialist attitude toward one of multiracial coalition that focuses on structures of patriarchal power and reproductive control.

However, less information is available regarding how these factors may impact PTSD symptoms in maltreated youth in particular. The present study examined the relationship between (1) negative posttraumatic cognitions, dissociation, and depression and (2) posttraumatic symptom levels in maltreated youth via structural equation modeling. Further modeling was examined across IQ level, gender, age, ethnicity, and maltreatment type. Participants (n = 360) included maltreated youth from Department of Family Services-related sites. Negative posttraumatic cognitions, dissociation, and depression were associated with heightened posttraumatic symptoms. Model fit remained best with respect to age group (older youth), ethnicity (African American and multiracial status), and maltreatment type (sexual maltreatment and neglect), but varied little across IQ and gender. Specific individual characteristics may thus exacerbate risk for PTSD symptoms in maltreated youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: The U.S. infant mortality rate is the highest in the developed world, and disparity impacts underserved populations. Traditional maternal health focuses on women, excluding men from information affecting family health. Scholars advocate including men in prenatal health to reduce infant mortality, a proven strategy in developing nations. This study explored the role of U.S. men in prenatal health, barriers to involvement, and the use of e-health. Special attention was given to health literacy; research indicates e-health is effective in educating low health-literate audiences. Materials and Methods: This study interviewed men with an average age of 33 years (n = 32). The sample was 38% Hispanic, 28% African American, 28% white, and 6% multiracial. Participants were asked about pregnancy health and used a pregnancy-related e-health application on a tablet computer. Participants provided opinions on content, ease of use of the tablet, and willingness to use similar applications. Results: Men believe it is important to be involved in pregnancy to help ensure healthy births. Most use mobile devices and computers for health information and found the application to be useful and interesting. Most concluded they would use a similar application to learn about pregnancy. Health literacy had minimal impact on participants’ use of the tablet and information. Conclusions: This study explored the role men play in prenatal health, a promising avenue toward better birth outcomes. Using e-health is an opportune approach—it can reach men unavailable to attend prenatal programs because of work or feeling unwelcome at programs deemed "only for women."

Findings in this exploratory study indicate that states and metropolitan areas with more fragmented district structures are associated with higher levels of segregation. In comparison with the less fragmented states of North Carolina and Virginia, in the highly fragmented states of New York and New Jersey, the typical black and Latino student are exposed to smaller shares of white students, the typical white student is more isolated with other white peers, there are greater disparities in exposure to low-income students by race, the share of non-white segregated schools is substantially larger, and levels of multiracial unevenness are higher. (These states were selected from a set of in-depth state studies by the Civil Rights Project of the states from Maine to North Carolina; comparable data are not available for many other states.) Highly fragmented states and metropolitan areas with numerous small school districts cannot confront segregation by exclusively focusing their efforts within districts; in these areas, segregation is fundamentally occurring among districts rather than within districts. Instead, highly fragmented areas could use regional strategies, such as interdistrict transfer programs, regional magnet schools, and district consolidation, to make progress in desegregating their schools across school district lines.

Abstract = {Multiracial families and individuals have had a history of oppression and discrimination in the United States, which has resulted in mental health care needs to promote family cohesion and identity development. This chapter has four main themes that address these issues and needs. First, is the history of discrimination toward multiracial families and individuals. The United States has had a long history of legislation against interracial unions from the first antimiscegenation laws of the 1600s to the Supreme Court ruling on the Loving v. Virginia case of 1967. As late as 1998 and 2000, South Carolina and Alabama had antimiscegenation laws on their state law books, although not enforced. Second, multiracial families and individuals still face many barriers in today's society. These include continued lack of acceptance by families and society, stigma, and a plethora of myths such as marrying for increased social status or selling out to multiracial individuals lacking self-esteem and a healthy self-identity. Third, several stage theories have emerged to help understand family and individual development over the life span. Foeman and Nance developed a four-stage model to gain better insight into the developmental process of multiracial relationships. Several models of identity development of individuals have emerged from more marginal or deficit-oriented models to recent models that promote a more positive developmental process. One such model is a six-stage model from Kerwin and Ponterotto. Fourth, intervention models have been proposed to support development of multiracial families and individuals. Ecological approaches are helpful to look at family systems and social supports within the community. Empowerment approaches are helpful for multiracial families and individuals to take more control of their lives through education and consciousness raising. Finally, strengths approaches seek to normalize experiences and enhance factors that support families and individuals to overcome racism and adversity.

Abstract = {Despite the often cited idea that racial identities are socially constructed, and potentially fluid, much public policy is still based on surveys that elicit only one measure of racial identity. A number of U.S. studies have employed “best single race” questions on racial identification, in which multiracial respondents are asked to choose only one race to describe themselves. We extend some American studies by examining responses to a “best single race” survey question posed to a small sample of multiracial young people in Britain. In-depth interviews with British multiracial respondents are employed to investigate the extent to which a “best single race” (BSR) question captures someone’s sense of attachment and belonging to a particular ethnic or racial group. In particular, we focus on how we should interpret East Asian/white respondents’ choice of “white” as their BSR. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {There is a growing number of mixed-race people in the United States and a growing number of individuals who identify as mixed-race or multiracial. In the last census, 6.8 million people identified as multiracial, marking more than one racial category to identify themselves or their children, with 42 percent under 18 years of age (Jones & Symens Smith, 2001). The "biracial baby boom" of the 1970s and 1980s produced a notable cohort of multiracial individuals (Bratter, 2007) and resulted in an increase in the number of mixed-race individuals from 500,000 in 1970 to nearly 7 million in 2000 (Krebs, 2000; Shih & Sanchez, 2005). Given this growing population, mental health practitioners will likely be working with increasing numbers of multiracial individuals (Kerwin, Ponterotto, Jackson, & Harris, 1993); thus, it is important for therapists and counselors to have an awareness and knowledge of the experiences of this population and to be able to transfer this awareness and knowledge into skills useful in working with multiracial individuals. Competent, ethical multicultural practice requires understanding and addressing the unique characteristics and mental health needs of this population. This chapter will provide the reader with guidelines and resources for increasing awareness of one's own values and attitudes, knowledge of ecological issues related to people of mixed ancestry, and skills in developing competency in working with persons of mixed ancestry. Case studies are included and will be referred to throughout the chapter to illustrate critical concepts. Pouse & Ponder exercises will be included throughout the chapter to prompt the reader to stop, reflect, and engage in a more contemplative and dynamic way with the concepts in this text, thus increasing personal awareness and recognition of multicultural issues as they relate to people of mixed ancestry (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study estimates the prevalence of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use in a nationally representative sample of monoracial/ethnic and biracial/ethnic youth and young adults. The authors consider 16 racial/ethnic categories and used four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The analysis sample consists of 20,745 individuals in Wave 1. The primary statistical methodology used in the present study is logistic regression with sample weights. Findings suggest that participants who self-report two races/ethnicities have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates. For example, Black-American Indians reported cigarette smoking rates that were significantly lower than rates reported by American Indians but significantly higher than rates reported by Blacks. Groups with the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking at Wave 1 were American Indian, White-American Indian, White, and Multiracial (people reporting three or more races/ethnicities). Groups with the highest prevalence of alcohol drinking at Wave 1 were White-American Indian, Multiracial, Hispanic, White, and White-Hispanic. Groups with the highest prevalence of marijuana smoking at Wave 1 were Black-Asian and American Indian. The authors found an interaction effect between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Lower-class SES status may serve as a risk factor for biracial/ethnic adolescents while upper-class SES may serve as a protective factor for these youth. In general, biracial/ethnic individuals have prevalence rates that are intermediate to those of the two corresponding monoracial/ethnic rates.

Abstract = {Parents’ emotion coaching of children and modeling of effective emotional responses are associated with children’s positive emotional development. However, much of the research in this area has been with European American families. This study examined parents’ self-reports about their emotion regulation patterns and coaching their children about emotions, across three racial and ethnic groups (African American, European American, and Multiracial), to determine how well these parental behaviors predicted their children’s self-reports of depressive and anxiety symptoms 18 to 24 months later (N = 99). For the African American families, a higher level of coaching about anger and sadness by mothers was linked with lower depressive symptoms in their children. A higher level of anger coaching by fathers within the Multiracial group was also associated with lower anxiety and depressive symptoms. This study supports the importance of cultural values, within racial and ethnic groups, in parenting approaches associated with children’s mental health outcomes.

Abstract = {This article examines a selection of the North American scholarly research that calls for “moving beyond” a “Black/White binary paradigm.” Some scholars suggest this paradigm limits or obscures a complex understanding of the historical record on race, racism, and racialization for Asian, Latina/o, Mexican, and Native Americans. On the face of it, the notion of a Black/White binary paradigm and the call to move beyond appears persuasive. The discourse of a Black/White binary paradigm, however, confuses, misnames, and simplifies the historical and contemporary experiences structured within what is, in fact, the racially incorporative matrix of a black/white Manicheanism. We assert this call sets up blackness and, by extension, people socially defined as “black” as impediments to multiracial coalition building. As a result, “moving beyond” is epistemologically faulty and politically harmful for African- descended people because it is based on “bad faith” toward blackness.

Using a social psychological approach, Choudhry investigated the experience and identity construction of interethnic adolescents in Britain. By focusing primarily on Asian-White interethnic adolescents, the author made a significant contribution to existent, albeit limited, scholarship on this growing subgroup of the British multiracial population. The author's findings on British interethnic youth's identification corroborate those of studies on U.S. multiracial youth. In accord with growing U.S. research evidence, Choudhry's investigation suggests that while some British interethnic youth identify with a single race, others embrace a multiracial identity. Choudhry's work underscores the significance of family and physical appearance for Asian-White interethnic youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

The research reported by Gupta and colleagues describes an epidemiological approach to brain science that links brain differences to behavioral differences in a large-scale multiracial/ ethnic sample. The size and scope of the study was an impressive accomplishment because neuroimaging thousands of individuals is time-consuming, expensive, and fraught with methodological challenges. However, such research offers an opportunity to consider how differences in multiple markers of brain structure or function may be associated with variations in human cognition. Although the study by Gupta et al emphasizes that the visuospatial domain of cognition had the most significant associations across brain volume markers, the strength of the associations was largely not different across domains. It is important to recognize that cross-sectional data cannot provide information on the direction of the relationship between brain markers and cognition.

Abstract = {Objective: Little smoking research in the past 20 years includes persons 50 and older; herein we describe patterns of clinician cessation advice to US seniors, including variation by Medicare beneficiary characteristics. Method: In 2012–4, we analyzed 2010 Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey data from Medicare beneficiaries over age 64 (n = 346,674). We estimated smoking rates and the proportion of smokers whose clinicians encouraged cessation. Results: 12% of male and 8% of female respondents aged 65 and older smoke. The rate decreases with age (14% of 65–69, 3% of 85+) and education (12–15% with no high school degree, 5–6% with BA+). Rates are highest among American Indian/Alaskan Native (16%), multiracial (14%), and African–American (13%) seniors, and in the Southeast (14%). Only 51% of smokers say they receive cessation advice “always” or “usually” at doctor visits, with advice more often given to the young, those in low-smoking regions, Asians, and women. For all results cited p < 0.05. Conclusions: Smoking cessation advice to seniors is variable. Providers may focus on groups or areas in which smoking is less common or when they are most comfortable giving advice. More consistent interventions are needed, including cessation advice from clinicians. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine a model of the relationships between parenting deficits and skills, along with child outcomes, in a sample of mothers living with HIV (MLH) and their 6- to 14-year-old children. Sixty-two MLH (61% Latina, 26% black, 3% white, and 10% multiracial) and their well children (age 6–14) were recruited from the greater Los Angeles, California, region to participate in an intervention (IMAGE: Improving Mothers’ parenting Abilities, Growth, and Effectiveness) designed to assist MLH with parenting and self-care skills. Constructs examined included parenting deficits, parenting skills, and child outcomes. Covariance structural modeling was used for the analyses. Covariance structural modeling confirmed the hypothesized set of construct associations. As predicted, fewer parenting deficits were associated with better parenting skills, which, in turn, were associated with better child outcomes. This study delineated further the parenting issues with which MLH struggle, providing information on the interventions needed for this population. MLH who have little confidence they can enact parenting skills and limited knowledge of basic parenting practices appear to be less likely to provide family routines consistently, monitor their children, or to engender family cohesion or a close parent–child relationship. Such parenting skills were found to be associated with child functioning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Categorization plays a fundamental role in organizing daily interactions with the social world. However, there is increasing recognition that social categorization is often complex, both because category membership can be ambiguous (e.g., multiracial or transgender identities) and because different categorical identities (e.g., race and gender) may interact to determine the meaning of category membership. These complex identities simultaneously impact social perceivers’ impressions and social targets’ own experiences of identity, thereby shaping perceptions, experiences, and interactions in fundamental ways. This review examines recent research on the perception and experience of the complex, multifaceted identities that both complicate and enrich our lives. Although research has historically tended to focus more on difficulties and challenges associated with multiple identities, increasing attention is being paid to opportunities that emerge from the possession of identities that include multiple distinct or overlapping groups. We consider how these opportunities might benefit both perceivers and targets. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The present study examined the relationship of rumination and depression to deficits in executive functions in early adolescence, a critical developmental period for the emergence of depression and rumination and the development of executive functions. Participants were 486 early adolescents (52.7 % female; 47.1 % African American, 48.8 % Caucasian; 4.2 % Biracial/Multiracial/Other; M age = 12.88 years; SD = .62) and their mothers, recruited through local schools. Measures included (a) a semi-structured diagnostic interview of the mother and adolescent, (b) youth self-report forms assessing depressive symptoms and trait rumination, (c) mother-report forms assessing demographic information, and (d) behavioral tests of executive function (sustained, selective and divided attention, attentional set shifting, and working memory). Gender moderated rumination-set shifting associations, such that rumination predicted better set shifting in boys only. The current level of depressive symptoms moderated rumination-sustained attention associations, such that rumination predicted better sustained attention in those with low levels of depressive symptoms and worse sustained attention in those with high levels of depressive symptoms. Rumination did not predict performance on other measures of executive functions. Likewise, depressive symptoms and diagnosis were not associated with executive functions.

Abstract = {Purpose: A newly emergent literature suggests that bisexual men and women face profound health disparities in comparison to both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Additionally, bisexual individuals often experience prejudice, stigma, and discrimination from both gay/lesbian and straight communities, termed "biphobia." However, only limited research exists that empirically tests the extent and predictors of this double discrimination. The Bisexualities: Indiana Attitudes Scale (BIAS) was developed to test associations between biphobia and sexual identity. Methods: Using standard techniques, we developed and administered a scale to a purposive online sample of adults from a wide range of social networking websites. We conducted exploratory factor analysis to refine scales assessing attitudes toward bisexual men and bisexual women, respectively. Using generalized linear modeling, we assessed relationships between BIAS scores and sexual identity, adjusting for covariates. Results: Two separately gendered scales were developed, administered, and refined: BIAS-m (n = 645), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual men, and BIAS-f (n = 631), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual women. Across scales, sexual identity significantly predicted response variance. Lesbian/gay respondents had lower levels of binegative attitudes than their heterosexual counterparts (all p-values < .05); bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their straight counterparts (all p-values < .001); and bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their lesbian/gay counterparts (all p-values < .05).Within racial/ethnic minority respondents, biracial/multiracial status was associated with lower bi-negativity scores (all p-values < .05). Conclusions: This study provides important quantitative support for theories related to biphobia and double discrimination. Our findings provide strong evidence for understanding how stereotypes and stigma may lead to dramatic disparities in depression, anxiety, stress, and other health outcomes among bisexual individuals in comparison to their heterosexual and homosexual counterparts. Our results yield valuable data for informing social awareness and intervention efforts that aim to decrease bi-negative attitudes within both straight and gay/lesbian communities, with the ultimate goal of alleviating health disparities among bisexual men and women.

Abstract = {For most Latino youth, Latinos constitute a separate, while diverse, racial group. Our study demonstrates that, when asked about their identities, Latino youth do not follow conventional U.S. racial categories. Although they prefer to identify by national origin or panethnicity, they consider themselves to be part of a racial group rather than an ethnic group, as the U.S. Census designates them. Using findings from in-depth semistructured interviews with two samples of young adults in Chicago and Central Florida, this research joins the long-standing debate on the conceptual division between race and ethnicity arguing that there is a mismatch between existing sociological understandings of race and ethnicity and the current racial ideas and racial practices among Latino youth. There is also a mismatch between institutional measures of “race,” such as those found in the U.S. Census, and Latinos’ self-understandings of where they belong in the U.S. racial hierarchy. We suggest that not being officially designated as a racial group leads to the erosion of perceptions of belonging among Latinos to a nation in which being a member of a racial group allows for visibility and claims-making in a multiracial society.

Abstract = {Analysis of interview data illustrates how White adoptive parents rationalize choices regarding adoptee race. Parents who were willing to adopt children of color stressed unwillingness to adopt Black children. The preference for adopting multiracial children goes against the prevalent method of racial classification, hypodescent, by defining multiracial as distinct from Black, assuming that multiracial children would not experience racism. Those who adopted children of color also relied on racial classifications of hypodescent and challenged color-blind ideology by recognizing the importance of race. They also defined race in terms of perceived race versus birth parent racial identity. Findings have implications for how agencies, social workers, and counselors portray various groups as well as prepare, counsel, and support adoptive and multiracial families.

The present studies investigated whether 3‐ to 10‐year‐old children (N = 84) in South Africa associate higher status racial groups with higher levels of wealth, one indicator of social status. Children matched higher value belongings with White people more often than with multiracial or Black people and with multiracial people more often than with Black people, thus showing sensitivity to the de facto racial hierarchy in their society. There were no age‐related changes in children’s tendency to associate racial groups with wealth differences. The implications of these results are discussed in light of the general tendency for people to legitimize and perpetuate the status quo. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Molefi Kete Asante is one of the most important scholars in the field of communication studies in the late twentieth century. His general interests range from intercultural communication, rhetoric, media and public communication to Africana studies. He has taught at several universities, led several organizations and is recognized as a leader within the communication discipline and in the broader national and global society; especially within Africa and the African diaspora. Asante is credited with the development and eventual emergence of what is referred to as the Afrocentric Idea, a theoretical perspective focusing on the agency of African peoples. Asante’s groundbreaking work in the 1970s and 1980s would foreshadow and frame many of the debates of not only communication studies, but in the fields of education, sociology, literary, and cultural studies, as well as history from the 1990s and early twenty first century. The current article focuses on Asante’s important contributions to intercultural communication in the areas of rhetoric, media and public communication, Africana Studies, and intercultural/interracial communication. Asante’s emergence corresponded with the American multiracial struggle against domestic racism and segregation; and the international fight against imperialism and advanced stages of colonialism. Many of Asante’s ideas reflect the spirit of the 1955 Bandung conference that helped launch intellectual and political opposition to oppression by people of color.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine racial/ethnic disparities in medical and oral health status, access to care, and use of services in U.S. adolescents. Data Source: Secondary data analysis of the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health. The survey focus was children 0–17 years old. Study Design: Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted for white, African American, Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and multiracial adolescents 10–17 years old (n = 48,742) to identify disparities in 40 measures of health and health care. Principal Findings: Certain disparities were especially marked for specific racial/ethnic groups and multiracial youth. These disparities included suboptimal health status and lack of a personal doctor or nurse for Latinos; suboptimal oral health and not receiving all needed medications in the past year for African Americans; no physician visit or mental health care in the past year for Asian/Pacific Islanders; overweight/obesity, uninsurance, problems getting specialty care, and no routine preventive visit in the past year for American Indian/Alaska Natives; and not receiving all needed dental care in multiracial youth. Conclusions: U.S. adolescents experience many racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. These findings indicate a need for ongoing identification and monitoring of and interventions for disparities for all five major racial/ethnic groups and multiracial adolescents.

Abstract = {The authors examined the link between malleable racial identification and psychological well-being among self-identified multiracial adults. Malleable racial identification refers to the tendency to identify with different racial identities across different social contexts. Results across three studies suggested that malleable racial identification was associated with lower psychological well-being. Study 2 found that unstable regard (i.e., fluctuating private regard about their multiracial background) was the mechanism through which malleable racial identification predicted lower psychological health. Results of Study 3 suggested that dialectical self-views played an important moderating role that determines whether malleability is associated with negative psychological outcomes. The present studies uniquely show that malleable racial identification among multiracial people is maladaptive for psychological health, but that this may depend on whether or not people have tolerance for ambiguity and inconsistency in the self.

Abstract = {Juan sits at the intersection of multiple worlds. He is a gay man and a person of color with working-class roots living in the United States, and his race and sexual orientation certainly have been devalued or denigrated at various points throughout his life. Moreover, as a biracial person, particularly as a child of parents from two different racial minority groups, Juan most likely has been marginalized even within his own racial-ethnic communities, perhaps rendered invisible because he does not "fit" clearly into a specific group, including his own family. These challenges to his identities further may be contextualized within his current developmental, family, and career struggles. Moreover, although gay men, people of color, and biracial and multiracial people are marginalized in the larger society, it is important to view the sources of strength that Juan may derive from these identities. In this chapter, we will discuss counseling issues specific to working with LGB people and biracial and multiracial people, integrating Juan's presenting concerns to provide examples. Because it will be optimal to employ a myriad of culturally responsive theoretical orientations when working with Juan, we have chosen to work from a feminist relational perspective, embedded in LGB affirmative and multicultural competence frameworks. Although all clients can benefit from a feminist relational perspective, we believe this approach to be particularly relevant to Juan, who is facing multiple challenges in part because of his identity as a biracial (Filipino and Black) gay man, perhaps from working-class or working-poor roots. In addition, from what he describes, he is facing challenges in his relationships with family members and perhaps with friends and his partner. In the next sections, we will define our theoretical frameworks applied to the case of Juan. Throughout the chapter, we will integrate relevant information from the evidence-based practice literature in addressing the anxiety symptoms that Juan presents, bearing in mind that there is a dearth of research on how these techniques apply to individuals from nondominant groups.

Abstract = {The multiple heritage adult shares many issues and experiences with people in this population who are at other developmental levels. Unfortunately, research with multiple heritage adults is quite limited compared to research with children, adolescents, and families. One particular difference is that multiple heritage adults have lived much longer with their experiences and the impact of those experiences. That is, the multiple heritage adult may have several memories of his or her identity development derived from childhood and adolescent environments (McClain, 2004), initial dating experiences, familial reactions, and college experiences (if he or she attended college). For example, "multiracial adults who come for counseling often tell of painful memories of being teased or ostracized when they were younger" (Wehrly, Kenney, & Kenney, 1999, p. 61). These memories have the potential to affect the current functions and definitions of a person's current identity (e.g., the case of Roger). Derrick A. Paladino is quite aware of the shifts and changes he made as a child moving through different racial and culture identities to feel safe in certain social situations. As an adult, even though he currently identifies himself as multiracial and not with divided identities, he is still aware of this past as he enters new situations. In this chapter, we attempt to explore the nature of the multiple heritage adult as well as offer counseling suggestions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {The high-stakes nature of law school testing and admissions puts a premium on the student data presented to admissions committees, such as essays, academic and work history, and student background characteristics including race/ethnicity. 4,472 law school-bound students self-identified their race/ethnicity using (a) a mutually exclusive "choose one" format during registration for the law school admissions test, and (b) an elaborated "check-all-that-apply" format as part of a national survey administered during the first weeks at their chosen law school. Student multiraciality that was masked by the first assessment was associated with self-reported ethnic identity, discrimination experience, intergroup contact, race-related attitudes, academic performance, and trait ratings, as compared to monoracial majority students. A different profile of findings was observed across these constructs when multiracial students were compared to monoracial majority students, to monoracial minority students, and within group. These correlates also predicted the likelihood of changing identification across the two assessment contexts. These findings support the continued study of specific combinations of multiracial groups, fluidity of multiracial identities, and context effects that influence race/ethnicity self-categorizations.

Abstract = {Historically, the principle of hypodescent specified that individuals with one Black and one White parent should be considered Black. Two experiments examined whether categorizations of racially ambiguous targets reflect this principle. Participants studied ambiguous target faces accompanied by profiles that either did or did not identify the targets as having multiracial backgrounds (biological, cultural, or both biological and cultural). Participants then completed a speeded dual-categorization task requiring Black/not Black and White/not White judgments (Experiments 1 and 2) and deliberate categorization tasks requiring participants to describe the races (Experiment 2) of target faces. When a target was known to have mixed-race ancestry, participants were more likely to rapidly categorize the target as Black (and not White); however, the same cues also increased deliberate categorizations of the targets as "multiracial." These findings suggest that hypodescent still characterizes the automatic racial categorizations of many perceivers, although more complex racial identities may be acknowledged upon more thoughtful reflection.

Regression analyses demonstrated prospective relations between negative mother representation and less inhibitory control, negative child representation and higher aggression, and narrative coherence and more inhibitory control. Interactive analyses revealed relations between negative mother representation and difficulties in inhibitory control among White children and weaker relations among Black children. Prospective relations between narrative coherence and increased inhibitory control were less pronounced for Hispanic children. Findings indicate that preschoolers’ narratives can reveal the thematic content and structural coherence of their internalized beliefs and expectations of self and (m)other.

Using hierarchical multiple regression analyses and the Johnson–Neyman technique, it was hypothesized that parents’ color-blind attitudes would significantly account for 3 different dimensions of socialization beliefs (i.e., prejudice awareness, ethnic pride, and egalitarian socialization) and that self-reported cross-racial friendships would moderate the effects of color-blind attitudes. Results suggest that having several cross-racial friendships minimized the effects of participants’ color-blind attitudes on their ethnic pride and egalitarian socialization beliefs, whereas having few cross-racial friendships enhanced the effects of color-blind attitudes on both socialization variables.

Abstract = {There is relatively little research to explain why diverse groups of employees often experience negative workplace events (Cox & Nkomo, 1990). In addition, most studies of discrimination and harassment tend to limit their focus to one minority group at a time and do not consider multiple forms of diversity--reflecting, for example, racioethnicity, gender, disability, age, and sexual orientation. To rectify this oversight, we introduce in this chapter the concept of "multiple minority status" and propose that belonging to more than one minority group simultaneously--in other words, having multiple minority identities--will have a significant impact on the work experiences of minorities. As of yet, there has been little research done in this area. However, based on research suggesting that minority group members experience a host of negative physical, psychological, and job-related outcomes, we expect that being a multiple minority will further increase the likelihood of experiencing these negative outcomes. In this chapter, we also consider the critical role that the organizational diversity climate can play in the workplace experiences of employees. Because of the challenges brought about by today's rapidly changing workforce, organizations need to focus on monitoring their climates for diversity, in addition to the typical focus on modifying individual employee behavior via diversity-training initiatives. A second goal of this chapter is to present a tool, which can provide a comprehensive assessment of organizational diversity climate that takes into account gender, age, race/ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation.

Abstract = {This chapter utilizes a cross-disciplinary approach to the issue of immigrants and the mental health profession in two parts. First, it briefly surveys studies on, and issues of, immigration and immigrants from both national and international perspectives, including the immigrant's unique experience in this society, which presents both similarities to and differences from both domestic and racial minorities. The second part proposes that to integrate the newcomers into this society, public policies that promote multiculturalism and integration must be established and activated from government levels. This chapter identifies three major factors that contribute to the failure of the mental health system in serving immigrants' needs. The "silo state" of the current mental health system is oppressive to the newcomers, more so than to the general consumers of mental health services. The Eurocentric values of the American mental health professions conflict with the cultural values of many immigrants, and the etic (culturally universal) approach to mental health by professionals on the individual level constitutes the major force that keeps mental health services out of the reach of immigrants. To work with immigrants, to improve their general wellness and mental health, the mental health systems and their constituent professionals must make a paradigm shift in their views and in their orientations. This shift will require systemic, structural changes that necessitate cross-disciplinary, preventive means of meeting the mental health needs of immigrants.

Abstract = {Immigrant children and their first-generation parents face numerous developmental tasks that are disregarded by major psychological developmental theories. They face a daunting task of trying to sort out who they are in the midst of very contradictory messages and situations. They try to maintain cultural allegiances for their parents' sake, while at the same time they are being pushed by their mainstream peers to accept mainstream discourses and deny their backgrounds. Part of this is a result of an acculturation force that teaches people to embrace a country and its traditions. However, there are other factors that permeate everyday interactions. The notion of acculturation, while useful in understanding immigrants' mental health, is archaic in its linear conceptualization. Issues of ethnic identity development are as important in the immigrant's mental health as are the notions of racism and discrimination. In studying the development of ethnic identity and acculturation, it is imperative to address not only the individual variables, such as age, gender, and class, but also the mainstream's social status given to a particular race (for example, Asian versus black, where it is clear that whites tend to marry more Asians than blacks, or the stereotype that Asians are smarter than Latinos and blacks). Also, it is important to address the pressure to conform imposed by the majority group, and its implications for a person's livelihood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In this chapter, we describe our process and work with the Hmong in Minnesota in overcoming language discrimination in mental health. While other cultures experience similar language discrimination, the complexities of Hmong language make this a unique challenge. By offering our process, our application of cultural semantics, and the guidelines for the use of interpreters we developed as a model for overcoming language discrimination in mental health, we hope that our efforts will help other culture groups that face similar challenges. In the first section of this chapter, "Bridging Non-English-English Mental Health Concepts," we describe the development, process, and methods of a multidisciplinary investigative approach for bridging non-English and English-language mental health concepts. In the second section, "Cultural Semantics for Mental Health Providers," we illustrate the need for cultural semantics in mental health. Section three, "The Use of Interpreters in Mental Health Counseling," explores the issues of introducing interpreters into the provider-client relationship and suggests some guidelines for using interpreters in mental health counseling. In the summary section, we will review key implications for research and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {History can be thought of as a collection of stories. It can be a story of a people, event, experience, or observation; written from the eyes of the beholder, it is always subjective. It is in this spirit that we share the story of colonialism in Hawai'i. In telling our story, we mean no disrespect to the Hawaiian or any other culture. For us, the story of colonialism in Hawai'i is ongoing and more than a clash of cultures; it is a story of a nation fighting for its soul, reclaiming the freedom to be: to live, govern, and define itself. Oppression manifests itself in many forms. In Hawai'i, the focus tends to be on the oppressions of colonialism. Military intimidation and racism, tools of the colonizer, are used to dispossess a people of their land, psyche, and souls. Colonization is a violent process, and decolonization sometimes can be equally violent. As we observe and participate in protests against the military in Hawai'i, we are swept in a sea of emotion: a deep love of the spirit of the aina, or land, the ocean, and the sky. As the stewards of the land, entrusted by their gods, sages, and ancestors, the Hawaiian people protest the desecration of their land. As participant-observers of this energy, we ask, "How does a nation with over 2,000 years of history heal from colonization? How does a nation reclaim its soul?"

Abstract = {The focus of this chapter is to identify some of the limitations that affect one's ability to make the kind of contributions desired. Some may be related to ethnic/cultural factors, and others may reflect the sociocultural context of the environment. Part of success is an awareness of what one brings to a situation (beliefs, values, ethnicity, gender, etc.) as well as ability to assess the expectations of the situation. It is hoped that with an increased awareness of the factors that may limit one's opportunities, the individual will be able to more consciously employ strategies that bring the positive contributions desired. Another intent of this chapter is to provide information about what to anticipate based on the specific circumstance and how the person may handle any challenges that arise from ethnic/cultural differences. Attention to one's preferred style of interaction among the expectations and demands of the setting or context is often key to developing appropriate coping strategies. In addition, the chapter will also address the importance of providing opportunities that enable people to collaborate with one another as equals so that they can see how their combined talents can effectively achieve mutually shared goals and interests.

Abstract = {This issue's "Forum" engages race and religion in the United States through one particularly interesting manifestation, the multiracial (multiethnic, multicultural) congregation. From one perspective, one might not think of multiracial congregations as being that big a deal, given the nation's core and shared Christian history and continued Christian majority, its tradition of religious switching and individualism, and the social and geographic mobility that currently marks our economy and society. Shouldn't Christian congregations also be racially diverse? But we know that such congregations are comparatively rare, and that they often require a great deal of intentionality and hard work to build or maintain--in part because our religious voluntarism seems not to reinforce them. And, we are in a political season in which (at least as of this writing before the Iowa caucuses) both race and religion have been highlighted in the presidential campaigns of both parties. Thus, this scholarly issue, and this Forum, seem timely and important. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In the United States, mixed-race people must either deny their multiracial identity by identifying with only a single race or create an identity that is not recognized or validated by the broader society. Consequently, the core issue facing mixed-race people is how to identify racially and manage the assortment of dynamics, dilemmas, and challenges associated with racial identification in a society that denies and devalues multiracial identity. This chapter examined several family dynamics that commonly undermine or compromise how mixed-race children explore, define, assert, and negotiate their racial identities. Strategies for intervention were presented, including how to support parents in teaching their children how to understand and manage encounters with racism.

Campaigns such as these, which require sophisticated planning, organizing, and advocacy skills, are noteworthy not just for their political impact, but also because of the insights they provide about learning environments outside of school. In this study I adopted Rogoff's (2003) theory of guided participation as a lens through which to analyze adult approaches to working with youth and how these approaches relate to opportunities for youth to participate in social action. Drawing on 2 years of ethnographic fieldwork in 3 multiracial activism groups, I found that adults managed tensions between youth empowerment principles and the task demands of campaigns in 3 distinct ways: facilitation, apprenticeship, and joint work. This analysis is relevant to educators who wish to support youth participation in mature social practices and researchers interested in elective learning environments.

This book a collection of essays that critically explore the role of US President Barack Obama’s biracial background not only in his 2008 election and first term in office but also in the context of an increasingly multiracial USA. This volume is part of a multidisciplinary body of scholarship on 'mixed race' or multiraciality that has grown exponentially in the USA and the UK over the past two decades. However, it also departs from this scholarship’s tendency to focus exclusively on the topics of identity formation and racial classification on government forms. Instead, utilizing the timely case of President Obama -'the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas'- the book examines what Jolivette terms ‘mixed race hegemony’, the assertion that 'biracial and multiracial individuals and families will lead to the end of a race-conscious and racially-discriminatory society in the United States'. Overall, many race scholars, likely, will find Jolivette’s concept of ‘mixed race hegemony’ a more contextualized alternative to broader terms like ‘colour-blindness’ in the critical examinations of multiraciality.

Bean’s book comes at a much-needed moment. They purport to empirically assess the important forces of new immigration, the diversity it brings, and the resulting dynamics of interracial marriage and multiracial identification—beacons of light in the harbor of what they position as a new racial reality in the United States. Lee and Bean’s empirical conclusion: racial boundaries appear to be loosening for all groups through diversity. The paradox is that this loosening of racial boundaries can sometimes be offset by negative group-size dynamics: the larger the minority’s size relative to the majority group, the greater the potential for a hardening of racial boundaries. They argue that “this paradox operates primarily to affect the social status of Blacks”. The authors opt for a mixed-methods approach. Ultimately, however, their project ends up with data that are collected via different methods, but not analyzed methodologically in a mixed manner.

Several things stand out: (a) The Sentinel’s reporting for that period almost tripled output from all Black newspapers for 1980-1992; (b) the focus and breadth of coverage changed, from highlighting enmity between Korean (American) merchants and Blacks to emphasizing interminority collaboration and inclusion in a wide range of settings; and (c) rarely noted were intimate relationships and personal ties.

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined the relationships among sexual minority status, sex, and mental health and suicidality, in a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adolescents. Methods: Using pooled data from 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys within 14 jurisdictions, we used hierarchical linear modeling to examine 6 mental health outcomes across 6 racial/ethnic groups, intersecting with sexual minority status and sex. Based on an omnibus measure of sexual minority status, there were 6245 sexual minority adolescents in the current study. The total sample was n = 72 691. Results: Compared with heterosexual peers, sexual minorities reported higher odds of feeling sad; suicidal ideation, planning and attempts; suicide attempt treated by a doctor or nurse, and self-harm. Among sexual minorities, compared with White youths, Asian and Black youths had lower odds of many outcomes, whereas American Native/Pacific Islander, Latino, and Multiracial youths had higher odds. Conclusions: Although in general, sexual minority youths were at heightened risk for suicidal outcomes, risk varied based on sex and on race/ethnicity. More research is needed to better understand the manner in which sex and race/ ethnicity intersect among sexual minorities to influence risk and protective factors, and ultimately, mental health outcomes.

The purpose of this research was to measure the prevalence of student risk factors and protective factors by race and ethnicity and assess the engagement of Asian youth in prevention services. Results indicated statistically significant racial and ethnic group differences in the prevalence of risk factors (self-reported depressive symptoms, substance use, externalizing behavior at school, failing grades, truancy, and discrimination by school adults and peers), and protective factors (school, home, and peer assets). Controlling for gender, family structure, risk behaviors, protective factors, and school composition, Black (OR = 2.31, p < .001), Latino (OR = 1.36, p < .05), and multiracial (OR = 1.42, p < .01) students had significantly higher odds of using their SBMH program than Asian students. Among Asian ethnic subgroups, Cambodian youth (OR = .62, p < .01), were the only group that had lower odds of accessing school-based services than their Chinese peers. Findings suggest that, to reach underserved Asian American adolescents, prevention programs must address cultural and contextual influences on adolescent help seeking when program outreach and enrollment strategies are being developed. Additional research in the field of prevention science is needed to understand the mechanisms driving patterns of prevention service use by race and ethnicity.

Abstract = {The basic tenet of passing is that multiracial individuals are a subordinate race or ethnic group. It is a concept that began with the rape of enslaved women. Hypodescence, or the 1-drop rule, specified that such offspring were considered Black and therefore should remain enslaved. Many of these offspring, however, passed as White and took on a White identity physically and sometimes psychologically. Passing is still very important in the 21st century, where the term cultural competence has become a buzzword for many. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry defines cultural competence as a “set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies found in a system, agency, or professionals that enables them to work effectively in a context of cultural difference.” Although those in the medical field are getting better at practicing cultural competence, there is the occasional patient who falls below the radar. During my childhood, for example, I was frequently annoyed, and to some degree felt personal discomfort, that strangers assumed I was White when that was only part of how I viewed myself. If I had decided to pass as White, I could have avoided this conflict but would have been confronted by many others. Through openly, and without apology, asking about and discussing racial identification, even in patients who appear 100% White, you can stop these children, like me, from falling below the radar. A simple question on an intake form does not cut it, because a phenotypically White, biracial individual passing as White may identify only as White, for example, causing us to completely misunderstand this patient. We must do better. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Commitment is a complex attitude that is potentially influenced by the nature of the groups and is contingent on the context in which an individual functions. Thus, different sociocultural environments will prescribe different imperatives for individuals’ or groups’ attitudes toward their work, particularly teachers’ commitment in a multi-ethnic educational setting. However, previous teacher commitment studies have predominantly been applied to single-sample studies in a multiracial Malaysian context. Therefore, this study attempts to compare the teacher commitment levels and the four dimensions of teacher commitment across Malay, Chinese and Indian teachers who are the dominant ethnicities in three different types of Malaysian primary schools. Questionnaires were administered to 1,154 primary school teachers in Penang, and the obtained data were analysed using AMOS 20.0 and SPSS 20.0. The findings revealed nonsignificant differences for commitment to school, commitment to students, commitment to teaching and commitment to profession for any pair of ethnic groups. Limitations and suggestions for future studies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Minorities are more prevalent than the general population in the child protection system; however, racial/ethnic disparities in physical abuse and child protective services interventions are not understood. Methods: Bivariate and multivariate analyses evaluated racial/ethnic differences in reported and substantiated physical abuse, physical abuse deaths, and interventions provided in all reported maltreatment from the 2006 National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System. Results: In bivariate analyses, African American (25%), Asian/Pacific Islander (21%), and multiracial children (21%) have a higher prevalence of substantiated physical abuse than whites (20%). Native Americans (0.21%), African Americans (0.15%), Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.12%), and Latinos (0.11%) are more likely to die from physical abuse than whites (0.09%). African Americans have higher odds than whites of reported (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.14) and substantiated (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.23-1.31) physical abuse. Latinos have higher odds of reported physical abuse (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.16-1.20) and lower odds of substantiated physical abuse (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96). Native Americans have lower odds (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.49-0.56) and Asian/Pacific Islanders higher odds (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.26-1.44) of reported physical abuse vs whites. Latinos have significantly lower odds than whites of receiving support services. Conclusions: Compared with whites, African Americans are at increased risk. Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, and multiracial children have greater odds of reports, and Native Americans have lower odds of reports for physical abuse. Significant disparities exist in interventions provided to minority families. Understanding these disparities has the potential to improve reporting, prevention, and interventions.

Abstract = {In this article, Maria Kromidas explores how nine-, ten-, and eleven-year-old children in a diverse neighborhood school in immigrant New York City navigated and often undermined hegemonic notions of difference and belonging offered by mainstream multiculturalism and raciology. Based on ethnographic research and utilizing a fine-grained sociocultural linguistic analysis, Kromidas demonstrates how the children subverted the most dehumanizing elements of these ideologies—most notably their essentialism and absolutism and their basis in blood, birth, and bodies. She argues that the children provide a compelling vision for living with difference, one that emerged from the rich experiences and everyday-ness of multiracial living.

Abstract = {Background: Few studies have simultaneously included exposure information on occupational hazards, relationship hazards (eg, intimate partner violence) and social hazards (eg, poverty and racial discrimination), especially among low-income multiracial/ethnic populations. Methods: A crass-sectional study (2003-2004) of 1,202 workers employed at 14 worksites in the greater Boston area of Massachusetts investigated the independent and joint association of occupational, social and relationship hazards with psychological distress (K6 scale). Results: Among this low-income cohort (45% were below the US poverty line), exposure to occupational, social and relationship hazards, per the 'inverse hazard law,' was high: 82% exposed to at least one occupational hazard, 79% to at least one social hazard, and 32% of men and 34% of women, respectively, stated they had been the perpetrator or target of intimate partner violence (IPV). Fully 15.4% had clinically significant psychological distress scores (K6 score ≥13). All three types of hazards, and also poverty, were independently associated with increased risk of psychological distress. In models including all three hazards, however, significant associations with psychological distress occurred among men and women for workplace abuse and high exposure to racial discrimination only; among men, for IPV; and among women, for high exposure to occupational hazards, poverty and smoking. Conclusions: Reckoning with the joint and embodied reality of diverse types of hazards involving how people live and work is necessary for understanding determinants of health status.

At the time of her publication, she shared that future research should apply this model to individuals who are biracial and bisexual. In 2008, the author conducted a study of 6 female college students who identify as multiracial/biracial–bisexual/pansexual to gain a better understanding of how students with multiple-marginal identities developed their identity. The author used the model that Collins proposed as a platform. In the present article, the author evaluates Collins’s proposed model in light of her findings and provides a four-phase alternative for framing the identity development experience of multiracial/biracial–bisexual/pansexual individuals.

Abstract = {The United Nations' (UN) support for Namibia has had a long and varied history that is now, two decades after Namibian independence, fully ripe for evaluation. The UN's peacekeeping operation, which was deployed in Namibia in 1989-90, has generally been assessed by scholars and practitioners as one of the more successful UN missions, and it is often seen as a role model for other multi-dimensional peacekeeping operations. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) was also the first UN peacekeeping operation in which a comprehensive information campaign was conducted, even though UNTAG had no explicit mandate for either nation-building or for conducting information campaigns. This chapter explores the development and practice of UNTAG's information program, i.e., the communication arm of this UN-run intervention in the long-standing civil and regional conflict in southern Africa, a conflict which had destabilized the region for several decades. UNTAG's third-party intervention transformed the territory of Namibia from an apartheid-dominated, externally-governed state to an independent, democratic government with constitutional guarantees of racial equality. The chapter will analyze how, by injecting a multi-cultural and multiracial presence in a society long dominated by apartheid and masterminded by South African occupiers, the UN applied its organizational credo of "cultural internationalism."

Abstract = {The present research capitalized on the prominence and multiracial heritage of U.S. 2008 presidential election candidate Barack Obama to examine whether individual differences in classifying him as Black or as multiracial corresponded to differences in implicit perception of race. This research used a newly developed task (Sedlins, Malahy, & Shoda, 2010) with digitally morphed mixed-race faces to assess implicit race perception. Participants completed this task four times before and one time after the election. We found that people who labeled Obama as Black implicitly perceived race as more categorical than those who labeled Obama as multiracial. This finding adds to the growing literature on multiracial perception by demonstrating a relationship between the explicit use of multiracial and monoracial race classification and implicit race perception. The results suggest potential implications for governmental, educational, and judiciary usage of racial categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Despite extensive research on multiracial youth in recent years, to date, no empirical studies have analyzed how racial context may affect biracial adolescents' sense of belonging in a social institution beyond families. In this study, we examine how the racial makeup of the student body affects self-identified biracial adolescents' school attachment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that the proportions of white or black students in school significantly affect the school attachment of Hispanic/black, Asian/black, and American Indian/black biracial adolescents, but school racial composition in general has little influence on biracial adolescents with a partial-white identification (i.e., black/white, Hispanic/white, Asian/white, and American Indian/white). Our analyses also show that on average, students of most biracial groups display lower school attachment than their corresponding monoracial groups, but the differences from the monoracial groups with the lower school attachment are generally small. We discuss the implications of our findings for biracial adolescents' perceived racial boundaries and contemporary American race relations.

Abstract = {Multiracial individuals are in the unique position of being able to categorize themselves as members of multiple racial groups. Drawing on self-categorization theory, we suggest that similarity to the minority ingroup depends on self-perceptions of physical appearance and connectedness to the minority ingroup. Moreover, we argue that similarity to the ingroup determines self-categorization as minority, which predicts category-based entitlements such as perceived eligibility for minority resources (e.g., affirmative action). Using path analysis, we found support for this model on a convenience sample of 107 mixed-race minority–White participants. The results suggest that affective processes rather than observable characteristics such as prototypical physical appearance better predict self-categorization among mixed-race individuals.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, We Can't Teach What We Don't Know: White Teachers, Multiracial Schools by Gary R. Howard (see record [rid]2006-08826-000[/rid]). According to Elias, any educator today, no matter what their field, is impacted in some way not only by the increasing diversity of American classrooms but also by the increasing dialogue about issues of race and culturally responsive teaching. In the second edition of We Can't Teach What We Don't Know: White Teachers, Multiracial Schools, Gary R. Howard writes about his experiences as a White teacher in multicultural education. The central theme of this book addresses how to prepare current, predominately White teachers to be effective educators in the face of an increasingly diverse and struggling population of students. Howard challenges White educators to undergo intense personal transformation by looking deep within and addressing the assumptions and perceptions held as a White person. Only then, Howard contends, can White educators understand the role they have in dismantling White-dominated school structures. In this book, Howard weaves together personal and theoretical lenses to help White educators achieve transformation. Elias notes that for many, this book can serve as a powerful starting point for naming Whiteness and beginning the dialogue about the assumptions and pedagogical practices related to being a White educator. However, for others, the tone of this book may be somewhat off-putting. This book addresses issues of race, dominance, teaching for social justice, and culturally responsive teaching.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, People of the Dream: Multiracial Congregations in the United States by Michael O. Emerson, with Rodney M. Woo (see record [rid]2006-07915-000[/rid]). According to the authors, those most likely to attend segregated churches are Blacks in rural churches, with lower-than-average educational levels (p. 162). Who attends racially diverse churches? The authors state that "people of mixed-race congregations are, on average, considerably different from other Americans" (p. 97), "people who seem to flow across racial categories and divisions" (p. 6). So much so, in fact, that Emerson invents a new term for them: "Sixth Americans" (p. 99) who do not fit socially into one of Emerson's five racial categories of Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American. Emerson is very clear that it is multiracial, not multiethnic, groups he is interested in. The book concentrates on Protestant churches, which is not surprising, given their marked differences in size and polity from Catholic churches. However, Catholic congregations pop in and out of the picture irregularly. Exactly where the Mormons, the fourth largest denominational group in the United States, fit in is unclear; aside from a passing reference to research on Black Mormons (p. 122) they do not appear. A graph concerning the relation between "level of market share" and "level of segregation" (p. 42) includes only the categories of Catholic, mainline Protestants, conservative Protestants, and non-Christians. The topic of multiracial congregations is certainly one worthy of research. A search of the Sommervogel Archive, a bibliography of over 60,000 in the social scientific study of religion (Donahue, 1999), produced only 10 relevant references when looking for the words racial, multiracial, or multi-racial in the title of dissertations, journal articles, and contributions to edited volumes. Emerson's own research combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to examining these congregations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

As Lord Sebastian Coe commentated, both aspects were interlinked: a strong performance by India was crucial for the involvement of the Indian Diaspora in the Olympics. But how did the Indian Diaspora actually react to the Games? Where did its loyalties lie, and how did it embrace the Olympic spectacle? Also, as the Games progressed, they drew further attention to the great multicultural inclusiveness of Great Britain. At the heart of Britain’s great Olympic success were the performances of those athletes from multiracial backgrounds, notably the British athlete Jessica Ennis as well as those who had migrated to the UK such as Mo Farah. Britain embraced the success of Ennis and Farah as their own. Will those of Indian origin, and particularly budding sportspeople of the Indian community, take this as a positive sign? Will it spur the community to have greater representation in sports in UK? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Whereas members of high-status racial groups show ingroup preference when attitudes are measured implicitly, members of low-status racial groups—both adults and children—typically show no bias, potentially reflecting awareness of the ingroup’s low status. We hypothesized that when status differences are especially pronounced, children from low-status groups would show an implicit outgroup bias, the strength of which might relate to attitudes toward status. We tested these predictions among 6- to 11-year-old Black and Coloured (i.e., multiracial) children from South Africa, a country marked by extreme status differentials among racial groups. As a measure of implicit intergroup bias, children (N = 78) completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT), a speeded categorization task that assesses the relative strength of association between 2 target groups (in the present study, either Whites vs. Blacks or Whites vs. Coloureds) and positive vs. negative evaluation. Children also completed explicit (i.e., self-report) measures of attitudes toward racial groups as well as toward rich and poor people (a measure of attitudes toward status). Both groups of children showed an implicit outgroup-favoring (i.e., pro-White) bias, suggesting that children were sensitive to the extent of status differences. The only instance in which implicit pro-White bias did not emerge involved Black children’s evaluations of Whites vs. Coloureds, both higher-status outgroups. Explicit preference for high status predicted implicit pro-White bias, particularly when the IAT contrasted 2 outgroups. The impact of status on the development of implicit and explicit intergroup bias is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Using 2004 Online Survey, Certification and Reporting data, Minimum Data Set, Lewis Mumford Center for Comparative Urban and Regional Research data, and the Area Resource File, we included U.S. Medicare/Medicaid certified nursing homes (N = 8950) located in 310 Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The dependent variable quantified facility-level multiracial diversity. Ordinary least squares regression showed support for the hypothesized relationships: for-profit/chain affiliated nursing homes were more diverse than nursing homes in all other ownership/chain member categories, while higher Medicaid per-diem rates, greater residential diversity, and stronger market competition were also positively associated with nursing home racial/ethnic composition.

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: Health care reform offers a new opportunity to address child health disparities. This study sought to characterize racial differences in pediatric asthma readmissions with a focus on the potential explanatory role of hardships that might be addressed in future patient care models. Methods: We enrolled 774 children, aged 1 to 16 years, admitted for asthma or bronchodilator-responsive wheezing in a population-based prospective observational cohort. The outcome was time to readmission. Child race, socioeconomic status (measured by lower income and caregiver educational attainment), and hardship (caregivers looking for work, having no one to borrow money from, not owning a car or home, and being single/never married) were recorded. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards. Results: The cohort was 57% African American, 33% white, and 10% multiracial/other; 19% were readmitted within 12 months. After adjustment for asthma severity classification, African Americans were twice as likely to be readmitted as whites (hazard ratio: 1.98; 95% confidence interval: 1.42 to 2.77). Compared with whites, African American caregivers were significantly more likely to report lower income and educational attainment, difficulty finding work, having no one to borrow money from, not owning a car or home, and being single/never married (all P ≤.01). Hardships explained 41% of the observed racial disparity in readmission; jointly, socioeconomic status and hardship explained 49%. Conclusions: African American children were twice as likely to be readmitted as white children; hardships explained >40% of this disparity. Additional factors (eg, pollution, tobacco exposure, housing quality) may explain residual disparities. Targeted interventions could help achieve greater child health equity.

Abstract = {Background: A good deal of evidence indicates that students’ motivational beliefs and attitudes play a critical role in their academic success. Research studies on how motivational factors may help determine whether students remain in high school or drop out, however, are relatively few. More specifically, there is a lack of research examining the dynamics of whether students’ motivational beliefs from earlier in high school might be used to predict their status as a dropout in their final year. Aims: The aim of the present study was to examine the mediating role of students’ educational expectations in linking students’ school motivation to their dropout status by utilizing a nationally representative dataset. Sample: The present study used data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS: 2002). The final sample consisted of 16,194 students, with approximately 54% White, 13% Black, 16% Hispanic, and 10% Asian students, and the rest were Native American, Hawaiian, multiracial, or of other races. Method: Structural equation modeling was employed to conduct the mediational analysis. Results: The results of the present study demonstrated that the relationships between student ability beliefs in math and English and student behavior of dropping out were fully mediated by students’ educational expectations. The results also revealed that student intrinsic value in math and English had significant indirect relations with student behavior of leaving school through students’ educational expectations. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that explanations for student dropout status that rely solely on students’ social background and school behaviors without considering their motivation are incomplete. The study expands the extant research by showing possible pathways that motivate students to persist in high school. These pathways are specifically rooted in students’ ability beliefs and intrinsic interest in learning through their relationships with students’ expectations for their education.

Pediatrics had a greater percentage of women chairs compared with most other departments in the clinical sciences in 2012. About 20% of all pediatric chairs were women and 12% of these were categorized as underrepresented minorities or multiracial chairs. Increasing racial and ethnic diversity among health professionals is important because evidence indicates that diversity is associated with improved access to care for racial and ethnic minority patients, greater patient choice and satisfaction, and better educational experiences for health professional students among many other benefits. Everyone should work together to promote diversity and inclusion so that children’s health can truly benefit from the talent that each of us uniquely brings to improving the health of children in this country and around the world.

Abstract = {We hypothesize that the manner in which stereotype threat affects college-grade achievement is mediated by institutional context as well as individual characteristics. Drawing on a sample of black students from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, we find weak and inconsistent evidence that institutional characteristics influence the operation of stereotype threat. We find more consistent evidence to indicate that the effect of stereotype threat is conditioned by individual factors such as skin colour, multiracial origins and an integrated upbringing. Most of the effect on grade achievement occurs through the internalization pathway, in which the internalization of negative stereotypes leads to disinvestment manifested by a reduction in academic effort. The reduction in work effort, in turn, lowers grades. We also find evidence that immigrant origin confers protection from the negative effects of stereotype threat through both internalization and externalization mechanisms, although the ultimate effect of grade achievement is rather small.

Abstract = {As one of the oldest Asian American groups in the USA, most Japanese Americans are of the third and fourth generations and have become well integrated in mainstream American society. However, they are still racialized as foreigners simply because of their Asian appearance. Their Asian phenotype continues to have a foreigner connotation because of large-scale immigration from Asia and an American national identity that is racially defined as white. This paper analyses how later-generation Japanese Americans are racialized as outsiders in their daily interaction with mainstream Americans, which is often accompanied by essentialized assumptions that they are also culturally foreign. In response, they engage in everyday struggles for racial citizenship by demanding inclusion in the national community as Americans despite their racial differences. It is uncertain whether such attempts to contest their racialization will cause current mono-racial notions of American identity to be reconsidered in more inclusive and multiracial ways.

Abstract = {The pattern of racial identification among Puerto Ricans is not uniform. It varies depending on where they live. Most identify as white, but more do so in Puerto Rico than in the USA. This paper addresses the impact that living alternatively in the USA and in Puerto Rico has on racial identification among Puerto Ricans. Using Public Use Microdata Sample data from the American Community Survey and the Puerto Rico Community Survey 2006-2008, I find that while there is no single pattern of impact, those more grounded on the island’s racial system are more likely to identify as white in the USA, while those less grounded in Puerto Rico are more likely to identify as multiracial or by another racial descriptor. On their return to the island, they revert to the prevalent pattern of racial identification, while still exhibiting effects of their sojourn on their racial identity.

Abstract = {Background: Given the rising rates of obesity in children and adolescents, developing evidence-based weight loss or weight maintenance interventions that can be widely disseminated, well implemented, and are highly scalable is a public health necessity. Such interventions should ensure that adolescents establish healthy weight regulation practices while also reducing eating disorder risk. Objective: This study describes an online program, StayingFit, which has two tracks for universal and targeted delivery and was designed to enhance healthy living skills, encourage healthy weight regulation, and improve weight/shape concerns among high school adolescents. Methods: Ninth grade students in two high schools in the San Francisco Bay area and in St Louis were invited to participate. Students who were overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 85th percentile) were offered the weight management track of StayingFit; students who were normal weight were offered the healthy habits track. The 12-session program included a monitored discussion group and interactive self-monitoring logs. Measures completed pre- and post-intervention included self-report height and weight, used to calculate BMI percentile for age and sex and standardized BMI (zBMI), Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) nutrition data, the Weight Concerns Scale, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Results: A total of 336 students provided informed consent and were included in the analyses. The racial breakdown of the sample was as follows: 46.7% (157/336) multiracial/other, 31.0% (104/336) Caucasian, 16.7% (56/336) African American, and 5.7% (19/336) did not specify; 43.5% (146/336) of students identified as Hispanic/Latino. BMI percentile and zBMI significantly decreased among students in the weight management track. BMI percentile and zBMI did not significantly change among students in the healthy habits track, demonstrating that these students maintained their weight. Weight/shape concerns significantly decreased among participants in both tracks who had elevated weight/shape concerns at baseline. Fruit and vegetable consumption increased for both tracks. Physical activity increased among participants in the weight management track, while soda consumption and television time decreased. Conclusions: Results suggest that an Internet-based, universally delivered, targeted intervention may support healthy weight regulation, improve weight/shape concerns among participants with eating disorders risk, and increase physical activity in high school students. Tailored content and interactive features to encourage behavior change may lead to sustainable improvements in adolescent health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {One of us knows someone of multiracial origins whose T-shirt reads, "And what are YOU?" This is a 21st-century dilemma: Globalized, multicultural social interaction goes beyond the homogenized category-based models (I'm an X; you are a Y) that served well enough in the last half of the 20th century; in those days, people participated in more (literally) black-and-white encounters. As our collective group awareness becomes more complicated, people face the challenges of others' identities that are more variable, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (Bodenhausen & Peery, 2009). Making sense of people nowadays renders simple categories problematic. Category-based issues are not solved now by any means; we are not beyond categories in any sense. But some progress has been made, and while we as people and as scientists continue to address these issues, we two as authors propose here looking beyond categorization to our putative ideal, individuation. This chapter examines the what, when, why, how, and who of individuating processes, and whether they are really a good ideal, anyway. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In the latest edition of this best-selling text, distinguished counselors David Capuzzi and Douglas Gross, along with 24 experts in the field, provide a prevention-intervention paradigm to address contemporary issues facing today's youth. Written from a systemic perspective, this book offers guidance in helping teens who are struggling with the complex challenges that can be brought on by peers, family members, and difficult social environments. Part 1 presents information on at-risk population Identification, causal factors of problematic behaviors, and promotion of resiliency in youth. Part 2 examines the development of at-risk behaviors relating to dysfunctional family dynamics, low self-esteem, depression, mood disorders, and stress and trauma. Part 3 explores the behaviors most often identified as placing youth at risk, such as eating disorders, suicidal preoccupation, teen sexuality, gang membership, school violence, substance abuse, homelessness, school dropout, and bullying, as well as the unique strengths of and stressors faced by multiracial and LGBTQ youth. Case studies illustrate prevention efforts from individual, family, school, and community perspectives, and text sidebars create greater reader self-awareness and enhance the understanding of the concepts, skills, and applications of the chapter material.

Abstract = {In this chapter, the authors consider the ways in which mixed-race identities are constructed in Australia and New Zealand, both relatively new nation states with histories as British settler societies. Australia and New Zealand have experienced little debate in the public sphere about mixed race and minimal impact from international discussion on the subject. Even media coverage of Barack Obama as mixed race at the time of his election did not trigger a conversation about racial terminology. Likewise when Australia's former prime minister John Howard commented that he would prefer a multiracial policy rather than a multicultural one, the comment fell into a void. The issues that have claimed most prominence in relation to race in both Australia and New Zealand have been the effects of migrant intake and the interaction between colonizers, other immigrants, and indigenous peoples. Australia and New Zealand are relatively young countries, built around a model of the nation-state as it emerged in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This model implies close links between ethno-racial and political identity, and as such fits uncomfortably within settler societies, which have generally grown through constant migration of people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds, often resulting in mixed offspring. Neither Australia nor New Zealand has formally named mixed race populations, in the way that Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, colonial India, and some other countries have. Race is rarely an explicit focus of current policies in Australia and New Zealand, and neither country offers a color option in their census. This chapter uses several examples to illustrate the complexities of dealing with mixed race in contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Drawing from Omi's and Winant's racial formation theory, the competing narratives are defined racial projects that exhibit both cultural and political initiatives endeavoring to bring about social structural change. The cultural initiatives involve identity politics that strive to rescue identities from distortion and erasure by the dominant society; the political initiatives seek to reorganize and redistribute resources, and have called upon the state to play a key role. This chapter examines these racial projects as they relate to the intersection of Black and multiracial identity politics and the politics of collecting racial data as in the census and affirmative action. In order to achieve their objectives, these projects have engaged in what racial formation theory defines as re-articulation. This entails redefining racial identities and political interests by recombining familiar ideas and values in new ways. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, this piece examines the role of race and the ways in which it has been discussed or ignored in support of a middle-class, White, male ideal "voice" in technical communication. Second, this discussion examines the potential of Twitter to create local contexts wherein the public performance of ethnicity builds knowledge through inclusive code-switching in collaborative networks while preparing students to meet the needs of growing multiracial audiences. While Twitter has served as a means of communication between businesses and clients, there remains unexplored potential in the application of Twitter in courses in which students are allowed to demonstrate ethnic markers in the form of linguistic diversity. As businesses seek to court the diverse Latina market, it becomes necessary to confront how ethnic performance of linguistic diversity has been framed negatively as a racial marker; after doing so, it then becomes possible to conceptualize new practices to better prepare students who join transnational companies to communicate, within local contexts, with radically local audiences.

Abstract = {In this chapter, Benjamin Shobert analyzes how the Chinese view US President Barack Obama. As a business consultant, Shobert has seen China from both close-up and afar for almost two decades. As China rises, it creates different reactions in the United States, which in turn help to shape China's diplomatic and long-term strategic response. Shobert discusses how the Obama administration is perceived by the Chinese government, various policy makers, and the public. He suggests alternative paths for US-China relations in the decades to come and how the Obama administration can be instrumental in shaping this critical relationship. Seen in this context, recent efforts by president Obama and the new Chinese president, Xi Jinping to create a special understanding between them—and thereby between the two countries—augur well for the future of their relationship. In Shobert's view, most members of China's sober political and economic elite perceive Obama as a rather weak leader who is finding it difficult to navigate successfully through Washington's corridors of power. Short of experience and guanxi (connections and loyalties based on past favors and ongoing interdependencies), he is seen by many as a weak administrator lacking in planning or business experience. In contrast, Obama's soaring speeches leave China's aging leaders cold—for them, they mostly contain verbiage addressed to immature idealists unfamiliar with the hard realities of administering a recalcitrant society and empire. We might add that neither are China's leaders or the populace impressed by the multiracial dimensions of Obama's political success since in East Asia (e.g., China, Japan, South Korea), anti-African and anti-African-American racism remains a distinct influence. After all, many idealized and admired heroes and heroines in Chinese novels are depicted as having skin "as white as porcelain," and consequently, it should come as no surprise that the Chinese and Korean markets for skin-bleaching creams are thriving.

Abstract = {Psychologists, as well as the general public, have recognized the importance of female friendships. Scientists call this bond the tending instinct—a kind of female relaxation response that has salutary effects. Such special attachment shields women from isolation and provides an enhanced sense of wellbeing. Intimate friends can therefore act as sisters of the heart to promote connection, solace, wholeness, and longevity. Moreover, women friends frequently provide emotional, social, physical, and spiritual benefits. Indeed, sisters of the heart constitute an unparalleled bond that encourages women to connect with themselves, with others, and with the world at large. In this book, twelve women therapists, who are diverse in age—young, middle-aged, and older women—as well as in ethnicity—White, African American, Latina, Asian American, Native American, and multiracial, women—examine the psychological and physical aspects of this unique female bonding. Through their narratives we hear their distinctive voices as women and as healers. In this fashion, they reflect on both the functional and dysfunctional dynamics occurring between intimate female friends. Finally, these women therapists examine how their experiences with a sister of the heart informed their development as healers, and discuss how they use this special bond in psychotherapy with women.

We include both protective factors and risk factors in order to provide a balanced understanding of the experience of Latinas. This approach may also help researchers and service providers to find avenues to prevent depression and suicide by building on girls' internal and cultural strengths. This chapter provides a framing of the historical and current situation of Latina adolescent depressive symptoms and suicide attempts at national levels. Chapter 2 summarizes the most common theories of depression and suicidality. We use previous theories to help provide insight into the factors that may lead to depression and suicide. Chapter 3 then introduces a multiracial feminist framework that provides an ecodevelopmental resilience view of young Latinas. Chapter 3 also describes the current research on protective factors within ecological contexts. Chapter 4 extends our discussion on how positive development can be derailed for Latina girls by risk factors at micro-, meso-, and macroecological levels. Finally, Chap. 5 provides recommendations for researchers, clinicians, and schools about how they can help prevent and intervene among Latina adolescent populations with issues of depression and suicide. Our ultimate goal is to critically think through the epidemic of Latina adolescent suicide attempts and to motivate individuals to action that can help improve and save the lives of Latina adolescents in the United States.

Multiple dynamics are displayed in these chapters—gender and sexuality, tradition and change, local and global. East and West—as male identity is defined as a work in progress in locations as disparate as Ireland and Indonesia. Contributors analyze the larger paradoxes and ambiguities of studying masculinity and globalization, and of the gender contexts of globalization as a social phenomenon.

Abstract = {This article proposes a new method for measuring school desegregation in multiracial districts, and uses the new method to measure the desegregation effects of magnet schools in Los Angeles. Rather than measuring desegregation between only two groups at a time, I compute the index of interracial exposure for Blacks, Whites, Latinos, and Asians. Each of these figures is then combined to form a composite desegregation score. I find that magnet schools in Los Angeles are less segregated than nonmagnet schools, but that Whites and Asians are the most segregated groups and have become more segregated over time.

Abstract = {"Mom...what am I?" This simple question from my twelve-year-old daughter was enough to raise my anxiety as a parent. I immediately knew that she was asking me about race. She wanted a category. She needed an answer for her friends at school: "They keep asking me, and I don't know what to tell them." I thought that as the only non-white in her class at a private school, a straight-A student with a Spanish name, South American parents who both hold graduate degrees, and an upper-middle-class background, she did not fit the mainstream stereotype of a "Latina." Therefore, she confused her friends who wanted an answer. I thought. Welcome to the world of stereotypes, of prejudice and discrimination. My first experiences with discrimination were very painful. I was caught off guard in a world of social nuances based on race and hate. I lacked the intellectual and emotional arsenal that would have helped me to cope with the humiliation. As an upper-middle-class woman growing up in Venezuela, where the development of an ethnic identity was a non-issue (it was taken for granted), I did not have to negotiate my identity. I belonged to the group in power, and therefore, there was no need to articulate who I was. As in the United States, "ethnic" conversations were reserved for "the other." It was not until coming to the United States that I was consciously impacted by the issue of ethnic identity. I struggled to find a category that would include my Venezuelan and Lebanese heritages. It was my Spanish accent that finally determined who I was, as my phenotype (appearance) was confusing to many. People could not place me into one racial category. Root (1996, in Sue & Sue, 2003) indicates that this dilemma is typical of multiracial children, who are constantly confronted with ambiguous reactions from people who cannot place them within a clear racial category.

Abstract = {Historically, race has been constructed within the American psyche as a dichotomous variable. Language has developed to mirror this reality, which ultimately aids in its perpetuation. Presently, there remain cultural and linguistic disconnects between the phenomenological experience of the biracial individual and the expectations of the dualistic society within which they reside. On the individual level, there are implications for psychosocial development (Hall, 2001; Root, 1995). More broadly speaking, what will develop from the resolution of this dilemma is a new paradigm impacting how the citizens of this country view race and racial identity. This chapter explores the impact that the sociohistorical constructions of race and language have on the lives of biracial individuals. The author, who is biracial, will blend sociohistorical conceptions of race and linguistic philosophy with personal narrative components and conclude with implications for multiracial identity development.

Abstract = {Each chapter in this book offers new perspectives on current issues influencing the expression of prejudice and discrimination. Prejudice and discrimination is about more than race; it is about our inability to address differences, whether these differences apply to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability status, age, social class, or body size. All citizens have experienced negative psychological consequences that continue today in covert forms. It is this bias and discrimination that contribute to disparities in health, education, and socioeconomic status, and result in the inequity of services and opportunities in American society. In addressing racism in America, we need to avoid internalizing and accepting negative messages about a group's ability and intrinsic worth. We need to address the institutionalized racism that results in differential access to the goods, services, and opportunities afforded by society. We need to examine prejudice and discrimination in the context of our identities, which, in the 21st century, are multiple and intersecting. Identity is comprised not simply of our single identities of race or ethnicity, but also of multiracial identities, and the ways that identity is influenced by immigration, language, generation, and culture.

Abstract = {Significant effort has gone into understanding and promoting racial diversity in congregations. Still, uniting worshippers of different races remains a challenging endeavor. Even congregations that successfully attract worshippers of different races often have difficulty sustaining their multiracial composition. This study contributes to the discussion of race and religion by examining racial group differences in belonging and participation in congregations. Drawing on organizational ecology theory, we develop four hypotheses to test whether and how racial group size corresponds to congregational commitment. Results of multilevel modeling using 2001 U.S. Congregational Life Survey data reveal that those who are a part of a congregation’s largest racial group possess a stronger sense of belonging and participate at a deeper level than congregants of other races. Moreover, differences in belonging and participation by racial group persist regardless of group size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Given the increase of multiculturalism into the hospitality labor force, corporate investments in providing a positive diversity climate at work have increased over the last two decades. However, few studies have focused on managers’ perceived diversity climate and how their perceived diversity climate has an impact on their work experience, which is a significant gap in the literature considering that the hospitality workforce is diverse and multiracial. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of hotel managers’ perceived diversity climate on three outcomes: role ambiguity, role conflict, and job satisfaction. Survey data were collected from 130 hotel and lodging managers. The results showed that managers who perceived a positive diversity climate also reported less role ambiguity and role conflict, but more job satisfaction. Role ambiguity and role conflict mediated the relationship between perceived diversity climate and job satisfaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

A study was conducted to ascertain the degree of underrepresentation of these groups in gifted programs in Utah. Using state-collected data from 14,781 students in six representative school districts in Utah, it was found through multiple logistic regression analysis that there was no statistically significant difference in the likelihoods that Black, Hispanic, or Native American students and White students would be identified as gifted; Asian American and Pacific Islander students were more likely to be identified as gifted than White students. After controlling for academic achievement and SES, it was found that all diverse demographic groups of students were more likely to be identified as gifted than White students, although the differences did not reach statistical significance for multiracial or Native American students.

Abstract = {Much attention has been directed toward understanding the impact having a multiracial background has on psychological well-being and adjustment. Past psychological research has focused on the challenges multiracial individuals confront in defining a racial identity. The implication is that these challenges lead to outcomes that are psychologically detrimental. However, evidence to support this assertion is mixed. The authors review qualitative and quantitative empirical research examining multiracial individuals' identity development, depression, problem behaviors, peer relationships, school performance, and self-esteem, finding support for detrimental outcomes only in studies sampling clinical populations. Studies on nonclinical samples find that multiracial individuals tend to be just as well-adjusted as their monoracial peers on most psychological outcomes. Earlier assertions of maladjustment may have been due to reliance on qualitative research that sampled clinical populations. Other implications and future research are discussed.

In this article I draw on a seven-year ethnographic study to offer an intensive case study of white transracial birth parents that counters this racial logic. I draw on a subset of data collected from field research and in-depth interviews with 102 members of black-white interracial families in England. I provide an analysis of three practices that I discovered among white transracial birth parents who were attempting to cultivate 'black' identities in their children of multiracial heritage. I offer the concept of 'racial literacy' to theorize their parental labour as a type of anti-racist project that remains under the radar of conventional sociological analyses of racism and antiracist social movements.

Abstract = {According to the principle of hypodescent, multiracial individuals are categorized according to their most socially subordinate group membership. We investigated whether the tendency to apply this principle is related to political ideology. In three studies, participants categorized a series of morphed faces that varied in terms of racial ambiguity. In each study, self-reported conservatism (vs. liberalism) was associated with the tendency to categorize ambiguous faces as Black. Consistent with the notion that system justification motivation helps to explain ideological differences in racial categorization, the association between conservatism and hypodescent was mediated by individual differences in opposition to equality (Study 2) and was stronger when U.S. participants categorized American than Canadian faces (Study 3). We discuss ways in which the categorization of racially ambiguous individuals in terms of their most subordinate racial group may exacerbate inequality and vulnerability to discrimination.

Why? The present paper begins to establish the role of individual differences and social context in hypodescent, the process of assigning multiracials the status of their relatively disadvantaged parent group. Specifically, in two experiments, we found that individual differences in social dominance orientation—a preference for group-based hierarchy and inequality—interacts with perceptions of socioeconomic threat to influence the use of hypodescent in categorizing half-Black, half-White biracial targets. Importantly, this paper begins to establish hypodescent as a “hierarchy-enhancing” social categorization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Participants (60 % female) were 208 sixth through eighth grade students (63 % African American, 19 % Latino, 18 % Multiracial) from an urban middle school in the Midwestern United States. Youth completed an in-school survey with items on parenting (parental monitoring, mothers’/fathers’ warmth), cognitive engagement (school self-esteem), behavioral engagement (school trouble), and academic motivation (intrinsic motivation). As hypothesized, mothers’ warmth enhanced the association between parental monitoring and youths’ engagement and motivation. No gender differences in these associations emerged. Fathers’ warmth strengthened the negative association between parental monitoring and school trouble, and this association was stronger for boys. Implications regarding the importance of sustaining a high level of monitoring within the context of warm parent– adolescent relationships to best support academic outcomes among minority youth are discussed.

Karis, and Richard D. Powell (see record [rid]1995-98853-000[/rid]). The book provides a broad analysis of aspects of relating and having a public identity experienced by people in multiracial couples. The evidence reported only partially relates to the experience of prejudice or loss. The general categories of information obtained by Rosenblatt, Karis, and Powell include how families received the multiracial couples; the treatment couples experienced in interactions in the general public, such as in the workplace or in encounters with strangers while eating or shopping; issues in bringing up multiracial children; learning from each other and from different cultures; and couples finding support in their communities. The study had limits, especially its limited focus to African American and White relationships. At the same time, however, this is a pioneering effort in an area that deserves much greater attention in the relationship and family field. What the reviewers came away with from this book was a better sense of what multiracial couples encounter just "to be" in this society. Further, as is clear in the narratives, many communities are not likely to be as supportive of multiracial couples as is the Twin Cities area.

Abstract = {Background: Previously, we reported a high level of comfort among Californians for collecting race/ethnicity information by health care providers (HCPs). However, minorities were less comfortable providing race/ethnicity information and were more worried than non-Hispanic whites about the potential misuse of this information. Objective: To determine if perceived experiences of discrimination (both in general and in medical care) were associated with comfort providing race/ethnicity information, and conversely, to worry about providing the information. Design and participants: Telephone survey of 480 Californians, including 101 whites, 98 Asians, 173 Hispanics, 82 blacks, and 26 multiracial individuals. Measurements: Comfort level giving HCPs information about race/ethnicity (measured on a 1–10 scale, with text anchors of “very uncomfortable” at 1 and “very comfortable” at 10), worry that the information could be used to discriminate against patients, and worry that the information could be used to find undocumented immigrants. Worry was measured using a four-point Likert scale- not worried at all, a little worried, somewhat worried, and very worried. Respondents were also asked about perceived discrimination in general and perceived discrimination in medical care. Results: Compared to whites, Hispanics (Beta-coefficient (BC) = -1.16, SE = 0.51) and Mandarin/ Cantonese-speaking Asians (BC = -1.40, SE = 0.65) reported significantly less comfort giving HCPs information about their race/ethnicity, while blacks (BC = 0.70, SE = 0.16), Hispanics (BC = 0.91, SE = 0.18), and multiracial individuals (BC = 0.63, SE = 0.24) were significantly more worried that race/ethnicity information could be used to discriminate against them. Adjusting for perceived experiences of discrimination in general and in medical care partially explained the higher discomfort and worry among minorities. Conclusions: Perceived experiences of discrimination are associated with greater discomfort and worry about providing race/ethnicity data. Health care institutions should consider how they can address the public’s concerns about possible misuses of data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {How do members of disparate ethnic and racial heritages come to identify and achieve stable affiliation with multiracial congregations? This article specifies an approach to understanding member experiences of corporate belonging in diverse congregations using ethnic identity theory. Synthesizing ethnographic data drawn from two extensive case studies, the article provides a heuristic model for understanding the process by which members of disparate ethnic and racial heritages come to identify and achieve stable affiliation with multiethnic/multiracial congregations. Three “moments” (affinity with the congregation, identity reorientation, and ethnic transcendence) represent key phases in the lived religious experience of members as they co-construct common bonds of spiritual kinship. Cautions and suggestions are provided for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Each individual embarks on a search for self-identification as he or she moves through the developmental process. For many, this process can be quite personal; it focuses on, but is not limited to, sexual orientation, language, religion, gender, and education. For individuals who have a multiple heritage background, such as one parent with a Mexican heritage and the other with a Puerto Rican heritage, the process is much more complex. This chapter takes a historical look at several of the biracial and multiracial identity development models found in the literature. In addition, the chapter concludes with a description of the Multiple Heritage Identity Development (MHID) Model, which is referenced throughout the remaining chapters of the book.

Abstract = {This is the first textbook written to welcome those who are new to Asian American psychology. Concepts and theories come to life by relating the material to everyday experiences and by including activities, discussion questions, exercises, clinical case studies, and internet resources. Contributions from the leading experts and emerging scholars and practitioners in the field—the majority of whom have also taught Asian American psychology—feature current perspectives and key findings from the psychological literature. Part I of the book opens with the cornerstones of Asian American psychology, such as Asian American history and research methods. Part ll addresses how Asian Americans balance multiple worlds with topics such as racial identity, acculturation, and religion. Part IIl explores the psychological experiences of Asian Americans through the lens of gender and sexual orientation and their influence on relationships. Part IV discusses the emerging experiences of Asian Americans, including adoptees, parachute kids, and multiracial Asian Americans. Part V focuses on social and life issues facing Asian Americans such as racism and academics and career development. The text concludes with an examination of the physical and psychological well-being of Asian Americans and avenues for coping and healing. This ground-breaking volume is intended as an undergraduate/beginning graduate level introductory textbook on Asian American psychology taught in departments of psychology, Asian American and/or ethnic studies, counseling, sociology, and other social sciences. In addition, the clinical cases will also appeal to clinicians and other mental health workers committed to learning about Asian Americans.

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine associations between individual and vicarious racial discrimination via the Internet and psychological adjustment. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey using a school-based sample of adolescents. Two hundred sixty-four high school students aged 14-18 completed the online survey. Results: Twenty percent of whites, 29% of African Americans and 42% of multiracials/other experienced individual discrimination and approximately 71% of African Americans and whites and 67% of multiracials witnessed discrimination experienced by same-race and cross-race peers. Hierarchical linear regressions revealed that individual racial discrimination was significantly related to depression and anxiety over and above offline measures. Vicarious discrimination was not related to psychological adjustment measures. Conclusions: Adolescents frequently experienced both individual and vicarious discrimination online. Consistent with offline studies, online racial discrimination was negatively associated with psychological functioning. This study highlights the need to address racial issues in Internet safety prevention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Adolescents who are more religious are less likely to have sex, but the process by which religiosity impacts sexual behavior is not well established. We tested two potential processes, involving: (1) whether religiosity suppressed individuals' motivations to have sex for physical pleasure, and (2) whether individuals internalized their religions' teachings about sex for pleasure. College students (N = 610, 53.8% female, M age = 18.5, 26.1% Hispanic Latino [HL], 14.9% non-HL African American, 23.8% non-HL Asian American/Pacific Islander, 26.3% non-HL European American and 8.9% non-HL multiracial) completed web surveys during their first three semesters. Religiosity did not moderate the association between students' motivations for sex for pleasure and sexual behavior. Motivations mediated the association between religiosity and sexual behavior, suggesting that religion does not override adolescents' existing motivations, but instead, religious adolescents internalize norms about sexual behavior.

Abstract = {The paper examines Martín Rejtman's critical documentary work in the context of broader representations of Argentina, especially Buenos Aires, as a multicultural society. It contends that the notion of multiculturalism, as a description of postcolonial social formations, does not properly apply to the Argentine case, and that the construction of an image of Buenos Aires in terms of a harmonious, multiracial coexistence is an injurious misrepresentation. The paper first focuses on Rejtman's new approach to the cultural analysis of immigration in Argentina as it stems from the imposition of ‘curiosity’ and the adoption of an ethnographic perspective. Secondly, it assesses the relationship between this new proposal, the notion of multiculturalism, and its applicability to the Argentine context. Finally, it appraises the connections between the analysis of contemporary Argentina and the significance of the progression from a poetics of fiction to a poetics of documentary in Rejtman's Copacabana (2006) and his other films.

Abstract = {Religious factors have been shown to influence whites’ attitudes toward interracial marriage, but this relationship has yet to be studied in depth. This study examines how religious affiliation, beliefs, practices, and congregational composition affect whites’ attitudes toward interracial marriage with African Americans, Asians, and Latinos. Employing data from Wave 2 of the Baylor Religion Survey, I estimate ordered logit regression models to examine the influence of religious factors on whites’ attitudes toward racial exogamy, net of sociodemographic controls. Analyses reveal that, relative to evangelicals, religiously unaffiliated whites report greater support of intermarriage with all minority groups. Biblical literalists are less likely to support interracial marriage to Asians and Latinos. However, whites who frequently engage in devotional religious practices are more likely to support interracial marriage with all racial groups, as are whites who attend multiracial congregations. My findings suggest that the relationship between religion and whites’ attitudes toward racial exogamy is more complex than previously thought and that the influence of religious practices and congregational composition should not be overlooked.

Abstract = {In this study, late adolescents/early adults whose mothers were living with HIV (MLH) were interviewed in order to explore their perceptions of what it had been like for them to grow up under the shadow of their mothers’ illness. Adolescents were asked to describe what the difficult aspects of growing up with an HIV-positive mother were as well as what, if any, were the more rewarding aspects. Interviews were conducted in 2009-2010 with a random sample of 40 adolescents being followed up in a longitudinal assessment study. All study participants were English or Spanish speaking. Mean age was 18.9 years (SD = 1.9); 67.5% were Latino; 27.5% African- American; and 5% other/multiracial. Results revealed that growing up with an HIV-positive mother had both challenges as well as rewards. On the challenge side, adolescents mentioned six main issues: (1) disappointment regarding mothers’ missing of childhood activities and events; (2) worry about mothers’ health; (3) worry about the possibility of mothers’ death; (4) increased burden of adult responsibilities/caregiving; (5) feelings of secrecy/stigma associated with HIV/AIDS; and (6) need to self-monitor behavior and communication to avoid maternal stress. On the positive side, adolescents mentioned three main rewarding aspects of growing up with an HIV-positive mother: increased closeness in the mother-child relationship; fostering of positive personality traits (e.g., resilience, gratitude, open-mindedness); and "perks" accorded to HIV-affected families.

Abstract = {This study examined the influence of caregiver-reported harsh physical and verbal punishment on children’s behavioral and self-system adjustment. Children’s emotion knowledge was evaluated as a heretofore unrecognized moderator of these relations. We assessed 250 preschool-aged children (50% female; Mage = 49.06 months) from diverse backgrounds (50% Hispanic, 18% African American, 10.4% Caucasian, 21.6% multiracial/other) using various instruments through teacher, caregiver, self, and observer report in the domains of harsh punishment, conduct problems, self-concept, and emotion knowledge. Emotion knowledge moderated the relation between harsh punishment and child adjustment. Harsh physical punishment was associated with conduct problems for children with higher emotion knowledge, especially for boys. Harsh verbal punishment was associated with self-concept deficits among children with higher emotion knowledge, especially for girls. These relations were also specifically applicable to non-Hispanic children. These results highlight the importance of investigating hypothesis-driven interactive effects and the specificity of experience to understand the psychosocial sequelae of parenting practices broadly, and to clarify the mixed evidence in the punishment literature specifically. Clinical implications point to the salience of emotion processes in parent–child disciplinary interventions for understanding the prevalence and pattern of child behavioral adjustment and self-concept, as well as more broadly to the role of individual differences in children’s responses to adversity and subsequent therapeutic needs.

Abstract = {The concept of multiraciality prides itself on the trouble it supposedly causes to the White supremacist rage for order, that is, its ostensible violation of racial discipline and its alleged threat to spurious notions of racial purity. The attention now refocused by the question of race mixture in the present conjuncture around both the pressing matter of racial oppression in America and the tenuous and ambivalent processes of racialisation, provides another opportunity for thinking critically about the production of racialised difference itself. In the wake of the 'biracial baby boom' we are forced to engage, yet again, with the domain of sexuality as a crucial field for the historical invention of race. The emergence of a popular multiracial consciousness in the post-civil rights era in the US contains some critical promise not only for the politics of racial identity per se, but also for sustained reflection on the vicissitudes of desire. We must carefully consider precisely against what multiracial identity asserts its actualisation and its empowerment in its purportedly affirmative moment. Anything less than such a critical double duty can only result in the formation of as yet another 'identical' and hegemonic structure' within the regime of White supremacy.

Abstract = {Latinos are a multiracial ethnic group, and as such, within-group differences in ethnoracial appearance deserve to be studied and understood within the racialized American context and in connection to specific health and mental health outcomes. This article presents the findings of a study conducted with middle school Mexican heritage students (n = 1,150) in Phoenix, Arizona, and tested how non-White majority ethnoracial appearance predicted adolescent substance use, and whether the relationship differed by generation status and strength of ethnic identity. Logistic regression results revealed that generation status and ethnic identity moderate the relationship between ethnoracial appearance and substance use among Mexican heritage youth. The odds of using substances were significantly higher for third-generation adolescents who reported a less European appearance, but significantly lower for second-generation youth who were more indigenous in appearance. These findings indicate that a stronger indigenous ethnic appearance can be both a protective and risk factor for substance use for adolescents. Implications are discussed in terms of incorporating ethnoracial appearance content in prevention interventions for Mexican heritage and other Latino adolescents.

Proportions of participants engaging in UAI one or more times during the past three months were consistent across type of UAI (insertive or receptive) and partner status. Belief that an undetectable viral load reduces infectiousness was significantly associated with insertive UAI (p < .05) and receptive UAI (p < .05) with HIV-negative or unknown status partners and receptive UAI with HIV-positive partners (p < .01). Endorsement of belief in serosorting was significantly associated with receptive UAI (p < .01) and insertive UAI (p < .05) with HIV-positive male partners.

In this book, the authors pick up DuBois well-known and oft-quoted concern about the “color line” and carry it into the current century. The authors have sewn together their story by drawing on insights from both quantitative census-based information about the population and also from in-depth interviews with those living in this new world of the evolving color line. The book itself is divided into three parts. Part I takes up the broad historical and demographic background to the issues forming the diversity paradox. Part II presents new empirical work, much of it based on in-depth interviews with interracial couples and multiracial persons in California. Part III tries to bring the story back together and raise key policy issues. The book’s audience would include a wide range of scholars and policy-oriented readers.

Adolescents included both boys (54%) and girls and were primarily Hispanic (58%), African American (23%), and multiracial (13%). Home-based interviews with both adolescents and caregivers were used to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses and perceived treatment needs. Most adolescents (80%) were diagnosed with multiple disorders and most families (66%) reported a need to treat more than one disorder. Latent class analysis of endorsed DSM-IV disorders identified five distinct diagnostic profiles: Parental Concern, Adolescent Distress, Basic Externalizers, Severely Distressed, and Comorbid Externalizers. Diagnostic profiles were compared on perceived treatment need and related psychosocial risk characteristics.

Abstract = {Racial identification is a complex and dynamic process for multiracial individuals, who as members of multiple racial groups have been shown to self-identify or be identified by others differently, depending on the social context. For biracial individuals who have white and minority ancestry, such identity shifting (e.g., from minority to white, or vice versa) may be a way to cope with the threats to their racial identity that can be signaled by the presence or absence of whites and/or minorities in their social environment. We examine whether stigma consciousness (Pinel in J Pers Soc Psychol 76(1):114–128, 1999; i.e., the chronic awareness of the stereotyping and prejudice that minorities face) interacts with the sociocultural context to predict social identity threat, belonging, and racial identification. Using experience sampling methodology, minority/white biracial individuals (27 Asian/white, 22 black/white, and 26 Latino/white) reported the racial composition of their environment, social identity threat for their component racial identities, overall feelings of belonging, and racial identification over a 1-week period. Results suggest that stigma consciousness predicts the extent to which biracial people identify with their white background and experience belonging in different racial contexts. We discuss racial identity shifting in response to context-based threats as a protective strategy for biracial people, and identity where participants’ sociocultural contexts and experiences with racial identity and threat differ as a result of their minority racial group or ascribed race.

Also, Ss' preferences for alternative racial and ethnic labels that are commonly used to self-identify and classify individuals in the US were investigated. 69 multiracial women (aged 18–44 yrs) who had indicated during a telephone screening interview that one of their parents was Black, Native American, Asian or of Hispanic origin. Findings suggest that Ss' racial identification varied considerably across question formats and that persons of mixed heritage prefer a racial identification question that provides them, at a minimum, with the opportunity to acknowledge their multiracial background. Many respondents also expressed the desire to identify each of the specific groups that constitute their racial/ethnic background. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The relationship among adolescents' (N = 228) ethnic identity, outgroup orientation, and online intergroup experiences was examined across three groups: European Americans, ethnic minorities (i.e., Latino and African Americans), and multiracials. Similar to previous studies, ethnic minorities reported significantly higher ethnic identity than European Americans and multiracials. Although outgroup orientation did not differ among ethnic groups, European Americans reported that they had more online intergroup contact than the other ethnic groups; greater intergroup contact was also related to higher outgroup orientation for this group. These results show that ethnic identity remains stronger for ethnic minorities, but intergroup interaction has become a salient and influential aspect of the online experience for European Americans. Implications are drawn for understanding and improving online and offline intergroup relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Results revealed that high levels of peer association and extrinsic rewards from peer relationships best predicted violence among all groups. Furthermore, among Hispanics, positive peer attitudes toward delinquency significantly contributed to violence. Among Caucasians, greater time spent with peers was associated with higher levels of violence. For African Americans, tangible rewards from peer relationships significantly contributed to violence. No significant results were found among biracial/multiracial female offenders. The findings from this study highlight the significant influence of peer relationships on violence among juvenile offenders and suggest the need for further research on racial and ethnic differences.

Abstract = {This chapter seeks to initiate this effort by analyzing the relationship between racial environments, civic activities, and social ties among America's four major racial groups. Analyzing the Census and survey data, we show that residential segregation presents paradox for the future of race relations in the United States. People in integrated neighborhoods, no matter what their race is, generally have more multiracial friendship and multiracial civic ties. Yet this same integration also seems to retard civic and community involvement. Much of this difference, we suggest, is related to a higher level of social alienation amongst people in integrated settings. People who live in integrated neighborhoods are less socially connected, which may limit their opportunities for involvement in the clubs and associations that could connect them with people of other races. Ironically, the civic life that could be so vital for redressing the challenges of America's growing racial heterogeneity may actually be undermined by the very integration that would be a hallmark of full racial equality. This segregation paradox highlights the significant challenges posed by America's growing racial diversity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

At the same time, clinicians within managed care organizations have less contol over the types of cases that make up their practice. This . . . volume is designed to help practitioners work effectively with diversity in this challenging new environment. It confronts myths and stereotypes about what is considered "normal" and what constitutes a "family," . . . examines a range of healthy families with creative family structures, and expands our notions about how families work.  Synthesizing the current literature with information obtained through 1st-person interviews, the book begins with an overview of contemporary family forms. Chapters then provide an in-depth examination of 3 types of families: adoptive, gay and lesbian, and multiracial. Each is considered first in sociocultural context, then from a developmental perspective, and finally with an eye to treatment implications.  This volume is intended for practitioners, both novice and experienced. Also, for graduate students and trainees . . . , this book serves as [a] text for courses in counseling and clinical psychology, social work, psychiatric nursing, family therapy, and psychiatry.

Abstract = {The present equal opportunity discourse in Australia, with its focus on 'the mainstream woman', i.e. the white Anglo-Celtic woman, overlooks the multiracial feminist perspectives of 'the other woman', the minority ethnic woman. As a result of the intersection of her sexual, ethnic and/or religious identities, 'the other woman' remains dually disadvantaged within Australian society and organizations; largely deprived of the opportunities available to her 'mainstream' sister. This paper discusses the complexity of intersections and of how the interaction of systems of stratification constructs specific social locations for minority ethnic women in Australian organizations. The paper draws on critical race and feminist theories with respect to intersectionality of race and gender, and offers quantitative and qualitative data to exemplify issues that surround representation and (in)equality within Australian organizations. The data include an empirical analysis of complaints filed under the federal legislation over a five-year period to determine how minority ethnic women's workplace experiences differ from those of their mainstream counterparts. The analysis reflects the ongoing nature of multiple discriminations faced by minority ethnic women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the prevalence of negative symptoms and associated factors in older adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorder living in the community. Methods: The sample consisted of a multiracial sample of 198 persons aged 55 and more with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder that developed the disorder before the age of 45; 39% and 61% lived independently and in supported community residences, respectively. George's Social Antecedent Model of Psychopathology was used to examine 16 predictor variables of negative symptoms, based on scores of 4 or more on any of the PANSS negative symptom items. Results: Forty percent of the sample met the criteria for the presence of negative symptoms, and this decreased to 19% when potential secondary symptoms were excluded. In bivariate analysis, 10 variables were found to be significantly associated with the presence of negative symptoms, but when the model was tested in logistic regression analysis, only 3 variables retained significance: greater positive symptom scores (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26), lower cognitive scores (OR = 0.96), and fewer confidantes (OR = 0.80). Conclusion: Negative symptoms do not dominate the clinical picture in later life, and levels of negative symptoms appear to be no higher than in younger schizophrenia populations. The relative paucity of significant variables and their modest effect sizes suggest that treatment for negative symptoms in later life will depend largely on strategies directed specifically at the negative symptoms.

Abstract = {The year 2000 brought with it many advances and a renewed hope for the future. With this new decade came the first time that those with multiracial and multiethnic backgrounds could identify the full range of their racial and ethnic backgrounds.The creation of this new category is a departure from the 2000 census and a further recognition of this growing population. The change in the U.S. population is due in part to the growth in the some other race group. The two or more race group grew from 6,826,228 in 2000 to 9,009,073. This is a growth rate of 32% and suggests that counselors need to be prepared to work with the members of this growing population and be able to meet their unique cultural needs. Focusing on only meeting the cultural needs of the dominant racial and ethnic groups has left this group to largely fend for themselves resulting in an exacerbation of their struggles. The challenges of constructing a comprehensive developmental theory that could help counselors and other helping professionals provide effective services to this population has been challenging and has undergone many changes over the decades. This chapter focuses on an identity development theory that can help counselors who work with multiple heritage individuals and their families and couples and their families. The multiple heritage identity development model (MHID) provides a framework for understanding the complexity of the identity development process and a means for identifying and developing ways to help multiple heritage individuals with the identity development process.

Abstract = {The majority of research on skin color and colorism (internalized, intraracial skin-tone bias) has focused on African descended people, including African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans, more research has emerged exploring issues of colorism among Latinos, people of Arab descent, Asians, South Asians, Asian Americans, and multiracial people. Overall, colorism research paints a clear picture of the impacts that variance in skin color can have on life course and life outcomes. Researchers have extensively examined the impact of colorism on the adult life course with a special focus on women. In particular, research points to the manners in which colorism among African American women and Latinas impacts self-concept, mate choice, social mobility, and employment status. Popular media directed toward women regularly explores this issue via annual stories on how colorism is manifested among women of color. This chapter explores the socialization process of colorism and its subsequent impact on the mental and behavioral health of African American and Latina adolescent girls, paying particular attention to health outcomes and psychological well-being. Mental disorders including anxiety, depression, and behavioral problems—as well as the protective factors associated with socialization in response to colorism and issues related to skin color—are explored and discussed via a review of the current and historical literature. It is important to note the limited literature in the area of colorism and youth. This may be in part a result of the great emotion and pain associated with the topic by people of color, including youth. Therefore this chapter incorporates the larger body of research in the thesis and dissertation literature with recent empirical studies from seasoned researchers to provide the fullest picture of current research on colorism and adolescent girls of color.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Creating a New Racial Order: How Immigration, Multiracialism, Genomics, and the Young Can Remake Race in America by Jennifer L. Hochschild, Vesla M. Weaver, and Traci R. Burch (2012). Non-Hispanic white births are no longer the majority in the United States, marking a milestone that demographers had long projected due to continued immigration from Latin America and Asia, along with a growing multiracial population. Not only are we more diverse than at any point in our history, but young Americans are growing up in a country in which Barack Obama was elected president, the gaps in education among racial and ethnic groups are narrowing, heterogeneity within groups is increasing, and genomics are transforming the very meaning of race. These changes are transforming what Hochschild, VesWeaver, and Burch refer to as “the American racial order,” which this book defines as “the widely understood and accepted system of beliefs, laws, practices that organize relationships among groups de fined as races or ethnicities.” The authors point to four main vehicles that are driving the change: immigration, multiracialism, genomics, and cohort change. Creating a New Racial Order is necessary reading that will easily find a place on syllabi for this and the next generation, to whom they dedicate the book, and on whom they are counting to work for a better racial future.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Diverse Millennial Students in College: Implications for Faculty and Student Affairs by Fred A. Bonner II, Aretha F. Marbley, and Mary F. Howard-Hamilton (Eds.) (2011). The term Millennial is often used to describe the cohort born in the early 1980s to late 1990s many of whom entered college following the year 2000. As numerous authors in this edited book point out, the very attempt to use a single term to capture an entire generation of students is inherently inadequate, given the vast diversity of the student population. Furthermore, the images and trends evoked by the Millennial label can fall short in showcasing the range of experiences between and within key student sub-populations. This edited volume seeks to remedy some of these issues by providing a more complex and nuanced depiction of the diversity of the Millennial generation. Chapter 1 discusses assumptions about Millennial. Chapters 2 and 3 provide two perspectives on Black Millennial students. Chapters 4 and 5 address facets of experiences related to Asian American and Pacific Islander Millennials, although the chapters focus more on Asian American rather than Pacific Islander students. In chapter 6, the authors use data from the UCLA Higher Education Research Institute's Cooperative Institutional Research Program to compare cohorts of Latino/a Millennials over the generations. Chapter 10 overviews key issues related to LGBTQ Millenials. Chapter 13 focuses more specifically on how different Millennial traits may manifest themselves among multiracial students, as well as the issues of peer culture, identity politics, and academic interests.

Abstract = {The demography of public school enrollment continues to change dramatically, with students of color comprising an increasing proportion of the whole. As such, suburbia, with both White and non-White students, is a place in which integration is more possible in the beginning of the 21st century. Due to the intertwined nature of how these factors affect educational politics in suburban districts, we draw on Hirschman’s exit-voice-loyalty framework to examine factors influencing residential and education decisions. Drawing on in-depth fieldwork in seven multiracial suburban districts, this article examines how, and whether, the way in which districts define issues related to increasing diversity shapes the actions they take. The article also examines how district jurisdiction affects the implementation of diversity policies as well as the policies themselves. We argue that policymakers’ decision making, both due to the pressure of exit to less diverse suburban districts and the rising voices of more advantaged residents in the suburban marketplace, has increased inequality within districts, particularly those that we call “multimunicipal,” or districts with multiple, disparate municipalities within the district.

Abstract = {With cumulative worldwide grosses of more than $1 billion, the Ocean's series can be said to constitute part of popular cinema's Zeitgeist in the early 2000s. The films emblematize a particular cultural sensibility, a neoretro sensibility that takes shape through textual characteristics, engages with generic and cultural codes of past eras, and finds further expression in subsequent popular texts. Ocean's Eleven articulates this sensibility particularly through its multiple investments in contemporary formations of masculinity. The film's neoretro attitudes create a space for the multiracial male group, a group defined by style codes and casual as well as highly formalized homosocial interactions. My analysis here concentrates on Ocean's Eleven, the most critically successful of the series as well as the most straightforward in terms of narrative arcs, intersecting subplots, and overall integration of an ensemble cast into a single story line. Still, the three films together demonstrate reasonable consistency in their narrative dynamics, characterizations, and overall textual attitudes. In Ocean's Eleven, paroled criminal Danny Ocean (George Clooney) assembles a team for an elaborate Las Vegas casino robbery, motivated in part by his desire to reclaim his estranged wife, Tess (Julia Roberts), now romantically involved with the casino's owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Ocean and his team achieve both goals, setting up Ocean's Twelve, in which Benedict tracks them down and demands repayment. The group relocates to Europe for heists, intrigue, romance, and myriad narrative complications amid Dutch, Italian, and other continental scenery. In a narrative overflowing with characters and plots, Ocean's Twelve pits its team against not only Benedict but also aristocratic robber Francois Touleur, known as "the Night Fox" (Vincent Cassel), and introduces the additional con artists and thieves. For this operation, the team enlists Benedict's backing, cons Bank's aide Abigail Sponder (Ellen Barkin), and again fends off the persistent Touleur. All three films showcase male performance, with arch role-playing and subterfuge in abundance. While I focus on this series and its first outing in particular, numerous other contemporary heist films offer close variations on the Ocean's films' models of male engagement, as I address in some detail below.

Abstract = {Singapore is a tiny island nation tucked between the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia in Southeast Asia. Approximately 712.4 square kilometers (275 square miles) in land area, it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. It is a multiracial and multilingual nation of 5 million people in which approximately 77% of the population is Chinese, 13% is Malay, 9% is Indian, and 1 in 3 workers is a foreigner The name Singapore, which means "Lion City," was derived from the native language, Malay. There are four official languages: English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. However, English is the official language of business, administration, and education. In 2011, Singapore ranked among the top 10 wealthiest nations in the world (Forbes Blogger, 2011). A former British colony, Singapore has retained several aspects of British social and political structure, including a parliamentary government and an educational system that relies on high-stakes examinations to determine secondary and postsecondary placements. Education has always been a national priority in Singapore, which is recognized for having one of the best educational systems in the world (McKinsey & Company, 2007). The government invests heavily in technology and education with the aim of developing the nation as a regional hub for finance, education, and technology. Counseling services in Singapore began in the 1960s when a group of Christian professionals formed the Churches Counseling Service, directed by an American Methodist pastor. Reverend Gurmer Teilmann. In those early years, counseling was a term loosely applied to helping services provided by individuals who assumed various roles. Following the establishment of this center, counseling services were developed at social welfare agencies, religious institutions, military establishments, hospitals, schools, and other government institutions. Today counseling in Singapore is defined as a collaborative process in which a counselor or psychologist works collaboratively with people to expand their view of life and develop their abilities to cope and make choices for change in themselves, the situation, and the environment without destructive consequences to self or others (Yeo, 1993). In this chapter counseling is contextualized in terms of diverse cultural and sociopolitical challenges in this country. The chapter concludes with a discussion of future challenges and opportunities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {As we enter the second decade of the twenty-first century, education in America is at a critical turning point. Call for reform is widespread and exemplified by the documentary film Waiting for Superman, which highlights the fact that for many American children, access to a quality education is often literally a lottery. Equal access to educational opportunity is the philosophical cornerstone of the American public education system. Although significant advances towards realizing this goal have been made over recent decades, educational quality still varies widely, with Latino and African-American children being more likely to attend disadvantaged schools (Cauce, Cruz, Corona, & Conger, 2011). The agents of this inequity are familiar to most in disadvantaged educational environments: educator stress, low academic expectations, and impaired relations with students; ecological instability; and a culture that discourages academic achievement and healthy behavior—as well as a host of other circumstances that demand the attention of students and educators al the expense of learning. While years of policy initiatives have worked to eliminate these problems, the future of American public education and its ability lo produce a skilled workforce capable of competing in an increasingly challenging and technical global market remains uncertain (Education in America, 2010). One certainty regarding the future American workforce, however, will be its multiracial and multiethnic composition. By the year 2050, roughly 47% of working Americans will be members of a racial/ethnic minority group. Of these, approximately 24% will be Latino (Toosi, 2006). Latinos (or Hispanics) are individuals of "Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race" (Office of Management and Budget (0MB), 1997). Currently, Latinos are the largest ethnic minority group in the U.S., accounting for 15% of the U.S. population. In addition to being the largest minority group, Latinos are the youngest group, with one-in-five U.S. school children being of Latino descent and one-in-four newborns being born lo Latina mothers (Pew Hispanic Center, 2009).

Abstract = {Because sexual behavior may be associated with a broader range of outcomes than physical consequences like sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, it is important to understand consequences of sex that may influence mental and social well-being in emerging adulthood. This article describes the short-term intrapersonal and interpersonal consequences reported by college students on days they engage in vaginal sex and what factors predict experiencing particular consequences. Data are from first-year college students who reported vaginal sex on at least one of 28 sampled days (mean age = 18.5 years; 53% female; 30% Hispanic/Latino [HL]; of non-HL participants, 30% were African American, 22% were Asian American, 35% were European American, and 12% were multiracial; N = 209 people and N = 679 person days). Participants reported positive consequences more frequently than negative consequences. Non-use of contraception and sex with a non-dating partner were associated with greater odds of reporting negative consequences. These findings have implications for messages about casual sex and use of contraception in sex education and sexual health programming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined relationships between neighborhood poverty and allostatic load in a low- to moderate-income multiracial urban community. We tested the hypothesis that neighborhood poverty is associated with allostatic load, controlling for household poverty. We also examined the hypotheses that this association was mediated by psychosocial stress and health-related behaviors. Methods: We conducted multilevel analyses using cross-sectional data from a probability sample survey in Detroit, Michigan (n = 919) and the 2000 US Census. The outcome measure was allostatic load. Independent variables included neighborhood and household poverty, psychosocial stress, and health-related behaviors. Covariates included neighborhood and individual demographic characteristics. Results: Neighborhood poverty was positively associated with allostatic load (P < .05), independent of household poverty and controlling for potential confounders. Relationships between neighborhood poverty were mediated by self-reported neighborhood environment stress but not by health-related behaviors. Conclusions: Neighborhood poverty is associated with wear and tear on physiological systems, and this relationship is mediated through psychosocial stress. These relationships are evident after accounting for household poverty levels. Efforts to promote health equity should focus on neighborhood poverty, associated stressful environmental conditions, and household poverty.

Abstract = {In a multiracial and multilingual society where bilingualism is adopted as the cornerstone of education policy, mother tongue maintenance is a significant issue. An innovative initiative termed as modular curriculum was introduced in Singapore primary schools to cater to Chinese students, the major ethnic group, with varying Chinese language proficiencies. Surveys with teachers (N=107) found positive correlations of the modular curriculum, but negative correlations of traditional Chinese teaching, with support for oral communicative skills and the use of technology. Analysis of variance found that teachers with longer experiences of the modular curriculum were less inclined to using traditional approaches. The findings may serve as empirical evidence to help policy-makers consider teachers' needs and set proper pace for implementing the new curriculum with adequate support for both pre-service and in-service teacher training.

Abstract = {Recent studies of wage inequality show that there are many similarities between Brazil and other multiracial countries. The present research adds to this literature by examining wage differentials between white and Japanese-Brazilian males ages 18 to 64 in the state of Sao Paulo. Data are from the 0.8 percent sample of the 1980 Brazilian census. The effects of labor force experience, schooling, class of worker, location, and background characteristics on earnings are estimated separately for white and Japanese wage earners. Subsequently, the wage gap is decomposed into unexplained, composition, and interaction components. The data show that the average wage for Japanese-Brazilians is 61 percent higher than for whites and that 74 percent of this disparity is explained by differences in the means of the independent variables (composition). Compared to whites, Japanese-Brazilians are better educated and are more likely to be employers or self-employed. In addition, ambition, persistence, deferred gratification, and intergenerational mobility—characteristics associated with Asian attainment in the United States—provide a plausible explanation for the 22 percent of the earnings differential that is "unexplained." This research suggests that the socioeconomic achievements of people of Japanese descent in Brazil surpass those of the white majority as has been the case in other multiracial countries.

This study aims to observe the effects of penetrating segregated spaces within the catering halls of two student residences at a multiracial university in South Africa. Research confederates were deployed to infiltrate specific tables usually occupied by either black or white occupants. The effects of same-race and cross-race infiltration were observed across ten different conditions comprising variations in race and number of confederates. Descriptive analysis revealed a highly ordered spatial organisation of black and white seating patterns. In both dining halls, cross-race infiltration with a racially homogeneous group of confederates had the most notable effects on black and white students' reactions to infiltration. Persistent re-segregation and the use of space as a means of reinstating racial boundaries between black and white students are discussed.

This article examines the impact that a heightened awareness of race as a social construct has on the relationship between racial stereotypes and performance. Study 1 finds that multiracial individuals reported subscribing less to the notion that race biologically determines ability. Study 2 finds that monoracial individuals show stereotype activation, whereas multiracial individuals show stereotype inhibition in reaction to race salience. Study 3 draws on the work on stereotypes and performance to test the susceptibility of multiracial individuals to racial stereotypes about ability. The authors find that Asian/White and Black/White multiracial individuals were less susceptible to racial stereotypes than monoracial individuals. Whereas monoracial participants showed significant performance changes in reaction to race salience, multiracial individuals did not. Study 4 finds that emphasizing the social construction of race buffers individuals from stereotype threat effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In 1903, W.E.B. Du Bois prophesied that the "problem of the twentieth-century is the problem of the color line," by which he meant the tenacious black-white divide that has long characterized the nature of race relations in the United States ([1903] 1997: 45). Nearly a century later, Herbert J. Gans speculated the traditional black-white fault line may soon be replaced by a black-nonblack divide that may be qualitatively different from the black-white divide, but is hardly new for blacks, who are likely to remain at the bottom of America's racial hierarchy. Taking into account the new racial and ethnic diversity of the United States brought about by contemporary immigration, we examine patterns of intermarriage and multiracial identification to assess where color lines are fading most rapidly and where they continue to endure. We adjudicate whether a black-white divide remains the most salient, whether a Hispanic-Anglo divide is imminent, or whether a black-nonblack fault line is emerging, as Gans forecasts.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Special Populations in College Counseling: A Handbook for Mental Health Professionals by Joseph A. Lippincott and Ruth B. Lippincott (see record [rid]2007-00581-000[/rid]). According to McCarthy, this handbook is a collection of articles that addresses diversity. The chapters are organized into specific sections, including assessment issues, counseling implications, campus considerations, and future trends. Appendices are provided in some chapters, providing material such as websites on diverse religious groups, a glossary for alternative sexual identities, a diagram for counseling office design for mobility-impaired students, and charts on identity development in multiracial-mixed race students and on reentry culture shock concerns. The listing of chapters are: (a) identity issues (veterans, athletes, spiritual diversity, transgender students); (b) culture, ethnicity, class, and age issues ("third culture," multiracial, blue collar, adult learners); (c) developmental and situational issues (relationship violence, sexual assault, mandated students, problem drinkers, academic jeopardy, grief); and (d) medical, physical, and severe psychological issues (mobility impairment, visual impairment, deafness, chronic or life-threatening illness, learning disabilities, autism or Asperger's syndrome, severe psychiatric disorders, and self-injurious behavior). A solid reference section concludes each chapter so that readers can explore topics in more detail. McCarthy recommends the book. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Pollock and Van Reken (1999) defined the third-culture kid (TCK) as a person who has spent a significant part of his or her developmental years outside the parents' culture. The TCK builds relationships to all of the cultures, while not having full ownership in any. Although elements from each culture are assimilated into the TCK's life experience, the sense of belonging is in relationship to others of a similar background, (p. 19). The third culture is the intersection between the parents' culture, the student's passport culture if not the same as the parents', and the intercultural environment in which the student develops. The result is a dynamic sense of cultural space, marked by mobility, multiculturalism, and marginality--an interstitial cultural milieu. Being in between cultures is an experience shared by the TCKs, and, thus, the community of the third culture emerges. The TCKs' parents are usually expatriates, or "expats," living for an extensive number of years "abroad," outside of their passport country. They are also frequently "global nomads," moving from one job assignment to another, from one country to another. The TCK constituency therefore includes the children of missionaries, relief agency workers, educators, Fulbrighters, corporate and entrepreneurial business professionals, and government personnel (civilian, military, and diplomatic corps). The TCK community is represented by nearly every nationality. Together, these TCKs share an experience that binds them as a multiethnic, multiracial, and multireligious group--the experience of growing up outside their passport countries in an ever-fluid multicultural and international community. This chapter discusses TCKs from the United States, although what is stated within this chapter is applicable to Singaporean TCKs, Dutch TCKs, Indian TCKs, Japanese TCKs, or Moroccan TCKs, within the contexts of their experiences. In addition, this chapter focuses on the college student population of TCKs and, more specifically, the mental health issues related to this experience. The TCK college student population is special for several important clinical as well as humanistic reasons. TCKs often return to a home culture with which they never have truly affiliated despite looking like they should fit in. This "out of placeness" can be deeply troubling for returnees and for the nonreturnees around them. Reentry, or reverse, culture shock is actually more challenging and disruptive than initial culture shock, affecting the returnee's academic, social, and personal functioning. Identity and social development issues are significant because the TCK's role models are no longer immediately available. Social support is limited for most TCKs because campuses have often failed to recognize TCKs as a uniquely defined student population and have therefore provided little to no systemic support. The mental health professional has often conceptualized reentry culture shock as a clinical syndrome rather than a developmental experience and, as such, has identified deficits rather than strengths and opportunities. Finally, some 37,000 TCKs return to the United States ever)7 year for college (Gaw, 2000). This is not a small group of entering students but a very real multicultural population. In fact, some institutions, such as Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon, specifically recruit TCKs, seeing them as valuable contributors to the campus community.

Abstract = {Many concerns exist for multiracial children with regard to their racial identity development. These factors are even more complex in a culturally insensitive environment, such as a school. This incident relates the case of a young boy whose identity development journey led him to be inappropriately diagnosed. The expert respondents offer insight into appropriate intervention using reality theory and systemic consultation. "Gerald Collins," a 10-year-old biracial child whose mother was Caucasian and whose father was African American, lived in a predominantly African American community. Gerald was an only child. His mother was a homemaker, and his father was in the Army Reserves. The family had lived in the community for 2 years. In the neighborhood, there were two other bicultural families. Each of the families had one biracial child who had at least two other single-race siblings. Gerald's school was racially mixed, with African American students accounting for approximately 50% of the student population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Self-report data pertaining to Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI; e.g., cutting) were collected from 5,691 undergraduates at a Midwestern urban university. Consistent with the small literature on NSSI among college students, 12.8% of the sample indicated having engaged in NSSI at least once (3.4% in the past year). Women and younger students were at slightly higher risk. Important ethnic differences were found, as Caucasians and individuals self-identifying as Multiracial were at especially high risk for a history of NSSI, whereas Arab Americans and African Americans had particularly low rates. Further, links between NSSI and religion were found, such that participants with stronger self-reported religious convictions had the lowest rates of NSSI. Those who self-described as Atheist, Agnostic, or Nonbeliever were several times more likely to have engaged in NSSI (31.3%), while Muslims (7.4%) and Baptists (6.3%) had relatively low rates. Multivariate analyses revealed that ethnic differences in NSSI could not be accounted for by religious differences. Processes that may explain the associations between NSSI and ethnic affiliation and religion are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) account for two-thirds of new HIV infections in young people in the United States. Identifying between-person and within-person correlates of sexual risk-taking provides critical information for developing behavioral prevention efforts for this group. Possible predictors of sexual-risk behavior in YMSM include major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and variation in psychological distress over time. To date, research has been equivocal with regard to the relationship between psychiatric disorders, psychological distress, and sexual risk behaviors. Participants included 119 16-20-year-old YMSM. Ethnicity/race of the participants included: black/African-American (46.2%), white (19.3%), Latino/Hispanic (12.6%), multiracial (11.8%), Asian/Pacific Islander (2.5%), and other (5.9%). Sexual risk outcomes included total number of male partners and unprotected anal sex acts across four waves of data collection (24 months). The study found that the between-person correlates, including ethnicity and age, predicted total male partners. Between-person correlates, including ethnicity, MDD, and a moderating effect of PTSD on psychological distress emerged as determinants of unprotected anal sex acts.

Its mode is free associative, mirroring the act of remembering.

Abstract = {Purpose: This study examined the association between children’s emotion regulatory processes and parents’ emotional problems. Design: A 5-year longitudinal study of families from Northwestern United States with data collected over 3 time points. Families were recruited in an effort to oversample for multiracial and African American families because these families have historically not been well represented in research studies. Method: Parental hostility characteristics and subclinical levels of depression were assessed in combination with teachers’ reports of children’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Ninety-one families with married parents and an elementary school-aged child participated in the study. Findings: There was a significant main effect for the association between fathers’ self-reports of hostility and teacher reports of children’s externalizing behaviors. Neither parental hostility nor depressive symptoms were significantly associated with the children’s internalizing behaviors. Conclusion: The results suggest that children’s externalizing behaviors are associated with their fathers’ dysregulated expression of hostility. Clinical Relevance: Parent-child interactions are a key component of children’s emotion regulation development. Our findings may guide health care professionals in identifying and intervening in parental behaviors, particularly fathers’ behaviors, that may adversely affect the healthy emotional development of their children.

Abstract = {Reactions to individuals who possess features associated with multiple racial groups may be particularly susceptible to external contextual influences, leading to meaningfully different racial perceptions and judgments in different situations. In the present study, we found that an extrinsic race-label cue not only changed evaluative associations activated by a racially ambiguous face, but also changed quickly occurring neural responses sensitive to racial perception. Behaviorally, prototypical Black faces and racially ambiguous faces labeled as Black activated more negative implicit associations than prototypical White faces and racially ambiguous faces labeled as White. Neurally, prototypical faces and racially ambiguous faces cued with the same race elicited similar responses. Specifically, prototypical Black and racially ambiguous faces labeled as Black elicited larger P200s but smaller N200s than prototypical White and racially ambiguous faces labeled as White. These results show that racial perception can be changed by an external cue and this, in turn, influences subsequent evaluative reactions.

Previous research has documented that White perceivers’ negative evaluation of one Black person leads to a negative implicit evaluation of another Black person belonging to the same minimal group. We built upon this out-group transfer effect by investigating whether perceivers also transferred negative implicit attitudes from one Black person to a novel Black–White biracial person. In three experiments, participants learned about a Black individual who performed undesirable behaviors and were then introduced to a new group member. White perceivers formed negative attitudes toward the original individual and transferred these attitudes to the new group member if she was Black or Biracial, but not if she was White (Experiment 1) or Asian (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 demonstrated that only White participants exhibited transfer to the new Black and Biracial group members; Black participants did not.

PIU was assessed in a sample of 1,470 college students (62.9 percent female, 37.1 percent male; Mage = 19.13 years [SD = 1.49]; 46.1 percent Asian, 28.2 percent Hispanic, 16.3 percent White, 5.9 percent Black, and 3.5 percent Multiracial/Other) who participated in a larger study of young adult adaptation, which included measures of child maltreatment, alexithymia, self-concept, social support, and psychopathology. Males and Asian students endorsed higher levels of PIU than females and other ethnoracial groups, respectively. PIU was related to contemporaneous maladaptation in the form of decreased self-concept, lower social support, and increased psychopathology across groups. Experiences of child maltreatment were related to increased PIU, and mediation analyses showed that this relation was partially explained by alexithymia. These relations were comparable across males and females and between Asian and non-Asian respondents. The analyses provide evidence for the significant role of child maltreatment and the cognitive-affective deficits it precipitates in understanding pathways toward PIU in young adulthood. Our findings suggest that maltreated youth are at disproportionate risk for PIU, and their capacities to regulate and process emotion are important targets for prevention and therapeutic intervention.

Combining years of counselling skill with a natural compassion, she makes the subject of racism approachable, thus motivating all those wanting to explore the issues.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Mixing Races: From Scientific Racism to Modern Evolutionary Ideas by Paul Lawrence Farber (see record [rid]2011-16356-000[/rid]). Mixing Races: From Scientific Racism to Modern Evolutionary Ideas, by Paul Lawrence Farber, is first a history of how scientific developments influenced attitudes about race and race mixing and then how changing attitudes were reflected on college campuses. This book is not for those interested in a discussion of the history of multiracial identity or politics. It is appropriate for scholars, including psychologists, focused on critical race theory. For such scholars, it provides a succinct, well organized review of 20th-century scientific research and thinking relevant to notions of race that may assist in our understanding of many of the racial issues that we continue to face as a nation. However, the book’s specific focus on the changing dynamics and response to interracial relationships on college campuses makes it too narrow for me to recommend it more broadly. The author provides suggestions for further reading that will be helpful to those who desire more information on the topics summarized in the book.

Abstract = {This paper seeks to make meaning of the experience of being white in the United States at this point in history. The self-awareness of white people is limited by a blind spot around the meaning and impact of being white in a multiracial society. Using psychoanalytic and literary methodology, the author seeks to cast light with which to explore this blind spot. Everyday experiences are used to illustrate the widely pervasive impact of race in the lives of white people, and a clinical vignette illustrates how race might show up in a white-on-white psychotherapy.

The variation in these parental designations of a variety of mixed-race children is described. Parental racial designations in the three most common majority-minority interracial couplings - White/Hispanic, Black/White and Asian/White - are predicted using multinomial logistic regression models. The results may indicate a movement by the parents of these multiracial children away from minority status through racial labeling and towards "multiracial" and "White" - movements that are predicated upon gender, class and context.

Abstract = {The objective of this mixed methods study was to examine current sexual risk behaviors, acceptability and potential adoption of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, and sexual behavior intentions with PrEP adoption among HIV-negative gay and bisexual men (GBM) in HIV serodiscordant relationships. A multiracial/ethnic sample of 25 HIV-negative GBM in serodiscordant relationships completed a qualitative interview and a brief interviewer-administered survey. A modified grounded theory approach was used to identify key themes relating to acceptability and future adoption of PrEP. Participants reported engaging in sexual risk behaviors that place them at risk for HIV infection. Participants also reported a high level of acceptability for PrEP and willingness to adopt PrEP for HIV prevention. Qualitative themes explaining future PrEP adoption included: (1) the opportunity to engage in sex using a noncondom HIV prevention method, (2) protection from HIV infection, and (3) less anxiety when engaging in sex with an HIV-positive partner. Associated with the future adoption of PrEP, a majority (64%) of participants indicated the likelihood for an increase in sexual risk behaviors and a majority (60%) of participants also indicated the likelihood for a decrease or abandonment of condom use, both of which are in contrast to the findings from the large iPrEx study. These findings suggest that the use of PrEP by HIV-negative GBM in serodiscordant relationships carries with it the potential for risk compensation. The findings suggest that PrEP only be offered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy that includes ongoing risk reduction counseling in the delivery of PrEP to help moderate risk compensation.

Abstract = {The counseling literature has developed a small but growing amount of work specific to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) couples and families with multiple cultural identities, but most of the focus has been on heterosexism, sexism, and challenging racism. For some clients, issues of citizenship and immigration are more salient, yet there is little counseling literature devoted to the issues of immigrationism (i.e., prejudice multiplied by power that is used by persons of dominant citizenship statuses to restrict access to individual, cultural, and systemic resources by noncitizens in a particular country; Chen-Hayes, 2009). Counselors can use additional information in working with same-gender couples and families facing issues of migration and immigration in a world in which only 12 nations currently offer same-gender marriage at the federal level and several dozen others offer some form of either civil union or domestic partnership status in all or part of their nations.

Abstract = {Roberto was a 52-year-old gay divorced Chicano with joint custody of his 13-year-old multiracial African American and Mexican daughter Maya, who lived with him and his new boyfriend Conrad, a Chinese American from Hong Kong who had recently moved in. Roberto had identified as gay ever since he had left his 20-year marriage and come out at age 42. He was on good terms with his ex-wife Shaniqua; they had joint custody of Maya and lived one neighborhood away from each other. Both Roberto and Shaniqua were recovering alcoholics. Roberto and Shaniqua both agreed that counseling would be helpful and signed the consent form for 13-year-old Maya to receive treatment. The presenting issue was that a teacher had called Roberto stating that she had caught Maya drinking at an eighth-grade dance party. Roberto talked to Shaniqua, Conrad, and Shaniqua's husband Ray to brainstorm what they should do and to present a united front to Maya. Everyone agreed that it would be important to go to counseling to support Maya and "nip this in the bud," as Roberto framed it. The adults were all concerned that Maya could repeat her parents' alcoholism patterns, and they sought counseling for her to ensure that this would not occur. They sought a family counselor with a background in addictions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Why do Black parents choose to send their children to predominantly White private schools, and what are the experiences of their children in these schools? In the early 1980s, Slaughter and Schneider framed these questions for the first time in the history of educational research. Anderson School was one of four private schools studied intensively from the perspective of how it addressed the concepts of race and class as mirrored in school identity. In particular, parental educational goals, school administrative leadership style, teacher classroom practice, and family engagement were studied, particularly as these themes appeared to impact, and be impacted by, race and class. In the 1980s, Anderson School was unusual, existing as an open-education, child-centered, multiracial (50% Black), small, private alternative educational institution in Chicago, Illinois. To date, administrative school leadership at Anderson has been White and female. This chapter focuses on how Anderson's overall school leadership, including directors, teachers, parent leaders, and parents addressed race and social class issues between 1983 and 1994. In this chapter, the author focuses on two time periods, 1983-84, and 1994. When she addresses the findings of the original 1983-84 ethnographic study, and the 1994 follow-up, she links them to U.S. culture and schools as educational institutions during that time period, 1983-94.

Abstract = {This chapter discusses the development of psychology and its various branches in Brunei Darussalam. Brunei Darussalam is an independent Islamic Sultanate located in the northern part of Borneo in Southeast Asia. Brunei is a multiracial and multicultural society with unique sociocultural beliefs. The main domain of the culture is deeply entrenched in Malay, Islam, and monarchy (Melayu, Islam, Reraja or MIB). The development of psychology as a subject and specialty is still at an early stage. Historically, educational psychology, guidance and counselling, and special education are the branches of psychology that are first to emerge, followed by clinical psychology. For the past 20 years, interest in psychology and its related branches has improved. In Brunei, the development of the field of psychology is closely related to rapid development of the economy after independence in 1984, specifically due to the rapid progress made at the Ministry of Education, the University of Brunei, the Ministry of Health, various government agencies and departments, and nongovernmental voluntary organizations. Currently, there is a positive acceptance of the role of psychology, counseling, special education, educational psychology, and clinical psychology by the government and society at large. Therefore, psychology has bright prospect of developing and expanding its role and impact on society. This chapter discusses various aspects of how psychology developed in Brunei, and suggestions are made for future development of psychology.

Abstract = {Purpose in adolescence is linked to positive developmental outcomes, and yet little is known about how youth purpose is supported by people and institutions that occupy the ecologies in which young people are embedded. Little is known too about how African-American youths envision themselves in the future, and understanding the nature of their purposes may uncover critical information about these adolescents’ aspirations. Associations between purpose and social supports were examined in a sample of 46 adolescent girls in the southeastern United States (Mean age = 12.83 years; SD = 1.14 years) (African-American/Black = 78.3%; Multiracial = 15.2%; White/Caucasian = 6.5%). Qualitative content analysis of interviews identified five forms of purpose experienced by these young people. Surveys measured perceived presence and importance of social supports of parents, teachers, close friends, classmates, and school environment, as well as emotional, informational, appraisal, and instrumental support across these sources. Adolescents with more diffuse purpose forms reported greater social support from school, and in some cases, from teachers, than did adolescents with more complete purpose forms. The diffuse purpose form groups reported that school support was more important to them than did the other groups. Implications of the findings are discussed.

Abstract = {Minority-race children in North America and Europe often show less own-race favoritism than children of the majority (White) race, but the reasons for this asymmetry are unresolved. The present research tested South African children in order to probe the influences of group size, familiarity, and social status on children’s race-based social preferences. We assessed South African children’s preferences for members of their country’s majority race (Blacks) compared to members of other groups, including Whites, who ruled South Africa until 1994 and who remain high in status. Black children (3–13 years) tested in a Black township preferred people of their own gender but not race. Moreover, Black, White, and multiracial children (4–9 years) tested in a racially diverse primary school showed in-group bias by gender but not by race: all favored people who were White. Relative familiarity and numerical majority ⁄ minority status therefore do not fully account for children’s racial attitudes, which vary with the relative social status of different racial groups.

Abstract = {This study presents a measure of “cultural homelessness” (Vivero & Jenkins, 1999), a construct developed to explain the experiences of some individuals having early-life immersion in more than one culture. Culturally homeless individuals report pervasive experiences of “being different”: mixed racial, ethnic, and/or cultural heritages within their families of origin and/or between their families and the surrounding sociocultural context, resulting in structural marginality; repeated subjection to contradictory cultural demands; and the acquisition of conflicting frames of reference for their behavior. Ambiguous physical presentation and the complexity of codeswitching across multiple cultural frames of reference at a young age may lead to confused or inappropriate social behavior, resulting in rejection and discrimination by both minority and majority groups, chronic feelings of “not belonging,” self-blame and shame, social and emotional isolation, cultural identity confusion, and the desire to find a “cultural home.” Empirical findings operationalizing this construct show associations of cultural homelessness criteria with gender; risk factors related to multiracial, multiethnic, and multicultural status; ethnic identity; and self esteem.

However, reclaiming best practices is a challenge given the genocidal policies that outlawed Native culture Despite this challenge Native people have proven resilient in restoring culture. The Native American Health Center in Oakland, California, has made cultural interventions an option for an urban, intertribal and sometimes multiracial Native American population to create and maintain their health on a spiritual, emotional, mental and physical level Nevertheless, sustaining these cultural options to maintain health continues to be a challenge While the passage of the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) in 2004 in California to transform treatment of mental and behavioral health "as we know it" would seem to create a gateway for cultural options, mainstream mental health has a hard time perceiving cultural interventions as a viable means to treat mental illness and maintain wellness. Frequently, the author has attended meetings of decisionmaking bodies that oversee how MHSA money is spent and someone will blurt out after someone has described an innovative cultural intervention "What does that have to do with mental illness?"

The present longitudinal study examined both the transition and timing of menarche on the trajectory of anxiety in girls with histories of childhood maltreatment (N = 93; 63% European American, 14% multiracial, 10% Latino, 9% African American, and 4% Native American). We hypothesized that because menarche is a novel, unfamiliar experience, girls would show greater anxiety around the time of menarche. The anxiety-provoking nature of menarche may be accentuated among earlier-maturing girls and girls with histories of childhood sexual abuse. Results indicated that earlier-maturing girls were more anxious in the pre- and peri-menarche periods than their later-maturing peers; however, their anxiety declined after menarche. Childhood sexual abuse was associated with heightened anxiety throughout this transition. The developmental significance of the timing and transition of menarche in relation to childhood sexual abuse and anxiety is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

In Study 1, an exploratory principal-components analyses (n = 443) yielded a 6-factor model: (a) Assumptions of Inferiority, (b) Second-Class Citizen and Assumptions of Criminality, (c) Microinvalidations, (d) Exoticization/Assumptions of Similarity, (e) Environmental Microaggressions, and (f) Workplace and School Microaggressions, with a Cronbach's alpha of .912 for the overall model and subscales ranging from .783 to .873. In Study 2, a confirmatory factor analysis (n = 218) supported the 6-factor model with a Cronbach's alpha of .892. Further analyses indicate that the REMS is a valid measure of racial microaggressions, as evidenced by high correlations with existing measures of racism and participants' feedback. Future research directions and implications for practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Asthma prevalence in the United States is higher than it is in many other countries and its impact in terms of healthcare expenditures and morbidity and mortality is staggering. In the United States, many groups bear a disproportionate burden of asthma. Understanding the epidemiology of adult asthma and deficits in health care can identify opportunities for improving care and effectively managing resources. Methods: The computed dependent variable, health service deficits, entails a lack of health insurance, not having a healthcare provider, deferring medical care because of cost, and having had no routine medical exam. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed on 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data to examine the relationship between health service deficits experienced by adults with asthma and socioeconomic status (SES), race and ethnicity, and geographic locale. The variable was also calculated for each US state. Results: Hispanic (OR = 1.594, 95% CI = 1.588–1.599) and Other/Multiracial (OR = 1.447, 95% CI = 1.441–1.452) adults with current asthma had greater odds of having a health service deficit. Rural adults with current asthma had greater odds of having a health service deficit (OR = 1.086, 95% CI = 1.083–1.089) when compared with non-rural adult residents. Low-SES (OR = 1.976, 95% CI = 1.971–1.982) and middle-SES (OR = 1.596, 95% CI = 1.592–1.600) adults with current asthma had greater odds of having a health service deficit. The percentage of current asthma adults experiencing at least one health service deficit by state ranged from a low of 28.5% (Delaware) to a high of 58.8% (Wyoming). Conclusion: There are clear patterns of disparity associated with health services and asthma that can help target interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Racial awareness and early attitudes was assessed in 50 majority-group Spanish children in two age groups (36-48 months and 60-71 months). A series of tasks in a semi-structured interview was administered to test the children's: Cognitive performance (classification task), sociocognitive measures (racial awareness by person description, social categorization, and self-identification) and affective measures (preferences and rejections). Children were further asked to make attributions about their mothers' racial preference and rejection, Overall, children's responses in person description and social categorization revealed that gender and colour of clothes had more salience m their perception than racial cues. In social affect tasks, children displayed a consistent in-group (White) bias, and a slight but noticeable out-group (Black) rejection. It was found that the cognitive performance measure predicted children's racial awareness and attitudes better than age did. The findings are compared to our further research, using the same procedure but in a multiracial context, and discussed in the light of theoretical approaches and the continuing sociodemographic transformations in Spain.

Abstract = {This study focused on how transracial adoptees often identify as outsiders and what factors influence this perception. Five female Korean adoptees attending college participated in in-depth interviews about their racial/cultural identities and how they were formed. Several themes related to identifying as outsiders emerged in their responses. Although participants described close relationships with their adoptive families and European American friends, they also had experienced events and assumptions that undermined these connections. Likewise, when attempting to affiliate with Asian groups, they often felt excluded because of their lack of familiarity with Korean culture and language. Several found close connections with other adoptees or with multiracial or multicultural peer groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background/Context: The last two reauthorizations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act established a policy mandate for districts to take action to reduce high rates of minority overrepresentation in special education. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The overrepresentation of Black and Latino students in special education suggests a convergence of two distinct processes: (1) assumptions of cultural deficit that result in unclear or misguided conceptualizations of disability and (2) the subsequent labeling of students in special education through a pseudoscientific placement process. This article explores how the social construct of the “normal child” became racialized through the special education referral and classification process, and subsequently produces disproportionality. Setting: This research was conducted in two multiracial suburban school districts in New York State that were identified as having an overrepresentation of students of color. Population/Participants/Subjects: Participants in the study consist of teachers and administrators within the two identified districts. Intervention/Program/Practice: Intensive technical assistance was provided to these districts to identify the root causes of disproportionality and was subsequently followed by customized professional development. Three overarching activities of technical assistance were: observing in classrooms in each of the school districts; providing root cause analyses of disproportionality; and providing culturally responsive professional development. Research Design: This research used mixed methods in collating district data, conducting technical assistance sessions with districts to identify the factors contributing to disproportionality, and creating 3-year professional development plans to address overrepresentation. In addition, researchers facilitated culturally responsive professional development to targeted groups of practitioners on topics related to improving teacher and district effectiveness in meeting the academic needs of children of color. Findings/Results: Findings were: (1) cultural deficit thinking in educators’ construction of student abilities; (2) the existence of inadequate institutional safeguards for struggling students; and (3) attempts at addressing disproportionality often result in institutional “fixes” but not necessarily changes in the beliefs of education professionals. Conclusions/Recommendations: The implementation of a culturally responsive framework can produce a shift in the special education placement process and lead to a reduction in disproportionality rates. Of note is confirmation that teacher–student interactions that begin the procedures triggering disproportionality are mired in teachers’ cultural deficit thinking. However, although teachers’ beliefs about students may change extremely slowly, effective school practices can interrupt the influence of deficit thinking.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify factors that may facilitate or impede future adoption of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention among gay and bisexual men in HIV−serodiscordant relationships. This qualitative study utilized semistructured interviews conducted with a multiracial/-ethnic sample of 25 gay and bisexual HIV−serodiscordant male couples (n = 50 individuals) recruited from community settings in Los Angeles, CA. A modified grounded theory approach was employed to identify major themes relating to future adoption of PrEP for HIV prevention. Motivators for adoption included protection against HIV infection, less concern and fear regarding HIV transmission, the opportunity to engage in unprotected sex, and endorsements of PrEP's effectiveness. Concerns and barriers to adoption included the cost of PrEP, short- and long-term side effects, adverse effects of intermittent use or discontinuing PrEP, and accessibility of PrEP. The findings suggest the need for a carefully planned implementation program along with educational and counseling interventions in the dissemination of an effective PrEP agent.

Abstract = {Though the poverty encountered by many rural youth encompasses numerous developmental challenges and substantially increases the chances for educational problems, the school context is central to promoting and constraining their development. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of school characteristics and schooling experiences to the educational achievement and aspirations of youth from high-poverty rural communities. Differences in the relationship of school characteristics and schooling experiences to the educational outcomes of students from high- versus low-poverty rural communities were also examined. Participants included 6,247 high school students from 43 low-poverty and 21 high-poverty rural communities. Approximately 51.7% of participants were female and the sample was racially/ethnically diverse (66.4% White, 9.2% African American, 8.1% Hispanic/Latino(a), 4.4% Native American, and 11.8% Multiracial). After controlling for student and family background, school characteristics (e.g., lower student–teacher ratio) were predictive of achievement for rural youth from high-poverty communities. Schooling experiences (e.g., positive perceptions of their ability, a sense of school valuing and belonging, and preparation for postsecondary education) were predictive of educational achievement and aspirations for rural youth from high- and low-poverty communities. Overall, the study highlights unique ways schools can positively shape the educational outcomes for rural youth despite community poverty.

Abstract = {Data indicate that HIV incidence is rising among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in New York City. We examined HIV testing behaviors along key demographics and in relation to substance use in a diverse sample of 18- to 29-year-old YMSM using cross-sectional survey data. The majority of YMSM had tested for HIV in their lifetime and had undertaken their most recent HIV tests as part of a scheduled health checkup or test, or a desire to know their status. In bivariate analyses, a greater proportion of Black men, Latino men, and YMSM of multiracial or other race/ethnicity had ever tested and were more likely to report a recent HIV test than White or Asian/Pacific Islander (API) men, while those living with their parents and those using stimulants were less likely to have tested. Taken together, multivariate analyses indicated that younger men, API men, and those using stimulants were less likely to have tested for HIV. Findings suggest that testing may be facilitated by reducing barriers to testing or embedding testing within routine health programs, and further, that services must be tailored to developmental and cultural nuances in order to reach all YMSM.

In this article, the authors discuss how cultural considerations can be incorporated within other evaluation approaches (e.g., school-based evaluation). The authors begin with a selective review on the rapidly growing literature on culture and evaluation, with particular attention to culturally responsive evaluation. After sketching the foundations and implementation of this approach, designated as culturally relevant democratic inquiry (CDI), the authors present an excerpt from a CDI pilot the authors have conducted. The article concludes with an analysis of the potential benefits and current challenges to implementing CDI and integrating culture into evaluations in general.

Abstract = {In this paper we draw from black and multiracial feminist theories to argue that interpersonal racial discrimination should be understood as a potentially gendered phenomenon. While there are some discriminatory practices that are directed at both black men and black women, some forms of racial discrimination affect men more than women, and some affect women more than men. Still other forms may be gender-specific. Our review of existing literature shows that most survey research has utilized measures and models of racial discrimination that fail to account for these gender differences. Drawing on the 2001-2003 National Survey of American Life (NSAL) we demonstrate the importance of gender for understanding and analysing interpersonal racial discrimination. We offer concrete ways for social researchers to centralize gender in their analyses. By doing so, we hope to advance the development of an intersectional approach to racial discrimination.

Developed from and supported by our qualitative analysis, the authors present the six dialectics of (a) Whiteness and self, (b) connection in multiracial relationships, (c) color blindness, (d) minimization of racism, (e) structural inequality, and (f) White privilege. They demonstrate that White students exhibited dialectical movement, shifting along these dialectics as they reflected on their race. Moreover, they identified their dialectical tensions as investigators that may parallel tensions experienced by those working with White students. They conclude by discussing White authenticity, or the continual struggle with the White dialectics as an educational goal, with suggestions for intervention.

Abstract = {This activity is specifically designed for graduate students studying in the counseling and mental health field (including, but not limited to, the expressive therapies, psychology, counseling, human health services, and social work). The purpose of this experiential exercise is to expand students' awareness of discrimination; increase student's ability to be compassionate and empathic toward individuals with disabilities and "differences"; increase students' ability to observe and reflect on their own biases, prejudices, and stereotypic thoughts; increase students' ability to understand how societal discrimination and prejudice may affect an individual (and create barriers and limitations); and increase students' awareness of barriers (psychological, physical, societal) to individuals' obtaining support and culturally effective psychotherapy. The activity aims to provide participants with opportunities to explore the effect of prejudice, oppression, and stereotyping on their professional development. This activity also enhances participants' compassion for differences. Guided imagery is a powerful tool, and in this exercise it is used to help students increase empathy for others by "stepping into their shoes" momentarily. I have used this experiential exercise with a variety of populations and settings, including college classrooms (both undergraduate and graduate level), corporate settings, small and large companies, counseling agencies, and municipalities. Unlike didactic or lecture-type workshops, which provide information, this workshop is experiential in nature. As cited in the Handbook of College Teaching: Theory and Application, experiential learning provides more active learning and self-exploration and increases participants' sense of ownership of learned material. With increased ownership comes greater likelihood of students' internalizing and actually using what they learn outside of class. We can never really know how another person feels or thinks. However, through this exercise, students are challenged to imagine how another person might experience life and, it is hoped, to draw inward and outward toward inquiry. As a result of this exercise, students will (a) increase their awareness of their own prejudices, (b) increase their sensitivity to the impact of societal prejudice on potential clients, (c) increase their awareness of creating a culturally sensitive counseling environment (through use of language, written material, and so forth), and (d) use guided imagery to increase their empathy for others who are different from themselves.

Abstract = {This exercise can be used successfully with graduate counselor trainees in multicultural counseling classes or career counseling classes; practicing career counselors, psychologists, and therapists in a workshop format; or undergraduate students in career life-planning or freshman-year-experience classes or other self-reflective classes. The purpose of this activity is to facilitate participants in identifying significant aspects of their cultural and life identities and in understanding the role that those identities play in their relationships and decisions. When used with counselors and counselor trainees, the exercise may be oriented toward developing an understanding of how their identities influence their interactions, assumptions, and values related to working with clients. When used with clients in career counseling, this exercise can be oriented toward developing an understanding of how their identities may influence their choices in careers, jobs, or time allocation. It can be used to help them consider rebalancing their distribution of efforts depending on their significant identities. In addition, it can be used to help them understand how these identities interact with the identities of those around them and how this interaction may influence family and work relationships. It is preferable to use the exercise in situations where participants can be in dyads because the interaction between two people optimizes the outcome. By the end of this exercise, participants will be able to identify eight significant aspects of their identity and be able to talk about each; understand how another individual's identity structure may differ from their own; describe how their identity may influence the way they interact with others' identities and how their significant identities may fluctuate as a result of their interactions with others; and recognize how their significant identities may influence their choices, such as career, job, and relationships, and discover how their time and energy allocations may need to shift to realign with their significant identities.

Abstract = {This activity is designed for counseling students in graduate training programs. It is especially useful to implement during the early stage of graduate students' training program, perhaps during their first semester. This activity is intended to serve a threefold purpose. First, it is aimed at increasing counseling students' self-awareness of how their own development has been affected by multiple factors that comprise the RESPECTFUL counseling model. Second, this activity is aimed at increasing counseling students' knowledge of the cultural multidimensionality of their clients' development. Third, it is designed to assist counselors in thinking about the strengths and potential barriers they bring to counseling situations with persons from diverse groups and backgrounds; these strengths and potential barriers are a result of their own cultural conditioning and life experiences. As a result of completing this activity, students will (a) develop a better understanding of their own cultural multidimensionality and identity; (b) become more knowledgeable of the personal, cultural, and developmental strengths they bring to counseling settings; (c) expand their thinking about their clients' cultural multidimensionality; and (d) increase their awareness of the potential limitations and biases that are linked to their own personal, cultural, and professional development as it affects the work they do.

Abstract = {This activity is designed for undergraduate and graduate students as well as professionals. Stereotypes remain prevalent in today's society, despite great efforts to eliminate them. In many ways, stereotypes can be harmful in nature as they perpetuate often incorrect notions and ignore individual differences. Even more damaging are the potential negative psychological effects on members of stereotyped groups. This activity has four purposes: (a) to provide a process that will welcome participants to experience the powerful ways in which stereotypes may impact behavior, affect, and cognition; (b) to highlight the ideology that all people possess multiple social identities; (c) to help participants understand and appreciate the visible and invisible aspects of diversity within the group; and (d) to help participants identify ways in which stereotypes and bias, both implicit and explicit, can serve as barriers to the psychotherapeutic relationship. As a result of this activity, participants will (a) increase their awareness and knowledge that both prejudice and discrimination come in a variety of forms; (b) have concrete and in-vivo examples of how people's behavior, affect, and cognition are impacted in powerful ways by stereotypes; (c) appreciate and understand that all people benefit from cultural diversity training; and (d) identify personal biases that serve as barriers to interpersonal cross-cultural encounters.

Abstract = {This activity is designed for graduate students in the fields of counseling, psychology, social work, and the helping professions in general. When working with counselors and students, it is a common belief that we must look beyond the color of one's skin. It seems comfortable to believe that a color-blind approach is easy to use when working with students. Yet when we ignore a person's racial background, we ignore who they are. Counselors who are White may ignore their own racial identity because they are part of the dominant White culture. As part of the dominant White culture in America, there are systems of privilege at work that provide advantages to the dominant White cultural and structural group. At the same time, students of color are asked to close off their racial identity and are excluded from the power differentials within systems of privilege that White cultural groups experience. Therefore, it is only when students feel a connection with their counselors or teachers—when students believe they are recognized, respected, and valued—that counselors and educators are in a position to make a positive difference in students' lives. The purpose of the activity is to introduce a discussion about how a color-blind approach is unconsciously chosen because it is easy to ignore someone's race. When we ignore a person's racial background, we ignore who they are. The activity compels one to examine how structural aspects of racism promote inequity. As a result of this activity, participants will be able to (a) deconstruct how the identification of race is easily ignored; (b) critically examine how a color-blind approach is often chosen because of one's own privileged White cultural position; (c) reflect on power, privilege, and dominance in a broader U.S. society; and (d) define how race is a social construction of U.S. society.

Abstract = {This activity is suitable for students in various disciplines, including counselor education. It is a versatile for all types of diversity-related training. Prejudice, bias, and stereotypes occur insidiously and are often outside the awareness of individuals. The purpose of this activity is to provide an opportunity for the participants to empathically understand individuals who are marginalized in society and to recognize how the participants themselves may inadvertently contribute to the status quo. This activity is aimed at expanding multicultural counseling competencies as it relates to awareness, knowledge, and skills. Participants will explore a baseline definition of diversity and will be actively involved in reformulating this definition throughout the session or sessions. Participants will explore self-identity and the influences of identity formation. Participants will become aware of their prejudices, biases, and stereotypes regarding individuals who may be different from themselves with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), sexual orientation, abilities, religious/spiritual beliefs, and so forth. Participants will enhance their awareness of how individuals who are marginalized in society by virtue of their race, ethnicity, gender, SES, sexual orientation, abilities, or religious and spiritual beliefs may self-identify. Participants will imaginatively transpose themselves temporarily into the phenomenological world of individuals who are marginalized in society because of race, ethnicity, gender, SES, sexual orientation, abilities, or religious/spiritual beliefs with the goal of giving them the opportunity to empathically understand the everyday reality of an individual who is marginalized.

Abstract = {In Singapore, palliative social workers developed their unique set of culturally sensitive and appropriate assessment and intervention tools through their clinical experiences and use them to guide their practice in a multiracial and multicultural society. Their success in the formulation of assessment includes the important consideration of family taking precedence to patients in the context of decision making and truth telling. Their assessment process is also built on establishing a social worker-patient relationship that creates a nurturing platform for eliciting emotions through expressions that are often associated with cultural-specified language usages. In Singapore society, where family forms the basic unit of care, the intervention with patients has to be done within the context of families. Key concepts in this chapter include: palliative care service delivery is based on the primary value of family as the unit of care; culturally appropriate assessment is integral and essential; culturally sensitive intervention tools enhance the clinical relationship and outcomes; decision making and truth telling are collaborative processes that begin with family.

Abstract = {Treatment advocacy (TA) programs have been implemented by AIDS service organizations (ASOs) and primary care clinics across the USA to help engage clients with HIV into care and support their adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). TA aims to empower people with HIV through education and client-centered counseling regarding HIV, ART, and other health issues; advocate on behalf of patients with providers; and make referrals to healthcare services and clinical trials. However, relatively little is known about the impact TA has on clients' healthcare experiences. The present study's objectives included exploring how TA services help clients engage in HIV care, initiate ART, and adhere to HIV medications. We conducted 25 semi-structured qualitative open-ended interviews with clients living with HIV/AIDS recruited from AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA); four HIV medical providers; and two TA staff at APLA. Of the 25 clients interviewed, 92% were male and 8% were female. The average age was 43 years (SD = 9). About 60% were African-American, 20% were White, 12% were other or multiracial, 4% were Latino, and 4% were Asian/Pacific Islander. Five interconnected themes consistently emerged across clients, TAs, and providers. TAs helped clients understand treatments and supported adherence within a holistic context. Further, TAs acted as a bridge to providers and helped clients build self-advocacy skills. Our data show that TA services go beyond traditional areas of education and treatment adherence. TA services within an ASO also provide a safe place to discuss initial HIV diagnoses and other health issues in a more comprehensive manner. TA services complemented medical and other social services by preparing clients with HIV to be better consumers of healthcare services. Future quantitative research examining the effectiveness of TA on improving clients' engagement in care and adherence is a critical next step.

Abstract = {Thorough evaluation and systematic instrumentation about self-efficacy related to physical activity (PA) in adolescents is necessary to determine efficacy and effectiveness of intervention on PA behavior. The purpose of this report was to investigate the psychometric properties of a perceived self-efficacy scale for PA. In the observational cross-sectional cohort design, an 11-item Perceived Physical Activity Self-Efficacy Scale was evaluated in a sample of 206 racially diverse adolescents at a Midwestern U.S. public middle school. Participants: The convenience sample included 105 boys and 101 girls from sixth to eighth grade: 47.1% of the participants were European American, 19.4% were African American, and 18% were "other" races and "multiracial." The University Institutional Review Board provided approval for conducting the study. The same instruments were delivered to participants on two separate occasions, 2 weeks apart. The results from this study revealed satisfactory internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .86, and test–retest reliability of .61. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed a one-factor structure with modest fit. However, the self-efficacy was not related to PA and known-group technique was not supported. The study measure demonstrated satisfactory reliability and construct validity through CFA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {While there is general agreement that, across cultures, panic disorder appears to be characterized by sudden onset of bodily sensations, such as dizziness and heart palpitations, followed by catastrophic misinterpretations of these symptoms, there remains a need for research investigating ethnic/cultural differences in the experience of panic attacks. In addition to investigating ethnic differences in the experience of panic, it is important to assess whether increased endorsement of panic symptoms translates into increased dysfunction. The present study investigated differences in the experience of panic attacks and examined the relation between symptom endorsement and overall distress and impairment in a large multiracial/ethnic student population. Preliminary analyses indicated that although overall endorsement of panic symptoms was similar across groups, differences did emerge on specific symptoms. Participants identifying as Asian tended to endorse symptoms such as dizziness, unsteadiness, choking, and feeling terrified more frequently than those identifying as Caucasian, and individuals identifying as African American reported feeling less nervous than those identifying as Caucasian. Participants of Hispanic/Latino(a) descent showed no differences from any other group on symptom endorsement. Panic symptom severity was not found to differ across racial/ethnic groups; however, the correlation between panic symptoms and panic severity was stronger for Asian and Caucasian participants than for African Americans. These results suggest that symptoms of panic may be experienced differently across racial/ethnic groups, and highlight the need for clinicians and researchers to assess panic symptoms within the context of culture.

This report summarizes National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system (NHBS) data from 2008, which indicated that, of 8,153 MSM interviewed and tested in the 21 MSAs participating in NHBS that year, HIV prevalence was 19%, with non-Hispanic blacks having the highest prevalence (28%), followed by Hispanics (18%), non-Hispanic whites (16%), and persons who were multiracial or of other race (17%). Of those who were infected, 44% were unaware of their infection. Men who know their current HIV infection status can be linked to appropriate medical care and prevention services. In2008,a total of28,468 men were approached, and 12,325 were screened for participation in NHBS at 626 venues in 21 MSAs. Among the 8,153 MSM tested, 1,562 (19%) tested positive for HIV (range by MSA: 6%-38%). HIV prevalence was 28% among blacks, 18% among Hispanics, and 16% among whites. HIV prevalence increased with increasing age and decreased with increasing education and income. Results indicated that the overall HIV prevalence was 27%, and 48% of HIV positive participants were unaware of their infection. HIV prevalence among blacks was 40%; 63% were unaware of their infection. These prevalence rates were similar to those from 2004-2005 NHBS data; the proportion of MSM unaware of their infection did not increase.

Abstract = {Background/Context: Students spend a large part of their time in schools in silence. However, teachers tend to spend most of their time attending to student talk. Anthropological and linguistic research has contributed to an understanding of silence in particular communities, offering explanations for students’ silence in school. This research raised questions about the silence of marginalized groups of students in classrooms, highlighting teachers’ role in this silencing and drawing on limited meanings of silence. More recently, research on silence has conceptualized silence as a part of a continuum. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The purpose of this project was to review existing literature and draw on two longitudinal research studies to understand the functions and uses of silence in everyday classroom practice. I explore the question, How might paying attention to the productivity of student silence and the possibilities it contains add to our understanding of student silence in educational settings? Silence holds multiple meanings for individuals within and across racial, ethnic, and cultural groups. However, in schools, silence is often assigned a limited number of meanings. This article seeks to add to educators’ and researchers’ tools for interpreting classroom silence. Research Design: The article is based on two longitudinal qualitative studies. The first was an ethnographic study of the literacy practices of high school students in a multiracial high school on the West Coast. This study was designed with the goal of learning about adolescents’ literacy practices in and out of school during their final year of high school and in their first few years as high school graduates. The second study documents discourses of race and race relations in a postdesegregated middle school. The goal of this 3-year study was to gather the missing student perspectives on their racialized experiences in school during the desegregation time period. Conclusions/Recommendations: Understanding the role of silence for the individual and the class as a whole is a complex process that may require new ways of conceptualizing listening. I conclude that an understanding of the meanings of silence through the practice of careful listening and inquiry shifts a teacher’s practice and changes a teacher’s understanding of students’ participation. I suggest that teachers redefine participation in classrooms to include silence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The rapidly changing demographic landscape of the United States, brought about by immigration, has resulted in an increasingly multiracial and multicultural population. These changes have become accentuated by the phenomenon of globalization, which occurs when there is an acceleration of movement of people, ideas, and products between nations, which also brings about an increase in the complexity of everyday problems. This article discusses the concept of identity formation and how the stresses of immigration and acculturation and the factors of resiliency and risk affect immigrant children, adolescents, and their families, so that clinicians treating these populations can be prepared to understand divergent, and often well-hidden, world views, which may cause intrafamilial conflicts and interfere with the child’s developmental process.

Abstract = {This article focuses on creating a public feminist anthropology by examining the reminiscences and reflections of the New York Women’s Anthropology Conference (NYWAC) and the International Women’s Anthropology Conference (IWAC). Both exemplify how anthropologists contributed to the theorizing of the international feminist movement and, conversely, how the differing segments of the international feminist movement contributed to anthropological theory. IWAC emphasized a cross cultural, grassroots approach that brought ethnographic knowledge to bear on political issues. For instance, its anthropologists offered a more nuanced and contextualized perspective on practices condemned by westerners, such as female genital mutilation, dowry deaths, female witchcraft and polygyny. Highlights of IWAC’s work in the international arena include the panels it organized at the NGO Forum in Nairobi, Kenya during the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the UN Decade for Women in July 1985. In summary, through IWAC academic feminist anthropologists interfaced with the concerns of the global women’s movement envisioning and enacting a cross cultural multiracial feminist solidarity.

Abstract = {This study used archival data to examine how White, Black, and biracial Black/White people respond to implicit attitude feedback suggesting that they harbor racial bias that does not align with their self-reported attitudes. The results suggested that people are generally defensive in response to feedback indicating that their implicit attitudes differ from their explicit attitudes. Among monoracial White and Black individuals, this effect was particularly strong when they learned that they were implicitly more pro-White than they indicated explicitly. By contrast, biracial Black/White individuals were defensive about large discrepancies in either direction (more pro-Black or more pro-White implicit attitudes). These results pinpoint one distinct difference between monoracial and biracial populations and pave the way for future research to further explore how monoracial majority, minority, and biracial populations compare in other types of attitudes and responses to personal feedback.

Abstract = {This study examines the literary representation of adopted Chinese girls’ psychological sense of community in Chinese-American communities. Psychological sense of community is defined as the perception that an individual is part of an inclusive social network (Hill, 1996). This sense is multi-dimensional; three specific dimensions are living in a bicultural community, participating in cultural festivals, and replicating birth-country food practices (e.g., Frost, 2008; Mannarini & Fedi, 2009). The researchers identified 37 children’s books that featured portrayals of Chinese girls adopted by U.S. families. A content analysis was conducted to determine the extent that the three dimensions were evident in the books. The analysis was based on concepts drawn from the community psychology literature. All three senses of community dimensions are described, and a fourth dimension (compensatory information/symbol) is identified. This last dimension was consistent with literature about immigrant and adoptive populations. Implications of this study for practice/research are noted.

Abstract = {Because research on ethnic-racial identity development largely excludes multiethno-racial youth, we used a mixed-methods approach to examine ethno-racial meanings and identification among 102 early adolescents (M = 11.45, SD = 0.70 years) with multiethno-racial (n = 45), mono-majority (i.e., European American; n = 29), or mono-minority (e.g., Latino, African American; n = 28) heritage. Results indicated more similarity than difference between multiethno-racial and mono-minority youth—most understood their heritage through tangible connections (e.g., language). Social (e.g., stereotypes) and individual (e.g., pride) meanings of ethno-racial heritage were also discussed. Last, we observed that most multiethno-racial youth identified with either one (53.3%) or all components of their heritage (35.6%), and these identification choices were linked to tangible experiences (e.g., travel or language proficiency). Developmental and contextual reasons for these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Whites of various European ethnic backgrounds usually have weak ethnic attachment and have options to identify their ethnic identity (Waters, 1990). What about children born to interracially married couples? Methods: I use 1990 Census data--the last census in which only one race could be chosen--to examine how African American-white, Latino-white, Asian American-white, and American Indian-white couples identify their children's race/ethnicity. Results: Children of African American-white couples are least likely to be identified as white, while children of Asian American-white couples are most likely to be identified as white. Intermarried couples in which the minority spouse is male, native born, or has no white ancestry are more likely to identify their children as minorities than are those in which the minority spouse is female, foreign born, or has part white ancestry. In addition, neighborhood minority concentration increases the likelihood that biracial children are identified as minorities. Conclusion. This study shows that choices of racial and ethnic identification of multiracial children are not as optional as for whites of various European ethnic backgrounds. They are influenced by race/ethnicity of the minority parent, intermarried couples' characteristics, and neighborhood compositions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The psychological well-being and ethnic identity of biracial adolescents are largely underrepresented topics in current scholarly literature, despite the growing population of biracial and multiracial individuals in the United States. This study examined self-esteem, ethnic identity, and the relationship between these constructs among biracial and monoracial adolescents (n = 3282). Using analysis of covariance, significant differences emerged between biracial and monoracial adolescents on both a measure of self-esteem and a measure of ethnic identity. Specifically, biracial adolescents showed significantly higher levels of self-esteem than their Asian counterparts, but significantly lower selfesteem than Black adolescents. Furthermore, biracial adolescents scored significantly higher than Whites on a measure of ethnic identity, but scored lower than their Black, Asian, and Latino peers on the same measure. Finally, correlational analyses revealed a significant and positive relationship between ethnic identity and self-esteem for all groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

The totality of these factors amount to a racial matrix of domination resulting in ethnoracism.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2004-10574-008[/rid].) As a result of a long history of both forced miscegenation and willing participation in interethnic relations, there now exists a growing group of people who closely identify with a racial or cultural group that is incongruent with their physical appearance. This can occur in one of three ways: (1) when someone is multiracial, and, therefore, not easily placed in a single racial/ethnic category, (2) when one physically resembles a racial/ethnic group other than his or her actual classification, or (3) when a person has acculturated to a racial/ethnic group other than his or her own. This paper addresses therapeutic and social concerns that are likely to emerge when counseling women fitting one of these three categories. To illustrate these factors, four case summaries of women experiencing distress directly and indirectly related to their ethnic/racial self-identification are presented, along with relevant social, interpersonal and emotional concerns.

Abstract = {The state of Hawai'i is often held up as a "multiracial"/"multiethnic" paradise. This is not only because of Hawai'i's ethnic/racial diversity and "aloha" spirit, but because of its high rates of "interracial" marriage. Using historical material as well as an open-ended qualitative "mini-survey" of college students, I dig deeper into this myth by exploring the systems of meaning prevalent in Hawai'i concerning, "race", "ethnicity", and "culture". I argue that, historically, what Hawai'i has exhibited to a much greater degree than most places in the United States is not a "lack" of racialization, but a very complex racial/ethnic code, a very nuanced system of racial and ethnic stratification. However, this system of representation contains a strong cultural component; consequently, "cultural" symbols (i.e. about "way of life" -- food, clothing, mannerisms, etc.) sometimes trump "racial" and "ethnic" symbolization.

Abstract = {In this article, based on in-depth interviews with a nonrandom sample of 35 African American parents (25 mothers and 10 fathers), the author explores the gender socialization of children in their families. Using the conceptual framework advanced by multiracial feminism, the author explores how both race and class shape the gender ideologies and behaviors of parents. The findings reveal significant support for teaching children gender role equality; however, that support is mediated by social class status (defined by education) and patterns of social mobility. In this study, 21 respondents were classified as middle-class and 14 as lower-income parents. Social class status predicts religiosity, homophobia, and structural factors that may militate against full support for gender equality or foster contradictions between ideology and behavior. The results show the role of Black parents as active agents in the lives of their children and expand our knowledge about child socialization processes in Black families. The study also contributes to multiracial feminist theory and the emerging literature on the growing social class diversity among African Americans.

Abstract = {Addressed methodological limitations in tests of contact theory which the authors extend its theoretical focus to behaviors. Linking insights from social and cognitive psychology with contact theory, the authors hypothesize that prior racial contact will have significant effects on the racial diversity of contemporary social ties. Using the 1999-2000 Lilly Survey of Attitudes and Social Networks, a national sample of 2,561 Americans (mean age 44 yrs), a univariate and multivariate analyses was conducted to test the hypotheses. Those who had experienced prior interracial contact in schools and neighborhoods were more likely, as adults, to have more racially diverse general social groups and friendship circles. They were more likely to attend multiracial as opposed to a uniracial religious congregations, and to be interracially married. In general, these findings applied not only to all Americans, but to Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics separately. They did not apply to Asians. Contact theory can and should be extended, rendering it more fruitful for studying race relations. Except when groups are an extremely small percentage of the population, even limited prior contact in multiracial settings appears to have important effects on contemporary social ties.

Using an interactionist approach, I show how the ways in which kids established and negotiated race category membership and then evaluated each other's actions accordingly, and informed how they used clique dynamics in structuring peer relations in two racially varied recreational settings. Children in the predominantly white setting and the multiracial setting appropriated, used, and negotiated race somewhat similarly, particularly regarding the invisibility and nascent emergence of whiteness as a racial category and the assumption of a shared culture and connection among kids of color. They differed, though, in how they complicated and resisted race-based clique dynamics. Because of the presence of kids of color, the greater range of relational options available to youths in the multiracial setting introduced a wider range of power dynamics into clique structures and more instability and fluidity into conceptions of race, thus disrupting easy definitions of ingroup and out-group membership and affecting the social negotiation of identity in the children's peer cultures.

There exists a lack of within-group studies on the career development process among black adolescent learners. This paper reports the findings of 2 studies aimed at addressing this gap in the literature. Study 1 focused on 91 Grade 11 Black learners from a single-race "township' school (mean age 19.3 yrs) and 81 Black Grade 11 learners from a multiracial suburban school setting (mean age 16.44 yrs). Study 2 focused on 100 Black Grade 12 learners from a single-race "township' school (mean age 19.19 yrs) and 74 Black Grade 12 learners from a multiracial suburban school (mean age 18.18 yrs). The learners were compared across key career development variables, namely, career maturity, career self-efficacy, and career aspirations. Significant differences were found in the career maturity and career self-efficacy scores of learners from different school settings with learners from the multiracial schools scoring higher than their counterparts from the single race "township' schools. Similarly, a number of differences were found in the career aspirations of learners from the different school contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget announced that a multiracial category would not be added to the 2000 census. This decision followed a protracted and heated debate. The primary reason why the authors undertook this project was to address the scarcity of empirical research that informed the 2000 census debate. The goal of this book is to provide analysis of a quantity of data that has heretofore been unavailable and to provide the quality of analysis that enables answers to important and enduring questions about racial identity. The addition of a multiracial category will most likely emerge once again as preparations are made for the 2010 census; therefore, the authors' hope for this project is twofold. First, they hope that this study will open a new path toward a more empirically based and less emotionally laden discourse on multiracialism. Second they hope that the findings reported in this book will open the debate about a multiracial category in the 2010 census to a more dynamic, multifaceted understanding of what biracial identity means to members of this population. The authors also hope that their work will be of interest ot parents of biracial children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (preface)},

Abstract = {Examines the processes by which white identities are constructed as "cultureless" among white youth in 2 high schools: 1 predominantly white, the other multiracial. The author proposes that whites assert racial superiority by claiming they have no culture because to be cultureless implies that one is either the "norm" (the standard by which others are judged) or "rational" (developmentally advanced). Drawing on ethnographic research and in-depth interviews, the author argues that in the majority-white school, processes of naturalization—the embedding of historically constituted practices in what feels "normal" and natural—produced feelings of cultural lack among white students. Contrarily, at the multiracial school, tracking and add-on multiculturalism helped constitute cultureless identities through processes of rationalization—the embedding of whiteness within a Western rational paradigm that subordinates all things cultural. The implications of these findings for critical white studies, sociology of education, and racial identity formation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Socorro was a 35-year-old Venezuelan woman who attempted suicide by overdose. The psychotherapeutic approach relied on identifying the social context, constructs, and working within Socorro's cultural framework. Cultural issues related to immigration, acculturation, and culturally based gender issues were identified. The integration of cognitive–behavioral, feminist, and multicultural approaches helped to identify how migratory stressors oppressed her sense of self. Tenets of multiracial feminism were incorporated to better understand how her social context affected her perception of relationships, how she made choices and interpreted them. Future work with Latinas should address the development of models for treatment that fuse these perspectives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of an intervention depends on its dose and on moderators of dose, which usually are not studied. The purpose of the study is to determine whether goal setting and theory-based moderators of goal setting had dose relations with increases in goal-related physical activity during a successful workplace intervention. A group-randomized 12-week intervention that included personal goal setting was implemented in fall 2005, with a multiracial/ethnic sample of employees at 16 geographically diverse worksites. Here, we examined dose-related variables in the cohort of participants (N = 664) from the 8 worksites randomized to the intervention. Participants in the intervention exceeded 9000 daily pedometer steps and 300 weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the last 6 weeks of the study, which approximated or exceeded current public health guidelines. Linear growth modeling indicated that participants who set higher goals and sustained higher levels of self-efficacy, commitment and intention about attaining their goals had greater increases in pedometer steps and MVPA. The relation between change in participants’ satisfaction with current physical activity and increases in physical activity was mediated by increases in self-set goals. The results show a dose relation of increased physical activity with changes in goal setting, satisfaction, self-efficacy, commitment and intention, consistent with goal-setting theory.

Abstract = {Objective: The Training Interventions and Genetics of Exercise Response (TIGER) study is an exercise program designed to introduce sedentary college students to regular physical activity and to identify genetic factors that influence response to exercise. Participants: A multiracial/ethnic cohort (N = 1,567; 39% male), age 18 to 35 years, participated in the study. Methods: Subjects underwent 30 weeks of exercise training, 3 days/week, for 40 minutes at 65% to 85% of age- and gender-predicted maximum heart rate reserve. Multiple measures of body size/composition, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained. Results: A total of 1,567 participants, (39% male), age 18 to 35 years, participated in the TIGER study. The prevalence of overweight/obesity in participants was 48.0%/19.3% in non-Hispanic Whites, 55.3%/24.2% in Hispanic Whites, 54.9%/25.4% in African Americans, and 38.3%/11.3% in Asians.

Abstract = {Background: Effective classroom management is the cornerstone of successful teaching. Behavioural issues affect the classroom climate as well as the time available for learning. Pupil misbehaviours can also contribute to teacher stress and burn out resulting in teachers leaving the profession. It is important for us to understand more about pupil misbehaviours from teachers’ and pupils’ perspectives in order to help teachers and schools create effective learning environments. Purpose: This study was designed to shorten an existing survey instrument that addresses pupil misbehaviour patterns. The original instrument was created for pupils, teachers and researchers to describe the spectrum of pupil disruptive behaviours in physical education class settings that impact classroom management. The resulting more parsimonious instrument can be used by teachers to gain insight into pupils’ perspectives of pupil misbehaviours and may lead to developing appropriate strategies to minimize disruptions to pupil learning. Participants and setting: Participants were 2309 secondary (junior high and high school boys and girls); along with 303 teachers (men and women) from three Midwestern states using secondary data sets. A new sample of 422 junior high and high school pupils also participated from two school districts in the Southwestern US with 55.2% male and 44.8% female participants, and reported ethnic backgrounds of European American/Caucasian (44.1%), African-American (7.8%), Latino/Hispanic (28.0%), multiracial or other (12.6.%), and 7.6% of non-identified ethnic background. Research design: This study had multiple phases including single and multiple group confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) including: (a) CFA with teacher, junior high, high school pupil secondary data sources; (b) CFA with junior high and high school pupil secondary data only; (c) the development of a shorter and friendlier instrument based on logic and factor loadings; and (d) CFAs with the new pupil sample (n ¼ 422 secondary pupils) to assess the fit of the data to the shortened 20-item model. Data collection: Pupils completed the surveys using a predefined protocol during physical education class time in both the current and previous data collection procedures. Teachers in the previous study completed surveys during their preparation time. Data analysis: CFA conducted with LISREL version 8.8 and internal consistency reliability assessments using Cronbach’s alpha. Findings: Results suggested that a more parsimonious 20-item instrument with five subscales (i.e. Aggressive, Low Engagement, Fails to Follow Directions, Harmful, Distracts) was developed for use with secondary pupils (i.e. junior high and high school) only. Internal consistency reliability was also high for secondary pupils. Conclusions: Future study with another sample of teachers is needed to develop a shortened instrument that can be used by teachers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {To engage the scholarship of William Julius Wilson is at once to engage the controversy over his work. Since the publication of The Declining Significance of Race, Wilson’s work has been at the center of major debates about race and poverty in social science and policy circles. While the most vigorous disagreements have often concerned the relative salience of race and class in explaining persistent black poverty, Wilson’s claims about culture have been central to those disagreements. What remains controversial is the causal weight afforded cultural and structural factors in explaining racial inequality. For me, the most refreshing aspect of More Than Just Race is Wilson’s careful consideration of the relative salience of structure and culture in shaping persistent poverty and his willingness to take a position in this contentious policy arena. In this regard, I prefer the vision Wilson offered in The Bridge Over the Racial Divide, in which he emphasized that achieving effective reform would require a multiracial, bipartisan coalition of grass roots community organizations, civil and women’s rights groups, labor unions, and religious organizations that seek common solutions to commonly shared problems and organize to hold political leaders accountable. In this, social scientists have a major role to play if an honest dialogue about race and poverty is to become a prominent and ongoing part of the public debate, and not only—as Wilson seems to suggest—in times that seem politically auspicious.

Abstract = {Objective: Although births of multiracial and multiethnic infants are becoming more common in the United States, little is known about birth outcomes and risks for adverse events. We evaluated risk of fetal death for mixed race couples compared with same race couples and examined the role of prematurity and low birth weight as potential mediating risk factors. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using data from the 1998–2002 California Birth Cohort to evaluate the odds of fetal death, low birth weight, and prematurity for couples with a mother and father who were categorized as either being of same or different racial groups. Risk of prematurity (birth prior to 37 weeks gestation) and low birth weight (<2500g) were also tested to see if the model could explain variations among groups. Results: The analysis included approximately 1.6 million live births and 1749 stillbirths. In the unadjusted model, compared with two white parents, black/black and black/white couples had a significantly higher risk of fetal death. When all demographic, social, biological, genetic, congenital, and procedural risk factors except gestational age and birth weight were included, the odds ratios (OR) were all still significant. Black/black couples had the highest level of risk (OR 2.11, CI 1.77-2.51), followed by black mother/white father couples (OR 2.01, CI 1.16-3.48), and white mother/black father couples (OR 1.84, CI 1.33-2.54). Virtually all of the higher risk of fetal death was explainable by higher rates of low birth weight and prematurity. Conclusions: Mixed race black and white couples face higher odds of prematurity and low birth weight, which appear to contribute to the substantially higher demonstrated risk for stillbirth. There are likely additional unmeasured factors that influence birth outcomes for mixed race couples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this work, the authors use statistics from the U.S. Census to examine trends in intermarriage, racial and ethnic combinations, and categorizations among Asian Americans. Specifically, the authors want to consider the extent to which family patterns may contribute to Asian Americans and their descendants’ continuing as distinct, becoming members of some new category or categories, or simply becoming White. Based on the data analysis and discussion, it seems most likely that Whiteness will increasingly depend on the situation: Where there are Asians,Whites, and Blacks, Asians will tend to become White. Where there are only Whites, Asians, including even those of multiracial background, may well continue to be distinguished. Yet people in mixed families will be continually crossing all racial and ethnic lines in the United States, and their numbers will steadily increase.

Abstract = {How are the lives of middle-class third-generation Mexican Americans both racialized and gendered? Third-generation Mexican Americans in California experience a racialization process continuum that extends from “flexible ethnicity,” the ability to be considered an “insider” in different racial/ ethnic communities, to racialization as nonwhite that is enforced through the deployment of negative stereotypes. Using interview data, the author finds that women are afforded more “flexible ethnicity” than men. Accordingly, men are more rigorously racialized than women. Women are racialized through exoticization, whereas men are racialized as threats to safety. Lighter-skinned individuals escaped consistent racialization. These findings have consequences for the incorporation possibilities of later-generation Mexican Americans, as women and light-skinned (often multiracial) individuals are more frequently granted “flexible ethnicity” and less strongly racialized than men and dark-skinned (often monoracial) individuals. Even among the structurally assimilated, contemporary racial and gender hierarchies limit the voluntary quality of ethnicity among third-generation Mexican Americans.

The study finds that, on average, non-Hispanic White inpatients receive care at hospitals that provide better experiences for all patients than the hospitals more often used by minority patients. Within hospitals, patient experiences are more similar by race/ethnicity, though some disparities do exist, especially for Asians. This research suggests that targeting hospitals that serve predominantly minority patients, improving the access of minority patients to better hospitals, and targeting the experiences of Asians within hospitals may be promising means of reducing disparities in patient experience.

Abstract = {Experiences of racial discrimination have been demonstrated to be related to racial and ethnic disparities in mental and physical health and healthcare. There has been little study, however, of the relationship between racism and health in children, and few psychometrically valid and reliable instruments to measure Perceptions of Racism in Children and Youth (PRaCY) exist. This paper reports on the development and testing of such an instrument, the PRaCY. Development of the instrument began with open-ended qualitative interviews, from which a proto-questionnaire was created. The questionnaire gathered information on the prevalence, attribution, emotional responses, and coping responses to 23 situations identified by participants in the qualitative phase. The proto-questionnaire was administered to 277 children between the ages of 8 and 18 years (38% Latino/a, 31% African-American, 19% multiracial/multicultural, 7% West Indian/Caribbean, and 5% Other). Item analysis resulted in two developmentally appropriate 10-item instruments (one for ages 7-13, another for ages 14-18). Internal consistency reliability was strong (alpha = 0.78 for both versions of the instrument). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated good fit for both versions (younger-Comparative Fit Index (CFI): 0.967, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA): 0.047; older-CFI: 0.934, RMSEA: 0.056). Differential item functioning analyses demonstrated no group-specific biases in item response. PRaCY scores were appropriately associated with higher depressive symptom scores and elevated anxiety scores in the younger sample. Results indicate that the PRaCY is a valid and reliable instrument that measures perceptions of racism and discrimination in children and youth aged 8-18 from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds.

Abstract = {Brazil’s extensive Atlantic coastline has profoundly influenced the nation’s history, serving as the initial locus for colonial settlement, and, subsequently, the site for almost all its major cities. Rio de Janeiro has long been the nation’s dominant international tourist destination. While Carnival remains the city’s most popular event, Reveillon, the New Years Eve celebration on Copacabana beach in honor of the sea goddess, Iemanjá, has become a major tourist draw. A familiar personage in Brazilian popular culture, Iemanjá is a major deity in African-Brazilian religions. African and African-Brazilian beliefs, historically associated with lower class and mixed race peoples, were long scorned by Brazilian elites as the superstitious practices of ignorant people. The majority of practitioners of African-Brazilian religions in contemporary Brazil are lower class and visibly of mixed race. The Reveillon evokes and com modifies Brazil’s preferred national image as a multicultural, multiracial democracy free of the Western stain of racism. As such, the celebration serves as a confirming ritual for Brazilians while, at the same time, packaging and presenting that image to tourists.

Abstract = {People routinely make judgments based on social categories (i.e., categories that place an individual within a larger social group such as sex, race, sexual orientation, religion, occupation), and are quite adept at extracting others' social category memberships. However, not all social categories are easily discernible. Some social categories are concealed, whereas other visually identifiable social categories may be obscured by conflicting cues or contexts. Whether making a judgment based on a concealed identity (e.g., sexual orientation) or a social identity with a mixture of cues (e.g., multiracial), both judgments involve construing a category based on ambiguous perceptual cues. Do the perceptual and cognitive processes underlying social categorization function for ambiguous social targets just as they do for perceptually obvious targets? In this chapter, we propose that although perceivers are surprisingly accurate at construing the identity of these ambiguous targets despite their "degraded" informational input, such construals are often constrained by additional cues, such as the context of the surrounding environment or the perceiver's motivation. In particular, perception of facial cues that mark these social categories may be particularly susceptible to top-down influences as identity cues become increasingly ambiguous. We here review evidence for motivational influences in perception, focusing on the malleability of face perception across several stages of visual perception. Additionally, we discuss the implications that such fluidity in perception has downstream, particularly with regard to face memory. Overall, we illustrate the malleable nature of social perception, where both higher-order social cognition (e.g., personal motivations, cultural associations, and contexts) and bottom-up perceptual operations collaborate in tandem to produce our routine sights and interpretations of the social world.

Diabetes patients with limited health literacy have worse health outcomes, and limited health literacy may be a barrier to effectively utilizing internet-based health access services. We investigated use of an internet-based patient portal among a well characterized population of adults with diabetes. We estimated health literacy using three validated self-report items. We explored the independent association between health literacy and use of the internet-based patient portal, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and income. Among 14,102 participants (28% non-Hispanic White, 14% Latino, 21% African- American, 9% Asian, 12% Filipino, and 17% multiracial or other ethnicity), 6099 (62%) reported some limitation in health literacy, and 5671 (40%) respondents completed registration for the patient portal registration. In adjusted analyses, those with limited health literacy had higher odds of never signing on to the patient portal (OR 1.7, 1.4 to 1.9) compared with those who did not report any health literacy limitation. Even among those with internet access, the relationship between health literacy and patient portal use persisted (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8). Diabetes patients reporting limited health literacy were less likely to both access and navigate an internet-based patient portal than those with adequate health literacy. Although the internet has potential to greatly expand the capacity and reach of health care systems, current use patterns suggest that, in the absence of participatory design efforts involving those with limited health literacy, those most at risk for poor diabetes health outcomes will fall further behind if health systems increasingly rely on internet-based services.

Abstract = {In this chapter, we seek to examine the challenges presented by cultural diversity and racial and ethnic disparities in leaders' efforts to answer the call to lead and build multiethnic, multiracial partnerships and alliances within a system of care model. As such, the key focus is on how leadership can foster inclusion among collaborative organizations with different racial and ethnic histories and experiences. To this end, the chapter 1) explores both the history of these narrowly conceptualized approaches to children as well as the influence of culture and leadership on the vision of change that was chosen, implemented, and reinforced; 2) examines dynamics and models of cultural diversity in human service organizations; 3) surfaces the challenges of bridging differences and fostering inclusion among collaborative organizations; and 4) offers practical, action-oriented recommendations for potential leaders to address these challenges.

Abstract = {This column reports on important issues regarding cultural competence in nursing education, as well as present a case example that highlights cultural incompetence and identifies the teachable moment where nursing faculty can use knowledge exchange to bring “voice” to this important issue. Creating new pedagogies and expanding traditional ones are needed within nursing education if the profession is to prepare students who can participate as competent leaders who espouse values that recognize the multicultural, multiracial, and growing diversity of both individual and family lifestyles in our society. Given the current and future diversity of the U.S. population, students and practicing nurses must be prepared to easily understand the influence of culture in individuals’ perceptions of their health needs and in their responses to the healthcare services they receive. Clinicians must also understand that the degree of patients’ compliance. We can no longer ask if nurses are ready to meet this challenge; it is an expected mandate for nurses who are practicing from an ethical perspective. More importantly, are nursing faculty who are charged with the responsibility of preparing nurses to care for an increasingly diverse population in possession of the skills, knowledge, and experiences needed to fulfill this task? Implementation of strategies and evaluation are needed to ensure that the nursing profession is meeting the goal of cultural competence.

Abstract = {This study looks at multiracial boys and girls, often referred to as “half castes,” in Nyasaland. It reconstructs the status and agency of these children by assessing the ways in which they maneuvered local African and European communities to explore opportunities that would improve their individual situations. At times they took initiative by writing letters to the Nyasaland administration for financial support. Furthermore, state responses to these letters provide evidence of how the state perceived these children, particularly the moral responsibility felt given that their fathers were often white settlers and at times colonial officials. This article also discusses the general challenges and opportunities that childhood experiences raise, with specific attention to the kind of subaltern social knowledge that such evidence presents—knowledge that challenges conventional visions of what constitutes history and who makes it.

Abstract = {Nearly 45% of youth in the United States are ethnic minority or multiracial, and minority youth currently represent a numerical majority or near majority in 25% of U.S. counties. Not surprisingly, ethnic minority youth also make up a large percentage of those who utilize mental health services in the United States, particularly in large metropolitan areas. Yet our understanding of optimal ways to treat ethnic minority youth with behavioral/emotional problems is limited. Although evidence-based treatments (EBTs) exist for youth with diverse mental health problems, many doubt whether standard EBTs can be used effectively to treat ethnic minorities. The goal of this chapter is to shed some light on this debate by summarizing what we know about EBTs for ethnic minority youth with psychosocial problems. Specifically, we examine several questions regarding psychotherapy efficacy and engagement with minority youth. First, what treatments are efficacious for ethnic minority youth and how robust are treatment effects? Second, are treatments equally efficacious for European American and ethnic minority youth? Third, what adaptations are made to EBTs that incorporate the needs of ethnic minority populations, and do these adaptations enhance treatment effects for ethnic minority youth? Finally, what evidence-based methods exist for successfully engaging ethnic minorities in mental health treatment? We draw primarily from our recent review and meta-analysis of EBTs with ethnic minority youth; however, we also summarize findings from other empirical work addressing treatment outcome issues with ethnic minority youth. The focus is on U.S. youth ages 18 years or younger with preexisting behavioral and emotional problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to evaluate the relationship between past traumatic events and the level of current traumatic stress among mothers experiencing homelessness. The data for this study were gathered from 75 homeless mothers between May 2006 and October 2006 using a cross-sectional survey design with purposive sampling. All mothers were interviewed in a face-to-face, semi-structured interview format using standardized questionnaires and measures, including the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs—Quick. Williams' Life History Calendar of Traumatic Events, the Traumatic Stress Index, and the Davidson Trauma Scale The mothers ranged in age from 18 to 50. Forty-tour percent were white, 21% were African American, 3% were Native American, 31% identified themselves as multiracial, and 9% reported Hispanic ethnicity. The analysis indicated that the average level of traumatic stress from past traumatic events and the number of distressing (but nontraumatic) events did not influence current traumatic stress; however, the number of past traumatic events significantly influenced the current level of traumatic stress among mothers experiencing homelessness. Recommendations for future research include investigating how traumatic stress affects a mother's ability to locate, find, and retain housing and how trauma interventions influence mothers to exit homelessness.

Abstract = {Objective: This purpose of this study was to describe differences in early intervention (EI) participation according to state among a cohort of young children with parent-reported developmental delays and disabilities. Methods: Data were obtained from the 2005–2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs to describe state differences in EI participation. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate the relative contributions of child sociodemographic and developmental characteristics, and state EI eligibility policy on EI participation. Results: The overall rate of EI participation was 45.7% (23.1%–83.3% across the states). EI participants were less likely to be Hispanic, live in a multiracial family, be poor, have a developmental delay, or have a less severe condition/delay. The predicted probability of receiving EI was lower for children who lived in states with more strict EI eligibility criteria than those with liberal criteria (.43 vs .52). Poverty influenced this association, with the adjusted probabilities of receiving EI for poor (<100% federal poverty level) and nonpoor (>185% federal poverty level) children being .18 and .36, respectively (P < .05). Among nonpoor children, those who lived in states with strict eligibility criteria were nearly as likely as poor children who lived in states with liberal eligibility criteria to receive EI (.33 vs .36; P < .05). Conclusions: The results of this study reveal marked disparities and unmet needs in EI participation as a function of both characteristics of the child and the state program. Improving developmental services for vulnerable populations requires addressing these sources of disparity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objectives: The reported increasing prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attendant health and family impact make monitoring of ASD prevalence a public health priority. Methods: The prevalence of parent-reported diagnosis of ASD among US children aged 3 to 17 years was estimated from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (sample size: 78037). A child was considered to have ASD if a parent/guardian reported that a doctor or other health care provider had ever said that the child had ASD and that the child currently had the condition. The point-prevalence for ASD was calculated for those children meeting both criteria. We examined sociodemographic factors associated with current ASD and with a past (but not current) ASD diagnosis. The health care experiences for children in both ASD groups were explored. Results: The weighted current ASD point-prevalence was 110 per 10,000. We estimate that 673,000 US children have ASD. Odds of having ASD were 4 times as large for boys than girls. Non-Hispanic (NH) black and multiracial children had lower odds of ASD than NH white children. Nearly 40% of those ever diagnosed with ASD did not currently have the condition; NH black children were more likely than NH white children to not have current ASD. Children in both ASD groups were less likely than children without ASD to receive care within a medical home. Conclusions: The observed point-prevalence is higher than previous US estimates. More inclusive survey questions, increased population awareness, and improved screening and identification by providers may partly explain this finding.

Abstract = {Inequality in education is placed in its historical context, first by reference to social class in the working of the Butler Act and then to its impact on students of ethnic minority origin as established by the Swann Report (1985). The flawed nature of the psychological tests as instruments, particularly IQ tests, is identified and K. Owusu-Bempah & D. Howitt's thesis (1999) (see record [rid]1999-10454-007[/rid]) that psychology continues to support, rather than undermine, racism because racism is deeply, indeed fundamentally embedded in its thinking and practice, is introduced. The curricular requirements of the 1988 Education Act are exemplified by reference to the History Syllabus with its ethno-centric emphasis and a parallel is drawn between the definition of institutional racism provided by the Macpherson report as perceived by H. Ouseley and the failure of schools to meet the needs of a multiracial society. The paper concludes that this view is supported by the findings of the Ofsted report, which found that the majority of schools continued in their failure to monitor their results by the ethnic origin of their pupils with the result that their equal opportunities policies had little effect.

The present study examined the relationships among various aspects of peer relationships to violence in 128 female juvenile offenders representing four racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and biracial/multiracial). Results revealed that high levels of peer association and extrinsic rewards from peer relationships best predicted violence among all groups. Furthermore, among Hispanics, positive peer attitudes toward delinquency significantly contributed to violence. Among Caucasians, greater time spent with peers was associated with higher levels of violence. For African Americans, tangible rewards from peer relationships significantly contributed to violence. No significant results were found among biracial/multiracial female offenders. The findings from this study highlight the significant influence of peer relationships on violence among juvenile offenders and suggest the need for further research on racial and ethnic differences.

Abstract = {Studied the pervasiveness of racial categorization among 272 children (10–12 yrs old) in multiracial schools in the Netherlands. Ss were asked to sort photographs of unknown contemporaries and to indicate preferences. Skin color, sex, and facial expression were used as 3 characteristics that varied systematically in the pictures. Results show, first, that children preferred to use different features simultaneously instead of a single feature only. Second, in a dichotomous classification task, skin color and sex were the most obvious visible features used for categorization. Gender was also used for explaining socially undesirable behavior and for indicating preferences, while race was not used in these tasks. In indicating preferences, facial expression and not skin color was used as a subordinate category. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Childcare issues lie at the critical nexus where questions relating to the economy, state ideology, culture, and women's roles come together. We explore the childcare strategies of Singapore women in the context of a society which is distinctively "multiracial" with deep cultural tap roots and which is at the same time experiencing rapid economic development. Drawing on recent conceptualisations in the work of feminist geographers and field data, we outline a framework of different modes of childcare provision available in Singapore before using this to inform the discussion on ethnic variations in women's choice of childcare strategies. In particular, we focus on the cultural concerns of women of different ethnicities, and the constraints they face. Through a series of case studies, we examine how women in a variety of ways reconcile cultural parameters with practical conditions in an attempt to come to terms with their choice of childcare strategies. More specifically, we argue that there is slippage between the state's multiracial ideology and minority women's access and experience of childcare services.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, A Faith of Our Own: Second Generation Spirituality in Korean American Churches by Sharon Kim (2010). This book is a colorful and compelling account of the entrepreneurial movement and creative energies of second generation Korean-American churches in the Los Angeles area. Well-documented and interestingly written, it demonstrates how these congregations have hybridized American and Korean spiritual practices to develop their own unique religious institutions. This book based on ethnographic work in 22 churches and interviews with 108 ministers and church leaders details: (1) why these Korean-American congregations have formed; (2) what religious traditions and spiritual resources they emphasize; (3) how they engage with the outside community; and (4) how they identify ethnically and racially. What the author found most interesting were the elements that characterize these new churches. Not surprisingly, they utilize contemporary American Christian worship styles and leadership principles to run their churches. Kim offers a well-balanced view of these congregations as she identifies the strengths and weaknesses of ethnic, pan-ethnic, and multiracial models of congregations.

Abstract = {Videotaped 3 weekly meetings of a small, multiracial clinical team made up of 10 members whose occupational titles were nonclinical research worker, community worker, trainee psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, psychiatrist, and psychotherapist. West Indian, Indian, Irish, Middle Eastern, Irish-Jewish, and English ethnic groups were represented. Findings related to group structure show that there was no common political stance on racism: Blacks were angry, Europeans were guilty, and others were confused. In an application of general systems theory, it is suggested that systems of the outside world remained the dominant theme, while systems related to the intricate function of the group were ignored. Language difficulties in the context of race were illustrated with a presentation by nonclinical members that indicated that racism was a White phenomenon. The group's entity was established by a high degree of tolerance by all members; however, younger members were intolerant of the denial of racism, especially by victims of racism. The group dynamics were influenced by the factors of race and power in an institutional setting. Problems of leadership of a small, multiracial group are noted, along with the lack of ideology and the unsuitability of the group analytic method.

Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of information regarding how racially mixed people identify and view themselves and how they relate to one another. "Racially Mixed People in America" steadily bridges this gap, and offers a comprehensive look at the social and psychological adjustment of multiracial people, models for identity development, contemporary immigration and marriage patterns, and methodological issues involved in conducting research with mixed-race people, all in the context of America's multiracial past and present. Including contributions by ethnohistorians, psychologists, and sociologists, this powerful volume will provide the reader a tool for examining ideologies surrounding race, race relations, and the role of social science in the deconstruction of race.

Abstract = {Research on racial identification in interracial families shows that children are more likely to be labeled as minority if the father is of minority race. Yet, prior studies have not sufficiently considered the role of parent-child relationships in shaping children's identification with either mother's or father's race. We address this limitation using data on 706 adolescents in interracial families from Wave 1 of Add Health. We examine whether adolescents identify with their mother's race or with their father's race, as opposed to selecting a multiracial identity, within specific combinations of parents' races. We also explore whether indicators of parental involvement (i.e., quantity and quality of involvement, educational involvement, and social control) explain any gender effects. Contrary to prior studies, we find that the tendency to match father's race is only true in black/white households, particularly if he is white, while adolescents in Asian/white families tend to match mothers regardless of her race. Moreover, while father's involvement, particularly educational involvement, was more likely than mother's to influence racial classification, adjusting for involvement does not explain gender patterns. This study shows that the well-known gender influences on parenting have little to do with the complex ways parent-child relationships impact racial classification.

Abstract = {In this study we examined associations between the quality of teacher- and parent-perceived relationships and teacher-reported parental involvement among families of children in kindergarten and whether these associations were moderated by racial/ethnic or socioeconomic factors. Participants were 483 parents and 431 teachers of children from the 2002–2003 kindergarten cohort from the National Center for Early Development and Learning Multi-State Study of Pre-Kindergarten. Parents were selected if their children were identified as African American (27%), Latino (23%), or white (50%). 52% of parents were from low-income homes. The teachers were 98% female, and had an average of 14.65 (SD = 9.96) years of experience. Teachers were 80% white, 9% Latino, 7% African American, 3% multiracial, and 1% Asian American and represented 225 schools across 6 states. Kindergarten teachers and parents completed scales during the spring of the 2002–2003 school year. Regression analyses revealed that both parent- and teacher-perceived relationship quality moderately to strongly predicted teacher-reported parental involvement regardless of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic factors. However, African American, Latino, and less educated parents were less involved in school than whites or more educated families. There were no significant interactions between racial/ethnic and socioeconomic factors. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Abstract = {The Institute of Medicine report, Unequal Treatment, asserts that conscious and unconscious bias of providers may affect treatments delivered and contribute to health disparities. The primary study objective is to measure, compare, and contrast objective and subjective cognitive processes among pharmacy, nursing, and medical students to discern potential implications for health disparities. Data were collected using a cultural competency questionnaire and two implicit association tests (IATs). Race and skin tone IATs measure unconscious bias. Cultural competency scores were significantly higher for non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics in medicine and pharmacy compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Multiracial nursing students also had significantly higher cultural competency scores than non-Hispanic Whites. The IAT results indicate that these health care preprofessionals exhibit implicit race and skin tone biases: preferences for Whites versus Blacks and light skin versus dark skin. Cultural competency curricula and disparities research will be advanced by understanding the factors contributing to cultural competence and bias.

Abstract = {Background/Context: Research has demonstrated that moving from traditional teacher-directed, monologic practices to dialogic discussions remains a daunting challenge. The reasons for this staying power are multiple: Teachers often stick with familiar canonical texts; districts often mandate the literature teachers must use; standardized tests emphasize discrete skills, strategies, and bits of knowledge rather than open-ended interpretations and responses; and many new teachers either continue to be trained with a monologic framework or have had few experiences with classroom discussions in their own education. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Although literature curricula and instructional goals get increasingly framed reductively in the form of mandated curricula and basal readers, and student achievement is measured through batteries of tests, findings from this study show how dialogic literature discussions and the forging of epistemological pathways can help us see children and teachers as intimately involved in the exploration and coconstruction of knowledge and ways of knowing fundamental to developing an informed, critical citizenry. The research question is, How do a group of fifth-grade students and their teacher cocreate and navigate an epistemological pathway during a whole-class literature discussion? Subquestions are, (1) What ideas are introduced, explored, and examined during the discussion? (2) What practices do students engage in during the discussion? (3) What practices does the teacher engage in during the discussion? Setting: The study took place in a multiracial fifth-grade classroom in an urban elementary school. Research Design: This is a qualitative case study of how the examination of a key idea— freedom—unfolds during one literature-based discussion. Data Collection and Analysis: The primary data sources for this study were a videotape and transcript of one class discussion. The ideas that were explored in the discussion and the questions asked by the students and teacher were identified. Then the specific practices of the teacher and the students as the discussion ensued were noted, which led to analytic categories associated with the content of the discussion (the nature of knowledge) and the practices (nature of knowing) that the participants engaged in. Conclusions/Recommendations: This study demonstrates how an epistemological pathway metaphor offers a way to understand the complex and fluid web of meaning that students and their teacher coconstruct and the navigation practices that the participants enacted as they engaged in a dialogic discussion that explored students’ questions and probed the meaning of the concept of freedom.

Abstract = {The United States faces a rapidly changing demographic landscape with an increasing multiracial and multicultural population. These changes largely result from three major factors: progressive aging and low birth rate of its European-origin population, lower mean ages and increasing birth rates in non-European minority groups, and a significant rise in immigration from Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Our health care system, including the mental health system, has not been effective in addressing the needs of these culturally diverse populations. This has resulted in racial/ethnic disparities in health and mental health, including lower access to treatment services and evidence based treatments, and higher morbidity and, possibly, mortality, than Euro-Americans. Work in the cultural competence of children's mental health services is ongoing and in parallel to society's efforts to enhance its multicultural competence in other fields such as education, health care, human services, and business. This approach not only benefits the diverse populations that comprise the future of America but also enhances the care of all children and families regardless of their cultural background. It also enhances our abilities to collaborate internationally on mental health problems faced by children across the world. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Exponential increases in multiracial identities, expected over the next century, create a conundrum for perceivers accustomed to classifying people as their own- or other-race. The current research examines how perceivers resolve this dilemma with regard to the own-race bias. The authors hypothesized that perceivers are not motivated to include ambiguous-race individuals in the in-group and therefore have some difficulty remembering these individuals. Both racially ambiguous and other-race faces were misremembered more often than own-race faces (Study 1), though memory for ambiguous faces was improved among perceivers motivated to include biracial individuals in the in-group (Study 2). Racial labels assigned to racially ambiguous faces determined memory for these faces, suggesting that uncertainty provides the motivational context for discounting ambiguous faces in memory (Study 3). Finally, an inclusion motivation fostered cognitive associations between racially ambiguous faces and the in-group. Moreover, the extent to which perceivers associated racially ambiguous faces with the in-group predicted memory for ambiguous faces and accounted for the impact of motivation on memory (Study 4). Thus, memory for biracial individuals seems to involve a flexible person construal process shaped by motivational factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study investigated student perceptions of the significance of having a teacher education programme located in a culturally and ethnically diverse community in New Zealand. Four successive student cohorts were interviewed each year of their teacher preparation, and also during their first year of employment. Students identified location as a major source of the programme’s strength, both for pragmatic reasons, such as providing access to tertiary study, and for reasons of community dynamics. The students noted a sense of familiarity and community that was a source of unity and strength in shaping their engagement with the institution. They indicated also that the diverse student group was a rich resource in preparing them for teaching careers in diverse urban schools. The evidence presented in the study suggests that attention to location of teacher education programmes may be an important factor in addressing imperatives for teacher educators in today’s increasingly multi-ethnic, multicultural, multiracial, multi-religious and multilingual classrooms.

In this book Sally Tomlinson takes us through a myriad of policies, government-commissioned reports and a selection of research in tracing the ever-increasing complex relationships within a developing multicultural and multiracial society, the ensuing educational demands and the strategies in response to these. Although Tomlinson identifies a number of ‘narrative themes’, from my reading there are three major themes that underpin and run through the book. These are immigration and globalization; the marketization of the education system and its impact on the system; and the salience of social class. Overall, this is a very readable book and is an invaluable resource for educators, researchers, academics and students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Different workers have reported racial disparities in the distribution of risk factors for stroke and stroke subtype (ischemic vs hemorrhagic). No transcultural transnational studies have been conducted to confirm and relate these disparities to one another. Our objective was to identify differences in the distribution of risk factors for stroke and stroke subtypes among urban-dwelling stroke patients in Nigeria, a developing country, and Germany, an industrialized country. Methods: Consecutive stroke patients in Ibadan (100) and Berlin (103) were studied. Their hospital records were screened to identify documented vascular risk factors and stroke subtype. Results: The stroke patients in Ibadan were younger than those in Berlin (t = 4.940, P = 0.000). Hypertension was significantly more common in Ibadan while cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cardiac factors were significantly more frequent in Berlin. Cerebral infarction was more common in Berlin (80%) than in Ibadan (63%). Conclusion: The risk factors associated with cerebral infarction were more frequent in Berlin. We suspect that racial disparity in risk factors for stroke may account for the difference in proportions of stroke subtype in black and white populations. Larger prospective community-based multinational multiracial studies are required to confirm these disparities and identify possible underlying genetic, dietary, and socio-economic factors.

Abstract = {The present study examines intergroup attribution bias within a multiracial context. Explicit and implicit measures, based on language analysis, were used. Participants ranged from 9 to 11 years old. Participants were shown photographs of a character carrying out an action and were then asked to write a text explaining the causes of the action. The three independent variables were: group status (majority, i.e. White vs. minority, i.e. Black), the origin of the target character (ingroup vs. outgroup), and the nature of the action (positive vs. negative). Results show no group status or interaction effects, whereas effects were found for the other two variables, origin of the target and nature of the action. Differences emerged in the participants’ treatment of the ingroup vs. outgroup target in both positive and negative actions. When confronted with a positive action, both groups showed ingroup favouritism. It appeared on an implicit as well as an explicit level for the majority group participants, but only on an implicit level for the minority group participants. Conversely, when confronted with a negative action, out-group derogation only appeared on an implicit level for majority group participants, whereas it appeared on an implicit and explicit level for minority group participants. The discussion underlines the importance of group membership and moderates the effects of group status in intergroup bias studies from the perspective of the evolution of social norms and intergroup relationships.

Abstract = {Social axioms are generalized beliefs about other people, the social environment, or the spiritual and physical world, and are central to a person's belief system. Their function is to enhance the survival and functioning of the person in his/her social and physical environment. This study examined social axioms among Malay, Chinese, and Kadazan psychology students enrolled in the School of Psychology and Social Work at the Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS). Sabah is a multicultural and multiracial society and the students studying in UMS hold different cultural beliefs and values. The sample comprised of 273 students (77 Malays, 81 Chinese, 77 Kadazan, and 38 others). Each student participated in the research by completing a researcher-designed demographic data sheet, the 82-item Social Axioms Survey (SAS) tapping the five-factor structure of Social Cynicism, Social Complexity, Reward for Application, Fate Control, and Religiosity. Analysis of variance was performed to investigate the differences between gender and between ethnic groups in social axioms. The results of this study indicated significant differences between the genders in Social Cynicism and Fate Control. There were also significant differences between Malay, Chinese, and Kadazan students on the factors of Fate Control, Religiosity, and Social Cynicism. Correlations between the Dimensions of the SAS and between the demographic variables and social axioms were examined. The implications of these findings are discussed.

For this study, 344 undergraduate college students (233 females, 111 males; 76% White/Caucasian, 10% Asian American/Asian, 7% African American/African, 5% multiracial/multicultural or other, 2% non-White/Hispanic; 79% freshmen, 13% sophomores, 4% juniors, 3% seniors, 1% unspecified grade/year level) completed the Purpose in Life Test, Part A (Crumbaugh & Maholick, 1964); the College Self-Efficacy Inventory (Solberg, O’Brien, Villarreal, Kennel, & Davis, 1993); the Scale of Perceived Social Self-Efficacy (Smith & Betz, 2000); the General Self-Efficacy Subscale of the Self-Efficacy Scale (Sherer et al., 1982); and finally, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (Crowne & Marlow, 1960). All of the variables of self-efficacy were significantly (p < .01) and positively correlated with purpose in life. Regression analysis revealed that general self-efficacy was the most significant predictor of Purpose in Life scores. The current study lends support to the idea of creating interventions based on self-efficacy theory in order to positively influence students’ subjective sense of purpose in life for the purpose of improving college student retention.

Abstract = {Psychological distress is an important indicator of the mental well-being of the population. Findings regarding racial differences in distress are inconclusive but may represent an important pathway through which disparities exist across a number of physical health outcomes. We used data from the 1994 Minority Health Survey, a nationally representative multiracial/ethnic sample of adults in US households, to examine racial/ethnic differences in psychological distress (n = 3623). Our primary study aim was to examine differences between additive and multiplicative models in assessing the influence of income and gender on the race/distress relationship. We hypothesized that additive models do not sufficiently account for potential interactions of race with income and gender, and may therefore mask important differences in distress between racial groups. The results suggest that our hypotheses were supported. After adjusting for income, there were no statistically significant differences in distress levels between racial groups. However, significant differences emerge when multiplicative models are used demonstrating the complexities of the intersection of race, income and gender in predicting psychological distress. Black men and women of higher income status represent a particularly vulnerable group, whereas Hispanic men are especially hardy. We discuss the implications of our findings for future work on racial health disparities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

In the analysis, blues music is viewed as an articulation of the reciprocal relationship between the political, economic, historical, and social struggles of African American masses and a unique cultural expression. The analysis also foregrounds the constructs of crossroads theory (Meacham, 2000, 2001a, 2001b) and code meshing (Canagarajah, 2006) as heuristics for understanding how literacy and language function in multiracial contexts for people who confront discrimination and subjugation. Several discourse strategies are highlighted in the analysis of the text: the use of the Great Migration and fugitive slave narratives, the use of linguistic markings to represent 20th-century white supremacy and the maintenance of southern and northern Jim Crow policies, the use of the South as a literary symbol of black home/motherland, the use of the blues and spirituals as a lyrical blueprint for narrative writing, and the use of the psychic and historical politics of the trickster as central to textual organization and characterization. The analysis of TheBlues of Flats Brown is used to argue for an approach to reading in classrooms that centers students' cultural rhetorics.

Abstract = {Objectives: One of the hopes of having diverse campus environments is that the daily interaction with students from different backgrounds will promote interracial understanding and friendship. However, it is not clear to what extent interactions and friendships are multiracial. This article examines the impact of college characteristics, social distance felt toward other groups, and precollege friendship diversity on the formation of interracial friendships in the first year of college. Methods: Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, I examine how college characteristics, social distance felt toward other groups, and precollege friendship diversity affects the formation of interracial friendships in the first year of college. Results: The results show that while precollege experiences and initial attitudes do have an impact on the formation of interracial friendship in college, campus racial/ethnic diversity is also important in predicting friendship heterogeneity. Minorities have higher predicted friendship diversity than whites, but this difference nearly disappears in the most diverse schools due to the interactive effects of school diversity on friendship diversity for white students. Conclusions: This research provides evidence of the social benefits of assembling a diverse student body, particularly for white students, and can add to the debate over the continuation of affirmative action policies.

Abstract = {The goal of the study was to examine whether social motives (social mimicry, mutual attraction, and unreciprocated attraction) predict changes in antisocial behavior across middle school grades. The 2,003 initial participants (55% girls) were drawn from a larger longitudinal study of urban public school students: 44% Latino, 26% African-American, 10% Asian, 9% Caucasian, and 11% multiracial. Analyses of peer nominations and teacher-rated behavior included five waves of data between the fall of sixth grade and the spring of eighth grade (n = 1,260-1,347 for longitudinal analyses). Supporting the social mimicry hypothesis, students who associated peer-directed aggression with high social status in the beginning of middle school engaged in elevated levels of antisocial conduct during the second year in the new school. Additionally, unreciprocated attraction toward peers who bully others in the beginning of middle school was related to increased antisocial behavior in the last year of middle school. No support was obtained for the mutual attraction hypothesis. The findings provide insights about possible social motives underlying susceptibility to negative peer influence.

Abstract = {Objectives: Adults in South Africa demonstrate rates of mental illness at or above levels elsewhere in the developing world. Yet there is a research gap regarding the social context surrounding mental health in this region. The objective of this analysis was to characterize the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms and perceived stress among a heterogeneous South African population. Methods: Low-income adults (n = 257) in Capetown, Port Elizabeth and Durban were interviewed regarding demographics, income, subjective social status, life events and decision-making. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used. Results: CES-D scores were 18.8 (SD 11.7), with 50.4% of men and 64.5% of women exceeding the cut-off at which professional care is recommended (p = 0.03). PSS scores were 18.6 (SD 6.7), with a mean of 17.5 among men and 19.6 among women (p = 0.02). In multivariate regressions, increased CES-D scores were associated with more household members (p < 0.1), lower educational attainment (p = 0.07), less income stability (p < 0.07), lower subjective social status (p < 0.01) and independent decision-making (p = 0.04). Increased PSS scores were associated with female gender (p < 0.05), multiracial race (p < 0.02), more household members (p < 0.1), lower subjective social status (p < 0.02) and recent birth or catastrophe (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and perceived stress are public health concerns in this sample, with more symptoms among those with fewer resources.

This study documents the affects of various policies that were implemented to create equity and equality in urban, multiracial and socio-economically diverse classrooms.

Using the lens of Critical Race Theory to examine issues of interest-convergence and the effects of court-ordered desegregation initiatives, the researcher documents how teachers have come to terms with two major curricular changes that work in conjunction with other curricular reforms. Research that considers the affects of large-scale policy initiatives on classroom practices is necessary to further current conversations on successful reform implementation.

Abstract = {Racial integration in religious congregations is a topic of keen interest to researchers and religious leaders. Although not common, there are congregations that successfully reach across cultural lines to attract adherents. Prior studies tend to dichotomize congregations into categories of multiracial and nonmultiracial and, thereby, miss a wider range of racial variation. Using nationally representative congregational data, this article paints a more representative picture of racial diversity in U.S. congregations and puts forward a theory of congregational identity to account for why some congregations succeed at accommodating multiple racial groups in a society where religious life remains overwhelmingly segregated. The analysis capitalizes on a numeric scale of diversity, which measures the evenness of racial group representation in a congregation. While the external environment creates opportunity for racial diversification in congregations, findings demonstrate racially diverse leadership, charismatic worship, and small groups as internal congregational features also relevant to diversity.

Abstract = {The editorial pieces and two articles on mixed congregations in this issue raise vital issues and help advance our knowledge. It is clear in reviewing the literature that we do not have agreement on what term to use for these types of congregations. Multiracial, multiethnic, multicultural, and interracial are the most common. As will be made clear in reading the Edwards (see record [rid]2008-03255-003[/rid]), Marti (see record [rid]2008-03255-004[/rid]), and Garces-Foley (see record [rid]2008-03255-005[/rid]) works, we do not have agreement on the term because the terms are intimately linked to theoretical perspectives, conceptualizations, and for much applied work, theological positions. Some say the driving factor of the United States always has been and remains race. Others say that ethnicity has superceded what they often view as an outdated concept ("there is only one race, the human race" they often say). Still others say neither race nor ethnicity is at the root of what should be and is being studied. Rather, culture is at the core. In short, the terms are not interchangeable. Each has important meanings and implications for research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Rationale: Although depression is common in older adults with schizophrenia, it has not been well studied. The authors examine those factors that are related to depression in a multiracial urban sample of older persons with schizophrenia, Methods: The schizophrenia group consisted of 198 persons aged 55 or older who lived in the community and developed schizophrenia before age 45- Persons with substantial cognitive impairment were excluded from the study. A community comparison group (N = 113) was recruited using randomly selected census tract data. The authors adapted George's Social Antecedent Model of Depression, which consists of six categories comprising 16 independent variables, and used a dichotomous dependent variable based on a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale cutoff score of ≥16. Results: The schizophrenia group had significantly more persons with clinical depression than the community comparison group (32% versus 11%, respectively; χ² = 28.23, df = 1, p = 0.001), Bivariate analysis revealed that eight of the 16 variables were significantly related to clinical depression in the schizophrenia group. In logistic regression, six variables retained significance: physical illness (odds ratio [OR] = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.18), quality of life (OR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.76-0.93), presence of positive symptoms (OR = 1.12, 95% CI, 1.02-1.21), proportion of confidants (OR = 0.03, 95% CI, 0.01-0.39), copes by using medications (OR = 2.12, 95% CI, 1.08-4.13), and copes with conflicts by keeping calm (OR = 1.34,95% CI, 1.03-1-74). Conclusion: Consistent with earlier studies of schizophrenia in older persons, the authors found physical health, positive symptoms, and several nonclinical variables to be associated with depression. Potential points for intervention include strengthening social supports, improving physical well-being, more aggressive treatment of positive symptoms, and increasing the recognition and treatment of depression.

Abstract = {Background: Experts recommend that health care providers (HCPs) collect patients' race/ethnicity and language, but we know little about public attitudes towards this. Objectives: To determine attitudes towards HCPs collecting race/ethnicity and language data. Participants: A telephone survey was held with 563 Californians, including 105 whites, 97 blacks, 199 Hispanics (162 Spanish-speaking), 129 Asians (73 Chinese-speaking), and 33 multiracial individuals. Measures: Attitudes towards HCPs asking patients their race/ethnicity and preferred language, concerns about providing their own information, reactions to statements explaining the rationale for data collection, and attitudes towards possible policies. Results: Most (87.8%) somewhat or strongly agreed that HCPs should collect race/ethnicity information and use this to monitor disparities, and 73.6% supported state legislation requiring this. Support for collection of patients' preferred language was even higher. However, 17.2% were uncomfortable (score 1-4 on 10-point scale) reporting their own race/ethnicity, and 46.3% of participants were somewhat or very worried that providing information could be used to discriminate against them. In addition, 35.9% of Hispanics were uncomfortable reporting their English proficiency. All statements explaining the rationale for data collection modestly increased participants' comfort level; the statement that this would be used for staff training increased comfort the most. Conclusions: Although most surveyed believe that HCPs should collect information about race/ethnicity and language, many feel uncomfortable giving this information and worry it could be misused. Statements explaining the rationale for collecting data may assuage concerns, but community engagement and legislation to prevent misuse may be needed to gain more widespread trust and comfort.

But we may do adolescents a disservice when we curtail their participation in these spaces, because the educational and psychosocial benefits of this type of communication can far outweigh the potential dangers. These benefits include developing cognitive skills that are consistent with those required in educational settings and perspective-taking skills that are necessary for citizenship in an increasingly multiracial society. Alternative strategies for keeping adolescents safe online should build on the increasing technological awareness and sophistication of teens themselves.

Abstract = {We hypothesize that individuals who self-identify with one racial group but are routinely perceived by observers as "looking like" another racial group may experience negative outcomes associated with this stressful situation. Since American Indians experience very high rates of misclassification, we use them as our case in point. Drawing from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, our analyses compare young American Indian adults who are perceived as another race by an observer to those who are correctly classified, using several indicators of psychological distress: depression, suicidal thoughts, use of psychological counseling services, suicide attempts, and fatalism. We also investigate differences in racial attitudes and behaviors, such as belonging to an ethnic solidarity organization or believing it is important to have a committed relationship with someone of the same race. The evidence suggests that, on the whole, misclassified American Indians have higher rates of psychological distress. We conclude by discussing our findings and their wider implications, especially in the context of an increasingly heterogeneous and multiracial society.

Abstract = {Americans do not know what percentage of the nation's residents are whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians. Using the 2000 General Social Survey, I find that respondents of all races underestimate the percentages of whites and overestimate the percentages of racial/ethnic minority groups and multiracial Americans in the United States; however, they perceive their local communities quite differently. As a first step toward understanding this discrepancy, I test whether individuals' local surroundings serve as a source of information for their pictures of the United States. I examine the relationship between "objective" data and respondents' subjective perceptions of where they live, and compare their respective effects on Americans' perceptions of the nation. Multivariate multilevel analyses show that respondents' perceptions of different racial group sizes in their communities are the strongest predictors of innumeracy at the national level, while "objective" racial context measured at the local level has less of an effect. These findings have important implications for research on racial context, which assumes that census numbers for respondents' locales are good proxies for their perceptions of the size of racial/ethnic groups in their communities. Furthermore, these findings suggest that scholars need to start thinking about why whites and non-whites have similar "big pictures" of the nation, why their "little pictures" vary a great deal, and why the motivations for over- and underestimation may differ by racial/ethnic group.

Sample ethnic subgroups included European American, Latino/Hispanic, African American, Asian American, Native American, Pacific Islander, and Biracial/Multiracial. Excellent reliability statistics were obtained for the full sample (alpha = .93, N = 2,722) and various ethnic subgroups (alpha = .93 to .95, n = 44 to 1,383). Correlations between self-efficacy scores and measures of condom use were similar in magnitude to effect sizes reported in research involving civilian populations (r = .18 to .34). Significant differences in self-efficacy scores for groups of condom users (e.g., consistent and nonconsistent users) for the full sample of men and ethnic subgroups provided further support for construct validity (p < .05). Study findings support the reliability and validity of the condom self-efficacy measure in this population and indicate its usefulness and the need for investigating its psychometric properties in other populations.

Abstract = {Guilt is widely recognized as an important self-regulatory emotion, yet alternative theoretical accounts view guilt primarily as either a punishment cue or a prosocial motivator. Integrating these views, we propose that guilt functions dynamically to first provide a negative reinforcement cue associated with reduced approach motivation, which transforms into approach-motivated behavior when an opportunity for reparation presents itself. We tested this hypothesis in the context of racial prejudice. White subjects viewed a multiracial series of faces while cortical activity was recorded using electroencephalography. Following bogus feedback indicating anti-Black responses, subjects reported elevated guilt, which was associated with changes in frontal cortical asymmetry indicating reduced approach motivation. When subjects were presented with an opportunity to engage in prejudice-reducing behavior, guilt predicted greater interest in prejudice reduction, which in turn was associated with an approach-related shift in frontal asymmetry. The results support a dynamic model in which guilt is associated with adaptive changes in motivation and behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Students (N = 35) from 2 3rd-grade classrooms chose books with covers that depicted main characters who were either Black or White. The authors sought to determine whether books in which the race of the principal characters was identical with that of the students motivated their reading. Quantitative and statistical results did not support such a conclusion. Instead, data suggest that students often choose books with characters who have racial backgrounds different than theirs. Thus, teachers can begin to bridge differences among races by providing multiracial books in their classroom libraries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study examined the male identity 'positions' of South African adolescent boys in relation to the unconscious, dialogical, and discursive construction of masculinities. Multi-method approaches were used within a qualitative methodology to generate triangulated data consisting of 371 photographs, individual interviews, and focus group discussions. The participants were 29 boys aged 15 to 17, drawn from a rural and an urban school in KwaZulu-Natal. Our findings suggested that the male peer group was a crucial context for the construction of masculine 'acceptability' that involved performative acts of displayed toughness, risk-taking, and emphasised heterosexuality. Norms of 'acceptability' were organised around the visible objectification of girls through 'non-relational heterosexuality'. Race identities played a significant role in the construction and subjectivity of masculinity, and there were changing constructions of masculine identities in relation to race identities, particularly in the context of a 'multiracial' urban school. Adolescent boys sometimes experienced significant distress in response to processes of alienation and homophobic harassment that were enacted in peer-group cultures. Crucial in our discussion of racialised identities and homophobia was the notion of abjection, the social and unconscious process whereby iterated and disavowed otherness becomes the means by which the boundaries of acceptability are policed. Participants in this study situated, negotiated, and defended multiple subject positions at varying distances from an illusory 'acceptable' masculinity through social and unconscious processes such as abjection, projection, and denial.

The richness of Breines's data allows her to chronicle the day-to-day struggles and the emotional labor of white and Black feminists.

Abstract = {Transracial adoption, defined as the adoption of a child from a race that is different from that of the adoptive parent, has attracted interest among social scientists seeking to understand how the public views adoption. Studies conducted mostly in industrialized countries suggest that most people approve of such adoption, believing it is a better alternative to out-of-home care. Those who are opposed believe that it risks damaging the racial or ethnic identity of the child. In South Africa, it is just over 10 years since the new democratic government repealed all previous laws that prohibited mixing of races including interracial marriage and transracial adoption. In the present study we sought to understand South African students' beliefs and attitudes about transracial adoption. A sample of 72 mostly black undergraduate students was surveyed. The results showed that most of the students approved of transracial adoption and believed that it promoted racial tolerance. Less than 5% believed that transracial adoption could lead to the loss of a child's culture. The results were interpreted as suggesting that young South Africans may be committed to the vision of a multiracial nation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

However, when the service component involves having White college students tutor Black and Latino schoolchildren, there are numerous ethical issues that must be seriously considered. It is argued that a number of ideological and institutional barriers prevent multicultural service-learning from being an ethically defensible and transformative pedagogy.

Abstract = {Data on the prevalence of Hypertension (HTN) among elderly Asians is limited. We investigated the prevalence of elevated blood pressure (EBP) and its risk factors in a multiracial Southeast Asian elderly population who participated in the National Kidney Foundation Singapore nationwide screening programme. Among 19,848 subjects ≥65 years (approximately 6% of the total Singapore population), the mean age was 70.6 ± 5.26 yrs. After excluding 36.6% with known HTN, analysis revealed that 5,889 (46.8%) of the remaining population had previously undetected EBP >140/90. Increasing age, male gender, BMI ≥23 kg/m² and pre-existing diabetes were significantly associated with previously undetected EBP on multivariate analysis. 6% of cases with undetected EBP had proteinuria suggestive of longstanding EBP and renal damage. We conclude that there is a high prevalence of undetected EBP in elderly Asians, suggesting the need for increased efforts in screening in the elderly population.

Abstract = {Magnet schools are well established and by now quite familiar public yet alternative schools in urban areas. They are high achieving, multicultural, multiracial public yet alternative schools of choice with a specialized curriculum focus (e.g., the creative and performing arts, engineering, languages, and computer science) and/or particularly innovative pedagogical approaches and have the principal dual focus of improving educational quality and increasing racial integration. But how have magnet schools come about and how have they come to be an integral part of urban education? In this chapter, we discuss magnet programs as a relatively recent educational reform initiative that have been developed and implemented primarily to address a thorny and recurrent problem in urban education, namely racial and economic (re)segregation of schools and consequent educational inequity. We concentrate on contextualizing magnet programs in terms of a rich history of American educational reform, traditions of alternative schools and efforts at desegregating schools and creating educational equity for students irrespective of race, ethnicity, location, and socioeconomic status. Thus, while our discussion is in a sense about educational improvement, we are dealing not merely with a standards based, supposedly "apolitical" conception of educational improvement but with a decidedly progressive conception, one inextricably linked with the historical struggle for diversity, equity and social justice in and through education. While acknowledging that urban schools, like much of the educational system in general can benefit from educational reform and improvement, we want to move in this essay beyond popular culture (mis)conceptions to explore the pros and cons of magnet programs as a specific contemporary educational reform initiative (and indeed movement) for improving urban schools. In contrast with presentist, individual agency focused popular and professional depictions, we concentrate on providing a historical context of the magnet school model and consider magnet programs as a broad educational initiative that involves contributions from everyone from policymakers, school administrators, and teachers to students, parents, and local communities. In this chapter, we put forward an explanation of the historical, social, and educational circumstances in which magnet schools were developed and in which they currently operate in an attempt to provide a context for understanding magnet schools that reaches beyond the often superficial, presentist, sensationalist, negative, and stereotypical images of urban schools found in popular culture and even at times in educational discourse.

Abstract = {(This chapter was originally published under the same title in the International and Intercultural Communication Annual, vol. 19, 2006, pp. 166-92.) This chapter emerges out of our struggles to teach whiteness without recentering white(ness-identified) students. To do so, we untangle the distinctions between whiteness as a universalizing, privileging process and white identity and/or the white body. This distinction is important for two reasons: to provide a space to theorize and teach whiteness as a multiracial phenomenon, as opposed to an identity that holds meaning only for white people; and to empower students and educators to act against white supremacy. We argue that whiteness is a process that we all negotiate, whether we are white, brown, black, or some combination of the above. While we are not arguing to completely decouple whiteness from white bodies (as white bodies often move through the world being read as white by others even if the white person is attempting to disrupt their own white privilege), we are seeking to (un)hinge white identities/bodies from whiteness, for the two have become synonymous. We use the symbol of a hinge to signify a connection, an axis that allows a door to swing in different directions even as it keeps it connected to the central force of whiteness. This metaphor evokes the constant negotiation between hinging whiteness to white identities/bodies to hold white people firmly accountable within that articulation; and then unhinging that very conflation to empower white people and people of color, to move within and against its nuanced forces of racial domination. The essentialized articulation between whiteness and white identity must be unhinged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

In our research, we consider how young adults with parents of different racial backgrounds come to rewrite their racial identity, becoming biracial, multiracial, or mixed race. We study the personal narratives of biracial youth to understand how they talk about arriving at these new self-identifications. The personal narrative is an attempt to make sense of the self through time (Cohler, 1998) by organizing experience into an understandable story of the past, present, and future (Ricoeur, 1984).

Abstract = {Until recently, most studies of the colonial period of the American West have focused on the activities and agency of men. Now, historian María Raquél Casas examines the role of Spanish-Mexican women in the development of California. She finds that, far from being pawns in a male-dominated society or the giddy señoritas depicted in myths about California's romantic past, Californianas of all classes were often determined creators of their own destinies, finding ways to choose their mates, leave unsatisfactory marriages, and maintain themselves economically. Using a wide range of primary and secondary sources in English and Spanish, Casas unveils a picture of women's lives in these critical decades of California's history. She shows how many Spanish-Mexican women were able to negotiate the precarious boundaries of gender and race to choose Euro-American husbands, and what this intermarriage meant for the individuals involved and for the larger multiracial society evolving from California's rich Indian and Hispanic past. Casas's discussion ranges from the ranches and warehouses that shaped California's burgeoning economy to the intimacies of private households and ethnically mixed families. Here we discover the actions of real women of all classes as they shaped their own identities. Married to a daughter of the land contributes to the history of women in the American West and to our understanding of the complex role that gender, race, and class played in the Spanish Borderlands.

Abstract = {Multiracial children, transracial adoptees, and foster children in families wherein more than one racial or cultural heritage exists have a unique experience inside and outside the home that is distinctly different from children being raised in racially and culturally homogeneous families. The Cultural-Racial Identity Model serves as a framework for understanding and working with members of racially integrated families by attending to racial and cultural differences among parents and children and by considering the impact that the experiences and the attitudes of parents, peers, extended family, social support networks, and the larger community have on child development. The Cultural-Racial Identity Development Model was the first comprehensive guide for practitioners' use with racially and culturally integrated families. This chapter focuses on explaining the Cultural-Racial Identity Model when used with transracial and international adoption. In this chapter, the authors review the need for a systematic means for understanding the identity experiences of transracial adoptees, describe the terminology used to understand transracial adoption, explain the framework used in the model, and discuss clinical applications of this model.

Abstract = {Two studies examined early perceptual processing and explicit racial categorization of racially ambiguous faces. Participants viewed racially ambiguous faces as well as faces of Whites, Asians, and Blacks while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Initial perceptual processes, indexed by ERP components occurring within 200 ms of stimulus onset, showed that racially ambiguous faces were differentiated from Asian and Black but not White faces. Later in processing, around 500 ms after stimulus onset, racially ambiguous faces were differentiated from White faces. However, the racially ambiguous faces were still perceived more similarly to Whites than to Asians or Blacks. Finally, explicit social categorization reflected the ambiguity of the faces. These results highlight the complex nature of racial perception, and the importance of understanding how the growing population of multiracial individuals is perceived.

Abstract = {When the Human Genome Project was completed, scientists discovered whole new populations that were at risk of heritable disorders. This revelation entails an obligation to be scientifically accurate and socially responsible in the biological classification, or labelling, of these populations. Neulander will define as unscientific 'folk taxonomy' all biological classification according to cultural commonalities: those traits and characteristics that--like religious affiliation--can only be acquired through learning, and are not biologically heritable. Noting the widespread popularity of sweeping cultural characteristics into biological classification--as in use of the term 'Jewish' for certain heritable diseases--she examines the social consequences of giving religious labels to genetic disorders in multiracial New Mexico, where disease-based claims of 'secret' or crypto-Jewish forebears are being used to assert an overvalued line of white ancestral descent, and where use of the term 'Jewish' to determine who is at risk of heritable diseases is generating, in turn, the use of heritable diseases to determine who is a Jew. The phenomenon will be examined in both folkloric and academic contexts, since locals who seek crypto-Jewish legitimacy thereby striate, into colour-coded levels of human valuation, what is otherwise a cohesive society, bringing their academic enablers into active, legitimating complicity. Neulander's essay seeks to help readers distinguish between folkloric and academic motivations and methods for discerning and describing human differences. Finally, she proposes a more valid and reliable means of classifying populations at risk of heritable disorders, the better to ensure results that are both scientifically accurate and socially responsible.

Prominent examples include dissociation, trauma-related cognitions, and depression, but no empirically based model regarding these variables has been presented. We examined 90 adolescents housed in a state-run facility for youths who experienced maltreatment, violence, and/or other traumas. Utilizing psychometrically strong dependent measures, we identified a structural equation model with depression as a key mediating variable between (1) dissociation and trauma-related cognitions and (2) PTSD symptomatology. In addition, African American status was found to weaken this relationship, whereas multiracial status was found to strengthen this relationship.

To a great extent, the author welcomes this reaffirmation of the importance of culture and cultural identity as central and meaningful concepts and terrains that have to be traversed within and between culturally different persons. What is evident from this is that therapists and academics writing within the person centered approach are vigorously debating these seminal issues in order to enhance the sensitivity of theory and practice to application in today's multiracial, multicultural world.

Abstract = {The purpose of this essay is to propose new areas of research that are going to be increasingly relevant to the subfield of ethnic and racial leisure. More specifically, we propose that two societal trends need to be taken into account when assessing the long term prospects of research on leisure behavior of ethnic and racial minority groups: (1) the emergence of a new racial and social structure and (2) the increasing complexity in measuring and articulating ethnic identity. Leisure scholars have recognized the limits of "single variable" analyses in this complex society and have begun to examine the intersection of race, ethnicity, gender, age, and social class in relation to leisure behavior and related outcomes. Another factor that needs to be taken into account in future research on leisure behavior of ethnic and racial minority groups is the complexity of measuring and negotiating multiracial/ multi-ethnic identity. In recent years the research on race and ethnicity has expanded to include more diverse population groups and has applied a broader set of methodologies. Understanding the leisure behavior of ethnic and racial minorities is an important area of inquiry that has evolved over time. Understanding leisure as it relates to the richness that racial and ethnic diversity brings to community life as well as the marginalization and exploitation of particular subgroups of our population is an exciting and worthwhile endeavor that deserves further investigation.

Results: The proportions of patients who described themselves with 1, 2, 3, or 4 terms were 46%, 33%, 14%, and 6%, respectively; 2 said only "American" (1%,) and 1 refused to answer (0.5%). The average completion time was 37 ± 17 seconds. Rates of missing values and categorization as "other" race were lower than with the closed questions. Agreement between racial/ethnic categorization with openended and closed responses was 93% (κ=0.88). Latino/Hispanic and multiracial/multiethnic individuals were more likely to prefer using their own categories to describe their race/ethnicity. Conclusions: Collecting race/ethnicity data using patients' own racial/ethnic categories is feasible with the use of computerized systems to capture verbatim responses and results in lower rates of missing and unusable data than do standard questions.

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined cancer screening and risk factor patterns in California using 4 different statistical tabulations of American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) populations. Methods: We used the 2001 California Health Interview Survey to compare cancer screening and risk factor data across 4 different tabulation approaches. We calculated weighted prevalence estimates by gender and race/ethnicity for cancer screening and risk factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and access to care variables. We compared AIAN men and women with members of other racial groups and examined outcomes among AIAN men and women using the 4 tabulation methods. Results: Although some differences were small, in general, screening and risk factor rates among American Indians/Alaska Natives were most similar to rates among Whites when the most inclusive multiracial tabulation approach was used and least similar when the more exclusive US census "single-race" approach was used. Conclusions: Racial misclassification and undercounting are among the most difficult obstacles to obtaining accurate and informative data on the AIAN population. Our analysis suggests some guidelines for overcoming these obstacles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this article the author draws on 3 incidents to investigate how teachers and students purposefully negotiate to manage incipient conflict when race is a confounding factor. The author does so to propose a methodology and theoretical framework for researching multiracial classroom teaching and learning that could inform White literacy teachers' pedagogy with students of color. The approach construes race as a dynamic part of classroom social life in which expressions of race are affected by and affect teachers' and students' classroom norms of conduct. Race is observed in discursive practices that interactively and influentially construct social relationships, personal identity, and academic knowledge. The author demonstrates the approach by illustrating how students manage problems and boundaries within commonplace classroom interactions.

Abstract = {This research was conducted in Singapore, a highly developed country with a relatively wealthy economy. The population of close to 5 million is multiracial, with Chinese, Indian, and Malay as the major ethnic groups. A large number of people live in Singapore on an immigration permit, which must be renewed annually. These people work in Singapore because of their particular employment, which has economic or other advantages to Singapore. The Singapore government has long recognized that it has limited natural resources and that its human resources are of prime importance. In 2001, some 16,414 children were enrolled in approximately 32 private foreign schools (Zoetmulder, 2003). Children who are neither raised entirely in their parents' home country nor as citizens of the country in which they currently reside are called third-culture children (TCC). These children are the focus of the research reported here. We investigated some aspects of TCC's adaptation to their new school during a specific period of 8 weeks, which was considered the minimum time for any change in children's transitions. We intended to investigate the following questions: (a) What are TCC's feelings when they enter an overseas school? and (b) What are TCC's feelings about the school after a transition period of 8 weeks?

Abstract = {More than 30 years after the first scholarship of its kind was produced, feminist studies of crime are more commonplace than ever before. Two recent milestone events--the 20th anniversary of the American Society of Criminology's Division on Women and Crime and the creation of this journal, the official publication of the division--provide the perfect opportunity to reflect on what lies ahead for feminist criminology. In this article, the author argues that the future of feminist criminology lies in our willingness to embrace a theoretical framework that recognizes multiple, intersecting inequalities. Specifically, the author maintains that to advance an understanding of gender, crime, and justice that achieves universal relevance and is free from the shortcomings of past ways of thinking, feminist criminologists must examine linkages between inequality and crime using an intersectional theoretical framework that is informed by multiracial feminism.

Becoming American should not mean leaving one's home language and identity at the schoolyard gate. Instead, our ESL and bilingual students need to become America--a multiracial, more compassionate society; a chorus of multivoiced, multitextured polyphony, enriched by multiethnic artistic and spiritual sensibilities as well as intellectual traditions from all over the world. TESOL/bilingual professionals of color have a role to play in the creation of this new society. Topics covered in this chapter include: early personal family history--immigration and the search for inclusion; legal segregation--wartime, peacetime, all the time; growing up multicultural--loss prevention; first teaching experiences--of pyramids and pass rates; exclusion at an early age--on the playground; dangerous discourses--racial profiling; and U.S. minorities in the TESOL profession--not the right material.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Race and Racism: An Introduction by Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban (see record [rid]2005-16415-000[/rid]). The author writes in the acknowledgment section that the book "is offered as a tribute to the many students of anthropology, African & African American studies on race course--to their courage to come into a class in which they know that sensitive matters of race and racism will be openly explored and discussed, and to their engagement with the many struggles to end racism, invigorated by a vision of a future multiracial society built on justice and equity" (p. viii). This is a tribute, indeed, and well worth the read for students of anthropology in particular and specialists in race-related research in general. Those who do not fall into either camp but who wish to learn more about the cultural and social underpinnings of race within historical and regional contexts will also be able to take something away from reading this book. If this sounds like a lot of ground for any book to cover, it is. The 278-page book contains illustrative photographs, a keyword index, and a number of pedagogical suggestions that make for teachable moments in any course covering matters pertaining to the study and discussion of race. There are several personal examples that the author uses throughout the text that help to position the material so that it is more readily grasped. Taken together, there are eight chapters in the book that are loosely linked and include discussion of the scientific meaning of race, anthropology's treatment of the subject, and the history of racism and its link to colonialism, intelligence testing, White privilege, and global comparisons of race. This is a book that contextualizes the research conducted by psychologists who study prejudice and racism. One minor criticism I had was with the author's periodic use of dry sarcasm.

Abstract = {How a family influences the career decision making of its members is often related to culturally specific factors. Exploring the relationship between cultural diversity and family influence helps counselors to understand the uniqueness of all clients. In the past 30 years, the population of the United States has seen a dramatic shift in its mixture of multiracial, multiethnic, and multiple language groups. Individual and cultural identities have diverged further with each generation while the homogeneity of a culture or ethnicity has been changed by intermarriage. Assumptions about work have shifted as people become more influenced by other cultures. Exploring cultural diversity and family influence allows for a deeper appreciation of the uniqueness of all clients and the cultures they came from and are now part of. Being aware of differential pressures on people and their responses to them adds to the essential knowledge and awareness that all career counselors need to become increasingly culturally sensitive and effective. In this article, a template is presented for career counselors to use when gathering information from a multicultural clientele. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Although the Mexican and other-Latino infants were of average weight when recruited at 1 month of age, the mothers in both subgroups estimated their infants as leaner, and indicated a heavier rating as desirable, relative to white mothers. They also reported a greater level of maternal 'pushiness' relative to the white mothers in terms of their attitude toward feeding their infants. Black mothers' estimates were generally in between these groups. These results raise the possibility that mothers who view a heavier infant as desirable might overfeed their infants in an effort to help them grow more rapidly.

Abstract = {The development of preventive interventions targeting adolescent problem behaviors requires a thorough understanding of risk and protective factors for such behaviors. However, few studies examine whether different cultural and ethnic groups share these factors. This study is an attempt to fill a gap in research by examining similarities and differences in risk factors across racial and ethnic groups. The social development model has shown promise in organizing predictors of problem behaviors. This article investigates whether a version of that model can be generalized to youth in different racial and ethnic groups (N = 2,055, age range from 11 to 15), including African American (n = 478), Asian Pacific Islander (API) American (n = 491), multiracial (n - 442), and European American (n = 644) youth. The results demonstrate that common risk factors can be applied to adolescents, regardless of their race and ethnicity. The findings also demonstrate that there are racial and ethnic differences in the magnitudes of relationships among factors that affect problem behaviors. Further study is warranted to develop a better understanding of these differential magnitudes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between multicultural competence and the demographic, experiential, and departmental characteristics of a multiracial, nationwide sample of faculty members in student affairs preparation programs. One hundred forty-seven student affairs preparation program faculty from 81 institutions were included in this study. Respondents included 76 females and 71 males. The mean age of the participants was 49.4 years. The mean score on the MC-SDS (social desirability scale) was 1.52. This was substantiated by correlation analysis that indicated that there was no relationship between social desirability and multicultural competence. Although these results are exploratory, they do provide some insight into the importance of continued professional development on multicultural issues for all student affairs preparation faculty. Additional information on faculty experience, the curriculum, and the climate of preparation programs is essential to further develop multicultural competence within the student affairs profession.

Abstract = {Review of the book Annual Review of Sociology (ARS), Volume 30, edited by Karen S. Cook and John Hagan (2004). The range of topics addressed in ARS is as extensive as the articles are substantive-the 2004 volume includes articles under such broad subheadings as Theory and Methods, Social Processes, Institutions and Culture, Political and Economic Sociology, Demography, and Policy. The volume's introductory chapter is Scott's Reflections on a Half- Century of Organizational Sociology. Other essays of note in this volume that the author found to be particularly interesting include Andrews and Edwards' "Advocacy Organizations in the U.S. Political Process," Jenness' "Explaining Criminalization: From Demography and Status Politics to Globalization and Modernization," and Lee and Bean's "America's Changing Color Lines: Immigration, Race/Ethnicity, and Multiracial Identification." It seems clear that the articles in ARS are largely oriented towards academics and researchers, although it may be that practitioners, managers, and policymakers may occasionally find some of the essays informative as well as interesting. Some of the articles are clearly too discipline-specific for a general readership. That said, however, this volume continues a long line in a series noted for publishing authoritative reviews on a given subject-and that in itself, makes the volume worth a look.

Compared to the overall U.S. population, Whites and Asian Americans were overrepresented, and African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans were underrepresented. There was limited information about how researchers gathered participants' race and ethnicity information and on factors that might inform participants' experience as racial and ethnic beings (e.g., racial and ethnic identity, generation status, acculturation).

Abstract = {The pimp's ubiquity in popular and youth culture belies its divergent interpretations along racial lines. This article is an ethnographic study of how adolescents at a multiracial urban high school vary in their performance and interpretation of the pimp and how they create racialized identities through these variations. All peer groups studied understood the pimp as representing sexual prowess, but for the African American peer group, the pimp more importantly represented manipulation and generalized power. Departing from Goffman's concepts of performance and stigma, the study illustrates the limitations of both in capturing the racializing and empowering aspects of the pimp persona for the African American students who enacted it. Merging symbolic interaction with the poststructuralist concepts of identity as lodged in discourse and with performance as transgression, this article explains how adolescents' pimp performances produced identities that were informed by white supremacist logic but also subverted this logic in their construction of racial differences.

Abstract = {Objectives: The objective of this work was to determine the prevalence, sociodemographic characteristics, and service utilization patterns of African American grandparents raising grandchildren compared with noncaregiving peers. Methods: Data were obtained from the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey/American Community Survey, a nationally representative survey of 890,000 households. Analysis was based upon comparison of 2,362 African American grandparent caregivers aged 45+ with 40,148 noncaregiving peers. Gender-specific analyses also were conducted. Results: Over 500,000 African Americans aged 45+ were estimated to be raising grandchildren in 2000. They were disproportionately female, younger, and less educated than noncaregivers and more likely to be living in poverty and receiving public assistance. Grandmother caregivers had significantly higher rates of functional limitations and poverty than either grandfather caregivers or other African American women aged 45+. Discussion: African American grandparent caregivers, particularly grandmothers, represent a highly vulnerable population economically. The finding that four-fifths of African American grandmother caregivers below the poverty line were not receiving public assistance underscores the need for improving program outreach and substance to better serve this population. The use of theories of intersectionality and multiracial feminism in future studies of grandparent caregiving should enhance our understanding of how the impact of race on gender varies by social class.

Abstract = {New pictures of ethnic families are emerging from the increasing diversity among families that now exists within the US. The challenges for family researchers are to develop accurate and timely knowledge about ethnic families so as to put them into a national context and to apply this knowledge to the particular theories that frame their research. In this chapter, we provide current information on family demographics as well as basic data on the population of ethnic families of color in the US to aid family theoreticians and researchers as they examine the dynamics of family interactions. We first provide a contemporary profile of ethnic families of color that scholars can incorporate into their theoretical thinking and writing. We then explain how theorizing about families of color is informed by the meaning of racial diversity beyond demography. We end the chapter with a brief discussion of the challenges that American families of color face today.

Abstract = {Whatever other changes it engenders, desegregation invariably produces a re-organization of space and place, a fact whose implications the psychological literature on the process has generally disregarded. The present article begins to address this gap. Drawing on research on place-identity processes, we argue that desegregation may alter not only the relationship between self and other, but also the relationship between self and place. As such, it may be experienced as a form of dislocation: an event that undermines shared constructions of place and the forms of located subjectivity they sustain. In order to develop this idea, we analyse a series of interviews conducted with holiday-makers on a formerly white but now multiracial beach in South Africa. The analysis demonstrates how white respondents' stories of desegregation evince an abiding concern with the loss of place, manifest in terms of an erosion of a sense of place belonging, attachment and familiarity and an undermining of the beach's capacity to act as a restorative environment of the self. The implications of such accounts for understanding personal and ideological resistance to desegregation are explored. The paper concludes by arguing that this problem provides an opportunity to conjoin environmental and social psychological work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Post-1965 demographic changes in the United States [US] have brought blacks, Latinos, and Asian Americans into direct conflict, raising the question of how and whether law and public policy should attempt to adjudicate conflicts among racialized minority groups. I argue in this article that for the past few decades, national political leaders in the US have promoted an official multiculturalist discourse that actually discourages Americans from naming and addressing these intergroup tensions. This discourse superficially reimagines race and nation - by moving from a biracial, black-white focus to a formal acknowledgment of multiracial difference - while refusing to acknowledge the complex interminority inequalities and antagonisms generated by this new diversity. How might we refocus national attention on the serious interminority conflicts and racial justice struggles unfolding around us? I consider resurrecting the traditional notion of racial hierarchy as a counter-narrative to official multiculturalist discourse before arguing instead for one which involves a more complex notion of "racial positionality".

Abstract = {Originally published in Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books, 2004, Vol 49(5), 583-586. Asian American Psychology: The Science of lives in Context (see record [rid]2002-18426-000[/rid]) presents a "picture of a developing science of Asian American Psychology" (p. 8). Chapters are ordered with increasing specificity so that broader topics are addressed in the beginning and later chapters deal with more specific and understudied issues in Asian American psychology. In particular, Chapters 1-3 discuss general methodological and conceptual issues as they relate to cultural orientation and development and span across Asian American populations, whereas later chapters deal with particular areas of importance in Asian American psychology, such as aging (Chapter 4), career (Chapter 5), violence (Chapter 6), and multiracial research (Chapter 7). The intended audience for this book includes scholars, students, and those interested in the social scientific approaches to Asian American psychology. The reviewers argue that one of the challenges of an edited book is finding a common ground across such varied and diverse chapters. At times it is hard to grasp how the specific topics were selected. Some readers may feel frustrated at the different directions presented in the book and desire a more cohesive conceptual and methodological framework. Others may feel a lack of a connection to some of the topics due to the fact that they are relatively understudied areas in Asian American psychology. However, perhaps one of the most important messages conveyed in this book is the fact that Asian Americans are a heterogeneous and complex racial group. What these chapters communicate is that to seek theoretical and methodological cohesion would be to simplify the experiences of this multifaceted group. Rather, the book coherently underscores the importance of social, cultural, familial, political, historical, interpersonal context and how it influences, creates, and shapes the psychological experience of Asian Americans. This goal is achieved by the authors by integrating key literature and research across a variety of academic disciplines. To embrace the multidimensionality and diversity of what it means to be Asian American is a more relevant and critical aim in understanding Asian American psychology. Although not always explicitly stated in the chapters, this book achieves this goal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Racial essentialism refers to the widely held belief that race is a biological, stable, and natural category. Although research finds very little evidence that race has biological underpinnings, racial essentialist beliefs persist and are linked to negative outgroup consequences. This study initially demonstrates that label and visual ambiguity concurrently inform racial categorization. It then tests whether exposure to racially ambiguous targets (a) challenges essentialism when ambiguous targets are labeled with biracial categories and (b) reinforces essentialism when ambiguous targets identify with monoracial categories. The results showed that White perceivers (N = 84) who were exposed to racially ambiguous, biracially labeled targets showed reductions in their essentialist thinking about race, whereas perceivers who were exposed to racially ambiguous, monoracially labeled targets showed increases in their essentialist beliefs.

In the urban CMHC that employs a multiracial staff to serve a multiracial community, these mandates are challenged and confronted by black staff in a historical situation of sharply increased black identity and militancy. In critical instances, black employees as well as the black community do not regard such mandates as operating fully in their behalf. The perceptions and experiences of black staff are quite real to them. The authors conclude that although white staff may believe that the Consortium treats black staff equitably, it is apparent that black employees do not share this belief, and their status and salary levels appear to give them some justification.

Abstract = {Reports on a conference of small group leaders at the spring meeting of the Transcultural Psychiatry Society, March 1983, that studied small, multiracial group experiences over 2 days in 10 groups. It was suggested that multiracial groups are best led by a pair of Black–White leaders. Findings from the group sessions demonstrate the effect of the group leader's perspective on subsequent group dynamics and the inability of some leaders to contain the emotions of the group or to provide the kind of psychotherapeutic "bringing together" that might have been expected. Several groups disintegrated. Black professionals who were in the majority at the conference expressed anger at such high levels that it was termed "verbal rioting." White members were unable to deal with guilt and anger without strong and compassionate leadership from a White leader who had personally experienced difficulties because of his/her own ethnic differences. Panel observations on these small group experiences show that they were able to bring together ideas reflecting their personal life, their work experience, and their hope for a multiracial society. A subsequent meeting of group leaders revealed the need to deal with fear, guilt, and anger. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

One of the settings, Taiwan, was relatively homogeneous in racial/ethnic makeup; the 2nd, Hong Kong, was nonstratified; the 3rd, the US, was stratified. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, Ss were Chinese; in the US they were Afro- and Euro-American. The major hypothesis was supported, because Taiwan and Hong Kong Ss differed from Afro- and Euro-American Ss on racial/ethnic preference, self-preference, and self-perception; from Euro-American Ss on classification ability; and from Afro-American Ss on self-classification. It is concluded that a crucial factor in the development of racial/ethnic identity was not so much whether the society was multiracial/ethnic or homogeneous, but whether racial/ethnic groupings in the multiracial/ethnic society were stratified.

Abstract = {To test the hypothesis that factors of racial differences may mediate the locus of control-achievement relationship, 80 Black and 80 White high school students were asked to cooperate with or compete against partners of within-race or opposite race. As hypothesized, the achievement behavior of internally (Locus of Control Scale) oriented Black Ss was more influenced by the race of the interactor and the competitive-cooperative expectancies in the task than that of the White Ss. While the achievement performance of internally oriented Blacks improved more than did the achievement of external Blacks, internal Blacks increased their performance most when competing against Whites or when cooperating with other Blacks. Findings have implications for classroom practice and achievement performance, especially in schools that have desegregated multiracial programs.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Consciousness-raising: A primer for multicultural counseling, 3rd edition by M. P. Parker and M. A. Fukuyama (2007). The third edition of Consciousness-Raising: A Primer for Multicultural Counseling is a good introduction to the reader interested in the impacts of multicultural issues in counseling. The plethora of case examples and discussion questions make it an effective teaching tool for raising consciousness of the unique differences of each client and how to approach and resolve these issues in a counseling relationship. The book is principally comprised of 10 chapters and two appendices. Chapter subjects include: introduction; questions and possible answers about key concepts; emotional preparation for consciousness-raising; racial identity development; understanding and counseling black males; establishing working alliances during the initial interview; counseling Latina(o) families; counseling multiracial people; role of spirituality in multicultural counseling; and, synthesis/conclusion. The first appendix is a glossary of key concepts and definitions. The second appendix is a description of a multicultural mentoring lab. The authors acknowledge that even as the book was sent to press, new research and ideas were and are emerging regarding multicultural counseling and the issues and techniques associated with it.

Abstract = {This study examines women's use of pregnancy-related medical care in Brazil and South Africa, two multiracial societies with very different histories of race-related legislation that could affect medical care utilization. The analysis uses nationally representative household-level data to show that inequality in the distribution of socioeconomic resources across racial groups and differences in the sociodemographic conditions surrounding individual pregnancies explain much of the racial difference in women's use of prenatal and delivery care in both countries. Even if these characteristics and resources were equalized across women however, the results suggest that non-White South African women would still be less likely than Whites to initiate prenatal care in the first trimester or to have a doctor present at the time of delivery. The mechanisms through which race works to influence the use of care are examined, and the Brazilian and South African contexts are discussed. These findings suggest that although state-sanctioned racism may help to explain the greater racial inequality in stunting in South Africa than in Brazil, reducing the disadvantage for non-Whites in South Africa and Brazil will depend on reducing fundamental inequalities in the distribution of socioeconomic resources and medical services that characterize many nations.

Abstract = {This article explores the implementation of empowerment zone (EZ) legislation in East Harlem, or what some describe as El Barrio in New York City. The EZ is used as a case study for a critique of tourism as an urban development strategy. El Barrio is difficult to market within a framework of tourism defined by EZ standards, especially the heightened conflicts that ensue as minority communities attempt to reconstitute their cultures for tourist aims. Ultimately, this article shows a growing contradiction between the disavowal of ethnicity and race as grounds for equity and empowerment and the fact that ethnicity and race are the bases on which urban spatial transformations are taking place. Furthermore, the case study suggests that the politicization (and mobilization) of race and ethnicity are not the greatest perils to intra-Latino and interracial alliances in U.S. cities or to people's aspirations regarding urban space at the local level. Rather, the ascendancy of neoliberal tenets presents obstacles to multiethnic and multiracial coalitions on behalf of livable and enjoyable communities for all people.

Abstract = {Scholars have examined the rising rate of inter-ethnic and inter-racial marriage from several different theoretical perspectives. While researchers have used these theories to examine intergroup marriage in some Western societies, we do not have comparable data from a broad range of societies. Such data would provide a useful basis for understanding global variability in intergroup interaction and marriage. In this paper we examine the intergroup marriage patterns in a highly segregated and racially conscious society, the country of South Africa. We then examine the relationship between socioeconomic status and inter-group marriage. We also examine inter-group marriages between linguistic groups. Finally, we examine the socioeconomic status of children born to multiracial couples in South Africa, thus projecting the implications of these marriages for the next generation.

Abstract = {Students' social competence was investigated in relation to race/ethnicity and gender for a sample of 371 Zimbabwean students attending racially/ethnically integrated schools. About 42% of the students were black, and 58% white (mean age 12 years; SD = 9 months). Peer and teacher sociometric ratings of children's social behaviour, social responsibility, and friendliness comprised the social competence measures. Tests of empirical independence among these social competence measures supported their uniqueness in reliably assessing components of the general construct of social competence among Zimbabwean students. Multiple analysis of variance procedures were used to examine the relationship between social competence statuses and group membership (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender) while controlling for aggregate scores and classroom racial proportions. Superior academic achievement and racial/ehnic propinquity are social status levelling factors in multiracial school settings. Teachers rated white students higher on social responsibility and social behaviour. Students rated white students higher on social responsibility only...

Abstract = {We examined the effect of varying degrees of obesity on the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its relation to insulin resistance and to C-reactive protein and adiponectin levels in a large, multiethnic, multiracial cohort of children and adolescents. We administered a standard glucose-tolerance test to 439 obese, 31 overweight, and 20 nonobese children and adolescents. Baseline measurements included blood pressure and plasma lipid, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin levels. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increased with the severity of obesity and reached 50 percent in severely obese youngsters. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increased significantly with increasing insulin resistance (P for trend, <0.001) after adjustment for race or ethnic group and the degree of obesity. C-reactive protein levels increased and adiponectin levels decreased with increasing obesity. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is high among obese children and adolescents, and it increases with worsening obesity. Biomarkers of an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes are already present in these youngsters. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: To identify and describe barriers to access to mental health services encountered by ethnoracial seniors. Method: A multiracial, multicultural, and multidisciplinary team including a community workgroup worked in partnership with seniors, families, and service providers in urban Toronto Chinese and Tamil communities to develop abroad, stratified sample of participants and to guide the study. This participatory, action-research project used qualitative methodology based on grounded theory to generate areas of inquiry. Each of 17 focus groups applied the same semistructured format and sequence of inquiry. Results: Key barriers to adequate care include inadequate numbers of trained and acceptable mental health workers, especially psychiatrists; limited awareness of mental disorders among all participants; limited understanding and capacity to negotiate the current system because of systemic barriers and lack of information; disturbance of family support structures; decline in individual self-worth; reliance on ethnospecific social agencies that are not designed or funded for formal mental health care; lack of services that combine ethnoracial, geriatric, and psychiatric care; inadequacy and unacceptability of interpreter services; reluctance of seniors and families to acknowledge mental health problems for fear of rejection and stigma; lack of appropriate professional responses; and inappropriate referral patterns. Conclusions: There is a clear need for more mental health workers from ethnic backgrounds, especially appropriately trained psychiatrists, and for upgrading the mental health service capacity of frontline agencies through training and core funding. Active community education programs are necessary to counter stigma and improve knowledge of mental disorders and available services. Mainstream services require acceptable and appropriate entry points. Mental health services need to be flexible enough to serve changing populations and to include services specific to ethnic groups, such as providing comprehensive care for seniors.

Abstract = {The intent of Brown v. Board of Education was to dismantle the system of apartheid that had structured U.S. schools. The Brown decision supported a race-conscious vision that students of color would have access to high quality education equal to that of white students, and that integrated schooling would build cross-racial communication and respect needed for a multiracial democracy. But 40 years after Brown, while students of color had made significant achievement gains, huge challenges remained. It is particularly ironic that U.S. federal legislation currently directs educators away from ethnography--away from insights based on ethnographic studies and away from use of qualitative inquiry as a tool to better understand local contexts and communities. It is a matter of great concern that policy makers have shoved aside valuable sources of insight about why students learn or fail to learn in schools, and what supports would enable students to succeed. Ethnographic work may be ignored in policy debates when ethnographers do not speak to the language of power. Currently that language is achievement scores. In order to insert work more directly into discussions of school reform, there is a need to link findings, where relevant, to achievement data.

This book--unlike other books on this subject--does not assume that therapists are White and clients are "minorities." The perspective adopted throughout this book is that therapists and clients are simply dissimilar in one or more important human variables. This book is divided into three broad sections. Part One delineates and establishes the importance of concepts, philosophies, and an array of relevant clinical issues when providing psychotherapeutic services to dissimilar clients. Part Two discusses the most visible racial or ethnic groups in the U.S.--Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans, Caucasians, Native Americans, Arab Americans, and Multiracial Groups. Part Three is dedicated to women, lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals, the disabled, and older adults--cultural groups often overlooked during discussions of multicultural diversity.

Abstract = {This four-volume set, The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination, takes a fresh look at that issue that is embedded in today's global environment. Images, attitudes and perceptions that sustain prejudice and discrimination are more covert, but no less pernicious. What people say, believe, and do all reflect underlying bias. We do not claim here to address every existing form of prejudice or discrimination, nor do we cite every possible group targeted today. What we offer are insights into a range from the most to least recognized, or openly discussed, forms of this injustice. Each chapter offers new perspectives on standing issues, with practical information about how to cope with prejudice and discrimination. The "toolbox" at the end of each chapter suggests steps to be taken at different levels to combat prejudice and discrimination and to achieve change. At the individual level, self-reflection needs to occur by both the victims and perpetrators of discrimination. Practitioners, educators, and all who deliver services potentially impart a bias perpetuating prejudice and discrimination. At the systems level, communities and policymakers must join together and have the will to combat discrimination. Volume 1, Racism in America, looks at stereotypes, racial bias, and race relations. Volume 2, Ethnicity and Multiracial Identity, looks at discrimination toward differences due to immigration, language, culture, and mixed race. Volume 3, Bias Based on Gender and Sexual Orientation, looks at gender bias, women's issues, homophobia, and oppression of gay/lesbian lifestyles. Volume 4, Disability, Religion, Physique, and Other Traits, strives to examine less-spotlighted bias against other forms of difference, and begins the difficult dialogue that must take place if we are to eradicate prejudice and discrimination.

The manuscripts presented in this issue articulate how today's students experience these issues.

Abstract = {As a result of a long history of both forced miscegenation and willing participation in interethnic relations, there now exists a growing group of people who closely identify with a racial or cultural group that is incongruent with their physical appearance. This can occur in one of three ways: (1) when someone is multiracial, and, therefore, not easily placed in a single racial/ethnic category, (2) when one physically resembles a racial/ethnic group other than his or her actual classification, or (3) when a person has acculturated to a racial/ethnic group other than his or her own. This paper addresses therapeutic and social concerns that are likely to emerge when counseling women fitting one of these three categories. To illustrate these factors, four case summaries of women experiencing distress directly and indirectly related to their ethnic/racial self-identification are presented, along with relevant social, interpersonal and emotional concerns.

Although results suggested that the biracial participants were receptive towards individuals of other races and more likely to appreciate differences, some participants had racial preferences regarding their choice of partners. Therapeutic considerations for professionals who work with biracial women are presented based on the findings from this study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in see record [rid]2004-10574-006[/rid].) Counseling research on racial identity development among multiracial people has largely overlooked the complexity of these individuals' social experiences and how their multiple realities result in various racial identities. The assumptions that individuals with one Black and one White parent can only understand themselves as "Black" or "biracial" have been socially, culturally and politically constructed, providing a misguided foundation for models of racial identity. Here, we present findings from a study of 177 biracial individuals that illustrate the multidimensionality of racial identity among this population. We focus on the mechanism of interactional validation in identity construction to better understand the particular dilemmas faced by biracial women and formulate appropriate therapeutic approaches.

Abstract = {After US slavery ended, the argument against intermarriage turned largely to science for rationalization, relying on different disciplines at different times to confirm the validity of predictions about the abnormality of so-called hybrids. Although there was some overlap, the source of scientific authority for the harmful effects of miscegenation shifted from medical doctors--who were also some of the earliest anthropologists--to geneticists and finally to social scientists, especially psychologists. Thus, the scientific opposition to interracial marriage has been informed by a series of shifting justifications, all of them without scientific merit. Psychology's interest in racial crosses emerged from this context, relying on perspectives that are either demonstrably false or constitutionally intolerable. None of this unfortunate history is meant to suggest that social scientists in general, and psychologists in particular, should avoid studying the host of interesting questions about the experience of multiracial individuals. But many of the previous approaches to these questions have been counterproductive for both science and society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Although a digit-sucking habit is common in preschool children, there is multiracial variation in prevalence rates. Hitherto unidentified variables are being reported as possible risk factors. To analyses this habit in preschool children in Enugu, Eastern Nigeria, a prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on one hundred (100) children. Their mothers were interviewed with a structured questionnaire. The habit was noted in 23% of the children, with a slight male preponderance. Using the correlation coefficient model, longer total duration of breast-feeding was not well correlated with increase in number of digit-sucking preschool children (correlation coefficient, r=0.36, P < 0.05). The number of these children exposed to pacifier sucking was significantly greater than the number of their non-sucking counterparts with similar exposure (χ²=38.56, P < 0.05). It is concluded that preschool children exposed to pacifier use and shorter duration of breast-feeding were more likely to exhibit the habit.

Abstract = {Adoption provides a unique opportunity for the study of child development. Because adopted children are raised in families in which they have no genetic relationship with their parents, and possibly none with their siblings, they provide a rare opportunity to study the relative importance of genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental influences on the development of child characteristics and behaviors. Because children are adopted from a variety of circumstances and at a wide range of ages, studies of adopted children and their families provide researchers the opportunity to examine the short- and long-term influences of a wide range of environments on children's development. Because children are adopted into homes with a range of characteristics (e.g., multiracial homes), adoption provides the opportunity to study the range of influences of these homes on child development. Adoption research that focuses on each of these areas is reviewed in this article. We present conclusions about the value of adoption in psychological research and some reasons why many psychologists ignore the opportunities presented by studying adoptive families, as well as potential useful directions for future research with adopted children and their families.

Abstract = {Drawing from four years of field studies in a racially and ethnically diverse congregation of the International Churches of Christ (ICOC), I address a process about which we know relatively little: the construction and maintenance of multiracial/ethnic networks in high-boundary religious movements. I demonstrate how this type of group is particularly able to present a valuable and rising commodity in our U.S. religious economy, what I have named intimate diversity--the enactment and/or narration of close and caring relationships among a racially and ethnically diverse membership. My comparative analysis here of the ICOC, the People's Temple, and contemporary U.S. Bahá'í communities suggests that membership in such groups offers members greater exposure and involvement with people from different backgrounds, but the terms of involvement in the organization seriously limit and define the manner in which individuals can experience diversity. Furthermore, group commitment to present a face of intimate diversity and strict mechanisms of social control hinder the abilities of the leadership and members to clearly recognize contradictions in group racial/ethnic ideologies and practice.

Abstract = {Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons, Latter-Day Saints, or LDS) are sometimes thought of as a monolithic block of economic and social conservatives. This article addresses whether this is caused by strong religious effects, or whether it is an artifact of unrepresentative sampling. Q methodology is used to identify six "types" of political worldviews among a multinational and multiracial sample of active Latter-Day Saints. The six types reveal some interesting ideological variations among Mormons, particularly on economic issues, and even some unique LDS issues. A second-order factor analysis indicates a high level of commonality across types on social issues, but important differences on orientation toward government. I conclude that the failure to include racial and cultural variation in Mormon samples has led us to overestimate the otherwise significant influence of LDS doctrine on members' political views.

Tower Hamlets is a multiracial area in East London, which according to the 1991 census has high levels of poverty, overcrowding and unemployment. Increasing poverty and social exclusion, which further entrench inequalities in health, are reported by sources such as Government, health and social services departments as requiring innovative local responses to meet pressing welfare needs. Innovative projects are especially urgent with vulnerable families whose experiences of racism, bullying, mental health difficulties, domestic violence and child abuse are the rule rather than the exception. In common with other initiatives in the United Kingdom and abroad, the FSS aims to be non-stigmatizing, non-intrusive and responsive to the ethnicity, views and specific needs of families.

These practices and assumptions are then juxtaposed against competing ideals of the human rights movement, the democratization of psychotherapy, and the ethos of postmodernism and social constructionism. The book is divided into three sections. Part I, "Apartheid-Style Psychology," illustrates how professional training for mental health practitioners is generally inadequate on matters pertaining to race and racism and how therapists may be influenced by prevailing racist ideologies, unaware of how their racial and cultural prejudices translate into discriminatory work practices and ignorant of the power of their own elite discourses. Part II, "Alternatives to Apartheid-Style Psychology," investigates positions related to racial and cultural sensitivity that stand in contradiction to the negative and disruptive positions identified in Part I. Part III, "Training Models," describes the Triad Model and proposes a new multicultural and multiracial sensitivity training model for further research. The Afterword summarizes some of the main points of the book and suggests areas for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (preface)},

Abstract = {The goal of this chapter is to articulate the rationale and the process needed to develop an ecological theory of cultural identity development. To achieve that goal, we will present the core ideas behind the ecological perspective. That perspective will then be used to discuss the strengths and limitations of current models of cultural identity development, using the racial identity literature as the primary example. It will be our contention that these models, as currently formulated, contribute greatly to our understanding of the processes through which individuals acquire a sense of their cultural identity (i.e., their sense of themselves as a member of a group within their social context). There are limitations, however, to these formulations, and these might be addressed through the development of an ecological perspective. To support this contention, we will use the issues raised by our understanding of how multiracial individuals acquire and develop a sense of racial identity to demonstrate the limitations of current models and, concurrently, the advantages of an ecological perspective on the process of cultural identity development. In social science, a shift in perspective is often accompanied by a shift in methodological focus. In this chapter, we will also outline how a different methodological approach to examine cultural identity development will enhance our understanding of that process. Our conclusion will articulate ideas for future research in this area of human development. It is our core assumption that a sophisticated understanding of cultural identity development is the basic building block of multicultural competence.

Abstract = {Discusses a street life in an apartheid city. In South Africa, Black politics is tied to the past and present, and are rooted in the history and politics of anti-racism. The authors discuss the moment when the term 'Black' was used to refer to the common experience of racism and marginalisation, and the idea of 'Blackness' was embraced by a portion of the Indian population from the 1950s to the 1970s. As a political identity, it was in its encounter with white racism that an 'Indian' identity emerged. Indian South Africans resented being treated as second-class citizens, although their resentment was probably not as extreme as that of Africans. The apartheid system cemented a division of labour and citizenship on a racial and ethnic basis, which resulted in the development of ontological commitments to racialised and ethnic identities. The politics of resistance is an important part of the vision of what is possible in racial cities. It is imperative that South Africans do not stigmatise the Black underclass and articulate a new technocratic and elite cartel under the guise of democracy. It is argued that the people of this rainbow nation need more than a normalised and non-racial yet multiracial elite domination. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Even though Brazil is a multiracial and miscegenetic country, the lowest levels of the social pyramid have always been occupied by its Black citizens who represent almost half of the Brazilian population. Therefore, the idea that people have about Blacks is that they are ugly, dirty and weak: the image of failure. In this article the authors have considered the effects that are caused by this imaginary psychic register which has been historically produced on the psyche of the Black Brazilian. Although psychoanalysis has had significant influence on mental health in Brazil, it has made little or no contribution to the understanding of this matter. To further comprehension of this enigma, the authors pose the question: what does a psychoanalyst hear when a Black person speaks? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Ethnographic details from the psychedelic rave tourism scene in Goa, India, are presented to account for what could happen when differences between bodies at a rave event are considered. In the final theoretical section, drawing on Merleau-Ponty and Defeuze and Guattari, these ethnographic details are used to make some tentative suggestions as to how music is capable of organizing 'factions' of bodies along dynamic socio-spatial boundaries. The main argument is that it is not music itself, but its material connections to bodies, spacetimes and objects, that enable social differentiation in the multiracial touristic environment of Goa.

All individuals aged 5-20 who were enrolled in grades K-12 were included in the sample. In areas with few immigrants, LEP students do not "crowd" the schools attended by most African American and non-Hispanic white children. In areas with a significant LEP population, a pattern of segregation emerges between non-Hispanic white students, on the one hand, and LEP and African American students, on the other. In California, LEP students are represented in schools attended by average African Americans at about twice the level as schools attended by average non-Hispanic whites. At the same time, non-Hispanic whites are greatly underrepresented in African American students' schools. This pattern is particularly strong in metropolitan statistical areas and school districts where the LEP student population reaches about 10 percent, even after MSA and district composition are taken into account.

The authors contend that this is the 1st effort to creatively test the ability of young children to reliably report on the psychological control they perceive from their parents (mothers aged 24-51 yrs). Their findings provide initial evidence that young children have this capability. Although the authors find no direct link between their new measure of parental psychological control and child functioning (perhaps because of their small sample size), they do find an interesting interaction between parenting and child temperament: Psychological control was related to internalizing and externalizing problems for children high in temperamental negative reactivity.

Abstract = {This article examines the positioning of learners in six newly integrated primary and secondary schools in the Durban area. Drawing on data gathered through classroom observations, teacher and principal interviews, school documents and policies, and classroom materials and textbooks, the authors explore the various ways in which the students in these multiracial schools are given an identity. They argue that although there is some attempt to recognize the students' ethnic and linguistic background, by and large, school personnel through their school policies, methods, and materials are not promoting the multilingualism and multiculturalism explicitly advocated in the new South African language-in-education policy. Rather, three discourses--an English-only discourse, a decline-of-standards discourse, and a one-at-a-time discourse--serve to marginalize the use of Zulu and the multiculturalism of the student population.

Additional collected data included classroom observations. Results show that subjects (Ss) consistently denied the local salience of race and there was little multicultural history taught.

The 162 female respondents (mean age 22 yrs, 84% Caucasian, 1% Asian American, 10% Hispanic, 4% African American, and 1% Multiracial) completed a questionnaire packet to assess each of the factors. Results revealed that romantic love was unrelated to friend support, friend interference, or parental interference, but positively related to parental support. Parent support was a significant correlate of parent satisfaction, and a similar pattern emerged between friend support/friendship satisfaction. Further, best friend support moderated the relationship between friend interference and friendship satisfaction, such that interference was negatively related to satisfaction in low support conditions. Overall, the results suggested that network reactions to romance played a limited role in romantic affection, but were more strongly associated with network satisfaction.

Asian-American Ss' course enrollment in TM and TF courses was more balanced than enrollments by non-Asian American Ss, and Asian-American Ss endorsed fewer internal reasons than did non-Asian Americans. Ss in TM classes endorsed more external reasons for course choice than did Ss in TF classes.

Abstract = {For the past 18 yrs, the authors have engaged in a program of research designed to improve the literacy of poor culturally and linguistically diverse students and English language learners (ELL) in urban elementary schools. Intervention research has addressed the issue of what works best, how it can be applied and sustained schoolwide, and how computer and information management technology can improve quality and reduce teachers' work loads. The net product of this research is the ClassWide Peer Tutoring Learning Management System (CWPT-LMS). In this article, the authors report on use of the CWPT-LMS in the literacy instruction of elementary-level ELL. Five ELL teachers and 117 students (1st–5th graders) in a multiracial/multiethnic urban elementary school, including students with disabilities, participated in the study. Results indicated that ELL made considerable progress in mastering the curriculum over periods ranging from 15 to 21 wks of school across teachers, teachers implemented CWPT to high standards of fidelity, students' and teachers' satisfaction with the CWPT program was high, and consultation improved program implementation and student outcomes of all but 1 classroom. Implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, the United States President's Initiative on Race (1998) concluded that the greatest challenge facing North Americans is to accept and take pride in defining themselves as a multiracial democracy.

By relying on 2 case studies of community-based organizations for girls, 1 exclusively White and working class and the other expressly multicultural and antiracist, the authors try to identify those structures and practices that support feminist, but inadvertently racist, work and those structures and practices that enable feminist and antiracist consciousness and praxis. Participant observations and individual and focus group interviews were conducted in the Girls Club with poor White middle school girls, White residents, 10 teachers, and 13 community staff. Data were collected from the antiviolence center primarily from participant observation, archival research, 4 interviews with 3 staff members and 10 interviews with a multiracial group of self-defense students. Across both settings, the authors witnessed the micropolitics of gendered community building via the creation of safe spaces from girls and women's body work and talk about male violence without fear of harassment.

A multiracial sample of adults (N = 4,025) was used to examine neighborhood racial composition preferences—an important, individual-level explanation for residential segregation—and address 3 shortcomings in existing research. The author extended analysis of the cause of preferences beyond racial stereotypes to include parenting, homeownership, perceptions of social class difference, and common fate identity. Also tested, directly, were the effects of these factors on preferences for same-race neighbors. Results lend strong support to race-based explanations of preferences. As stereotypes toward out-groups became more negative, preferences for integration decreased; Blacks were consistently perceived in unfavorable terms, and were, consensually, the least preferred out-group neighbors. There was also limited support for so-called class-based explanations of preferences, homeowners preferred fewer Black neighbors. Generally, results suggest both greater resistance to integration with Blacks than previously thought, but more openness to integration than currently exists.

Reviews Sexually Abused and Abusing Children in Substitute Care (see record [rid]1998-06717-000[/rid]). This book summarizes a qualitative study based on case file reviews with a total of 96 children 10 to 14 years of age and additional two-hour interviews with 40 of these children. These samples were multiracial and drawn from 250 children living in two social service authorities. The book summarizes one study in a series about various aspects of residential care for maltreated children in the United Kingdom. The authors address sexual behavior problems in children and young adolescents at a more in-depth level than the reviewer has ever seen. The range of sexual behavior problems that these children exhibit is quite broad, and many policy recommendations are made to address such problems. The author concludes that this book is an excellent combination of research-based information based on a topic that suffers from a dearth of empiricism. The book will be useful for researchers and practitioners alike, and it is hoped that it comes to the attention of social workers and their supervisors as well as policy developers for children.

Abstract = {Tested whether elders substitute religious media use for church attendance when health declines (using multidimensional disengagement theory) with data from a multiracial, population-based sample of 2,971 Ss in the Bible Belt. Face-to-face baseline interviews were conducted in the respondents' homes during 1986, and in-person follow-up interviews took place 3 yrs later. In adjusted models, 3-yr declines in functional status were significantly associated with concurrent reduction in frequency of church attendance but not with any change in rates of religious media (TV/radio) use. Age-related declines in church attendance were substantively explained by declining functional ability. Changes in religious media use were independent of age and less sensitive to declining functional status or service attendance than to cultural heritage such as race, SES, and rural upbringing. Data do not support the hypothesis that elders with deteriorating health substitute increased engagement with religious media as their participation in organizational religious activities is reduced. However, applicability of the substitution hypothesis to other dimensions of nonorganizational religiousness (e.g., prayer) awaits similar scrutiny.

Abstract = {A national survey was conducted to (a) ascertain the status of HIV prevention among community-based organizations targeting Asians and Pacific Islanders (APIs) in the US, (b) define technical assistance needs among these organizations, and (c) determine their involvement in the HIV community planning process. Filipinos, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and multiracials were the subpopulations targeted the most often. Gay men, bisexual men, and youth were targeted most frequently by HIV prevention efforts. Of all the largest ethnic subpopulations, Asian Indian is the only group with no community-based organization that exclusively targets them for HIV prevention. More than 95% of respondents reported conducting some type of evaluation; the size of the budget and organization often determined the evaluation strategies used. Program development, staff development, and program evaluation were the most frequently reported areas of technical assistance requested. A majority of the respondents reported being involved with the HIV prevention community planning process where APIs were represented on state/local community planning groups, they did not rate the performance of the community planning process highly.

Abstract = {Investigated the use of a hands-on lab program as a means of improving student attitude toward science and increasing student achievement levels in science knowledge, using a posttest only control group design. Students were 9th graders from multiracial and multiethnic backgrounds in a large urban high school. Ss were randomly assigned to 20 physical science classes, including 6 classes containing immigrant students with limited English proficiency (LEP). There were two experimental groups of LEP and regular students who received the lab program, and two similar control groups who did not take part in the lab program. Curriculum referenced objective exams were used to measure student achievement in science knowledge, and a posttest Q-sort survey was used to measure student attitude toward science. An analysis of variance and analysis of covariance showed a significant difference between experimental Ss who scored higher than controls in achievement in science knowledge and attitude toward science. There were no significant differences between the LEP Ss in achievement and attitude toward science. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Making the claim that "White is a color," this book brings an analysis of the White racialization process to the multicultural discussion. The contributors hail primarily from the fields of education and psychology but draw from the arenas of critical race theory, feminism, cultural studies, queer theory, and postcolonial thinking to argue that White identity, class, and sexuality are essential sites for studying racism. The opening section explodes the concept of Whiteness by examining how it is embodied and institutionalized in schools and workplaces. Contributors "out" their institutions in order to reveal how racism is firmly established in institutional structures, policies, relationships, and identities. Other essays tackle the privileges associated with Whiteness; pro-White racism; White, working class men's narratives; how Whiteness is embedded in intimacy; and the implications of Whiteness in print and media. The book concludes with a look at the possibilities that lie within multiracial ethnic coalition work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (cover)},

Abstract = {Examined (1) actual and perceived differences in economic status, (2) mutual preference for same race neighbors, and (3) racial prejudice and discrimination as causes of racial residential segregation in the multiracial social context of Los Angeles. Data were drawn from the 1993–1994 Los Angeles Survey of Urban Inequality, a face-to-face household survey of adults 21+yrs. There were a total of 4,025 respondents (68%). There were 8653 Whites, 1,119 Blacks, 988 Latinos, and 1,055 Asians. No support was found for actual or perceived cost of housing as a barrier to integration. Although all groups exhibit some degree of ethnocentric preference for same race neighbors, this tendency is strongest among Whites rather than Blacks and plays only a small role in perpetuating segregation. Blacks face the greatest hostility in the search for housing and are consensually recognized as the most likely to face discrimination in the housing market. Racial minorities are more open to sharing residential space with Whites than with other minorities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

US citizens, like others abroad, will need to be responsive to the demands of a multiethnic, multiracial, and multinational society. The challenges of this changing world can and will range from such dilemmas as ethical decisions of who can and will have access to expensive technology that saves and prolongs life; to the development of conflict management strategies for peaceful coexistence with neighbors whose behaviors, beliefs, and values are strongly shaped by their religious, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds and socioeconomic circumstances.

Abstract = {Used the theoretical framework of the Health Belief Model to explore the effects of race/ethnicity on utilization in a multiracial, multiethnic, random sample of 1,011 women (aged 65+ yrs). Race/ethnicity; belief that mammograms detect cancer, ease the mind, and provide accurate results; concern over the radiation, pain, and cost associated with receiving a mammogram; and other independent variables were tested as predictors of screening mammography utilization. Regression analysis identified that the belief that having a mammogram eases recipients' minds was the most significant predictor of screening mammography utilization. None of the other health beliefs or health concerns were significant predictors. Race/ethnicity had no direct effects on utilization nor was it a confounder in the relationship between health beliefs, concerns and utilization. These results indicate that, along with emphasizing the importance of mammograms in early detection of breast cancer, stressing the reassurance that mammography brings recipients may be an effective health education strategy for elderly women of different racial/ethnic backgrounds.

It contributes to the literature that urges awareness, understanding and acceptance between people of different cultural, racial and linguistic origins.  The dimensions of race and culture are extremely complex and have many consequences in therapy. Wherever persons of different races and cultures come together in a counseling relationship, some of their interactions will be an unknown quantity, each may experience discomfort and fear and the results, for both parties, might be negative.

The focus was on how children manipulate their parents to conform to their desires for money over and above the normal amount of pocket money available to them. The research took place in 2 schools, one a rural village school with 60 children, the other a multiracial inner-city school with 250 children. The picture that emerges shows children with a clear sense of self and the ability to participate in arguments with their parents in a way that ensures they get things for themselves.

Abstract = {Reports the findings of a British, 12-yr follow-up study (C. Bagley et al, 1979) of 27 Afro-Caribbean and mixed-race children (mean age 19 yrs) adopted by Caucasian parents, and 25 Caucasian children (mean age 19.2 yrs) adopted by same-race parents. Ss completed questionnaires, including the Crown-Crisp Experiential Index, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventories, and a measure of identity. Outcomes for both groups of adoptees in terms of adjustment and identity were generally excellent, although 10% of both groups had poor adjustment. There was no evidence from this or other studies that intercultural identity leads to unfavorable adjustment. Ss seemed well prepared by transracial adoption to participate effectively in a multicultural, multiracial society. Transracial adoptions should be considered for all children who cannot be placed inracially. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {As we move toward the 21st century, policymakers, researchers, and family life educators will be confronted with at least three important trends that will challenge the future existence and stability of families in the United States. First, the family is changing in structure and in composition, and is being redefined in legal terms as well. Second, the economic status of families has been on a steady decline that will probably continue for several decades. And third, major demographic shifts are producing a society that is more multiracial and older. Discussed here are the implications of these trends and recommendations for addressing them.

Program culture is analyzed in terms of curriculum, structural composition, and clinical components of practice. Although content in the training program plays a viable role in the preparation of racially sensitive therapists, overemphasis on content limits opportunities to gain awareness in other integral ways. To augment content on Black families, programs should incorporate experiential exercises into the curriculum. The "cultural genogram" or "racial storytelling" can be used to enable students to experience the intensity of cross-racial interactions in our society. To establish a new paradigm for racially sensitive programs, curricula must also include elements of introspection, multiracial contact, and heightened racial self-awareness.

Informant reports suggest that Panjabi crossing was common, though assessments varied according to its contexts of occurrence. Analysis of spontaneous speech indicated 2 major contexts: (1) agonistic interactions in which Panjabi played an auxiliary role in familiar playground practices, primarily among males (n = 40) and (2) bhangra, in which predominantly White females (n = 6) looked toward a nascent youth culture with Panjabi at its core. Despite major differences, bilingual sponsors and nonconversational structures were crucial in both settings. Multiracial Panjabi was very much a language of local association and seemed more likely to be linked to the development of pluralist, antiracist understandings.

Black Ss preferred black dolls to white dolls and white Ss preferred white dolls to black dolls. However, white Ss in multiracial schools preferred white dolls significantly less than white Ss in monoracial schools.

This is a well-written, comprehensive, interesting book authored by two self-proclaimed antiracism-activist social workers that takes an indepth look at racism in the United States. The only flaw is the lack of psychiatric perspective- for example, the American Psychiatric Association's position on racism (1) and other psychiatric perspectives (2). Beginning with a very nice conversational introduction framing the content, each chapter ends with individual, interpersonal, group, and organizational exercises that make grappling with this subject easier. Thirteen chapters supply outstanding text and visual representations of how racism operates. Material on the New Deal, Great Depression, civil rights movement, and die Great Society adequately covers the historical context of racism and explains that racial exploitation and subjugation built the United States. There is good advice for clinicians who identify as white, as people of color, or as multiracial. Finally, the authors discuss how to dismantle racism by creating a web of resistance.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, "Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption," by Randall Kennedy. This book analyzes intimate relationships between blacks and whites from the antebellum days of slavery to the present day in the United States. Additionally, and probably of most relevance to practicing child psychiatrists, the author seeks to provoke readers to form opinions on transracial adoption issues that continue to challenge United States child foster care and adoption systems today. This book will offer the reader new understandings and a different perspective on black-white relationships and the important contemporary issue of transracial adoption in the United States. Its second section is particularly germane to child psychiatrists, as it highlights the crisis facing our foster care system. One hopes that this welcome volume will call to action the caring persons needed to help the many children suffering within the system. It does have shortcomings, although few in number for such a large text. Perhaps most obviously, the title misleads the reader in that the book almost exclusively focuses on black-white relationship and adoption issues, while neglecting other multiracial ties.

The study by Okosun et al. provides further evidence that clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors has its origin in childhood and varies according to race/ethnicity. The documented rise in fasting blood glucose levels in this adolescent cohort is concerning because of the implication of increased risk for type 2 diabetes, despite documented improvements in lipid profiles and mean arterial blood pressures. Further prospective multicenter research in a diverse racial/ethnic population is needed to determine whether a constellation of clinical findings along with traditional and novel biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease will allow for accurate prediction of risk and early diagnosis of comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and subclinical cardiovascular disease in clinical practice.

Two studies examine how two status-related factors—race and social class—influence identity choice. While a majority of mixed-race participants identified as biracial in both studies, those who were members of groups with higher status in American society were more likely than those who were members of groups with lower status to claim a biracial identity. Specifically, (a) Asian/White individuals were more likely than Black/White or Latino/White individuals to identify as biracial and (b) mixed-race people from middle-class backgrounds were more likely than those from working-class backgrounds to identify as biracial. These results suggest that claiming a biracial identity is a choice that is more available to those with higher status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

For researchers in all fields that take a sociocultural perspective on human behavior, this book provides an essential orientation to the construction of race and ethnicity in a mass-mediated society. The first two chapters offer analyses of racial diversity and the media that provide essential grounding for the rest of the book. Wilson and Gutiérrez provide a comprehensive introduction to race, multiculturalism, and the media that is both accessible and enjoyable to read. At times the authors seem overly optimistic about the potential for class-targeted media to increase the media access of African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans and improve the media coverage of their communities. However, their study provides "strategies for coping" in a multiracial and multicultural society, along with resources for analyzing the construction of race and ethnicity in American culture, that promise to be useful tools for a broad range of social and psychological researchers.

This special issue of Gender and History takes as its point of departure the absence of gender from recent examinations of the construction of nations and national identities, particularly in the influential work of Benedict Anderson. Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism. Of necessity, these papers examine not only the significance of gender, but the intersections of gender and race, especially in Australia, the United States, and Britain, where statebuilding in multiracial and multiethnic societies also meant the establishment of racial domination. The process of differentiation and displacement that was part of the American and Australian establishment of White domination and national sovereignty over and against indigenous peoples also appeared in the definition of British national identity. These essays point to new ways of thinking about statebuilding, the eonstrnction of national identity, nationalism and gender in, both, East and West. Collectively, they raise two issues for further thought. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This latest edition (see record [rid]2002-06787-000[/rid]) offers a contemporary expansion of the definition of multicultural counseling that pushes the boundaries of the field and allows for a more inclusive and meaningful way of looking at and treating diverse populations. The authors have updated the book to include new developments in research, theory, and practice. Major additions include: a more expansive definition of multiculturalism; the most recent statistics on the changing complexion of society; and implications for counseling and clinical practice that these changes have precipitated, which are forcing clinicians to redefine their roles and reeducate themselves on how to tend to these varied populations. The book includes new chapters on counseling biracial/multiracial populations, women, gays/lesbians, the physically challenged, the elderly, and monocultural organizations; a new section in every chapter covering implications for clinical practice; updated chapters on counseling African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. The reviewer concludes that the book combines a sound conceptual framework for multicultural counseling with proven therapeutic methods for specific populations.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, The World We Created at Hamilton High by Gerald Grant (1988). Grant argues that 'too many educational reports lacked historical perspective'. In this book he tries to correct that by describing life for staff and pupils at Hamilton High from its opening in 1953 until 1987. The book is in two halves. In the first part Grant gives us the history of Hamilton High from the pre Korean Happy Days era, through the turmoil of the late 1960s and 1970s into the multiracial peace of the 1980s. The second half is more philosophical and speculative. The division is unhelpful, in that many data which would have illuminated the first half are only presented in the second. From the book as a whole, however, a depressing picture of American high schools emerges, and the rest of this review focuses on reasons for the malaise. The second finding from Grant's work which goes a long way to explain low academic achievement concerns part-time employment. The third body of data in Grant's book which explain low levels of scholarship concerns drug abuse. Thus, we can enjoy the rich data in this volume without subscribing to that vapid conclusion.

Results of factor and regression analyses indicate that 2 types of observed interracial behavior were associated with different classroom environments. Diffuse positive intergroup contacts were more likely to occur in classes in which teachers emphasized interpersonal concerns. Although businesslike environments impeded overall cross-racial association, they had no effect on more purposeful intergroup contacts, which were facilitated by teacher patience and by diversity in instructional arrangements. These findings suggest that tensions between the social and academic objectives of multiracial education might be resolved by emphasizing purposeful interactions among children of different racial backgrounds.

Based on the percentage of positive and negative responses, for all concepts except "Spanish," positive responses were significant. Ss gave preference to concepts related to their own group and displayed negativism toward each other. With the exception of Mexican-Americans, Ss in monoracial schools were more positive toward their own group. Results imply that racially mixed schools do not necessarily promote positive racial attitudes, nor do monoracial schools necessarily promote negative attitudes.

Results indicate the following: Migration to Britain has forced the West Indian household to a more nuclear family structure and thus a redefinition of all roles within the family. Adolescents feel that their parents are operating in 2 worlds—the West Indian and the English—with a resulting disjointed view of life. Thus, the gulf between the adolescent and his parents is larger than in the homeland. Further, while the church has provided 1st generation West Indians with a sense of belonging and pride in the commmunity, most adolescents consider the church to have fostered a false and unattainable value system. Finally, there appears to be high self-esteem among West Indian adolescents, which may be due to their greater emphasis on and awareness of the need to create and identify with a distinctive cultural heritage.

In multiracial societies characterized by racial inequality, news stories serve to orient the public to racial groups, their social status, structural location, and level of participation in general society. The professional, organizational, and practical processes that structure news stories about racial inequality rely on professional values and organizational practices that define and reinforce cultural boundaries. The processes of news creation and construction involve ideological production and assumptions that become the basis for public knowledge and information. These factors are evidenced in a content analysis of a TV series on Black life that examined the family, crime, education, the absence of Black men, and the urban underclass.

It is suggested that educators should be aware that books, authors, or programs that are billed as multicultural education may be advocating quite different things.

The Mobilization Support Network in San Francisco provided a consultant who identified the needs of a multiracial community coalition to provide a foundation for unity, draw up an implementation plan, conduct a neighborhood campaign, evaluate regularly, and set up a workshop for strategies and goals under skilled leadership. The goal of radical therapy is to realize a contractual agreement with the facilitator of the group; the 2nd step is to acquire mobilization skills, including separating judgments from observations, identifying feelings and emotions, and stating desires clearly. A workshop using these skills lessened tensions in a biracial organization. A collective business experiencing verbal battles and general tension was helped when mediation resulted in agreements to equalize verbal skills, hold 2 weekly meetings, and to use communication and empathetic listening skills in the meetings and workplace.

Abstract = {50 male and 50 female undergraduates were administered the Adjective Check List (ACL) to assess sex-trait stereotypes in Malaysian society. Analyses of data revealed a perceived distinction between males and females in 5 main areas: dominance, competence, extraversion, intelligence, and nurturance. Specifically, (1) men were perceived as dominant while women were depicted as submissive and childlike; (2) men were attributed a certain level of general, social, and psychological competence that was lacking in the characterization of women; (3) men were viewed as extroverted and sociable and as having a strong sexual interest while women were perceived as introverted and unsociable with diminished sexual needs; (4) men were described as intelligent and clear-thinking while women were perceived as unintelligent and confused; and (5) men were characterized as cold and unemotional and women as warm and loving. Results of an affective meaning analysis indicated that the male stereotype was evaluated more favorably than the female stereotype and that the male items on the ACL were perceived as substantially more active and stronger than the female items. Sex-trait distinctions are discussed in terms of the traditions, beliefs, and values found in the multiracial Malaysian society.

Ss were 398 pupils of English, 250 of West Indian, and 149 of Asian origin. Results indicate that while Ss were most friendly to classmates of their own-race group and sex, they were also more friendly to classmates of the same sex, regardless of race, than to classmates of the same race but other sex. Sex was a more important determining influence on the ratings than race. Results also indicate that the relationship between age and own-race group friendship tendencies may be curvilinear, with the maximum of the curve being reached at about the ages of 13 or 14. With regard to friendship tendencies toward some other-race group, the evidence suggests that there may well be a similar curve with the maximum being reached slightly earlier or later depending on the particular race group and sex.

Data indicate that Ss were all left hemisphere dominant for the languages tested; no consistent evidence for increased participation by the right hemisphere for language functions was found. The cortical stimulation experiments provided data most compatible with the "differential localization" model of cerebral localization in bilingualism.

Abstract = {In the present study we aimed to construct a process model of union loyalty. Various personal, work, and union-related variables were hypothesized to predict union loyalty, which in turn would cause greater participation in essential union activities. Furthermore, the study assessed whether different models of union loyalty existed for 169 Black and 139 White members of a multiracial South African union. For both samples, cross-lagged regression analyses showed that union loyalty caused greater formal participation in union activities. Separate path analyses demonstrated that perceptions of union instrumentality, extrinsic job dissatisfaction, and early socialization experiences predicted union loyalty in both samples. However, the nature and strength of several relationships between the antecedent variables and union loyalty were moderated by race. In further refinement of the model, perceived union instrumentality was found to moderate the relationship between union loyalty and union participation, and the relationships between the predictor variables and union loyalty.

Although there is recent agreement among mental health workers on the necessity to attend to racial differences in a therapeutic situation, 2 extreme interpretations of the effect of these differences have resulted-"color consciousness" and "colorblindness." Examples from the clinical experiences of a white therapist of a multiracial rehabilitation group for heroin addicts illustrates the functions of colorblindness in the group process. Colorblindness was used to establish attractiveness, cohesiveness, a safe retreat, a group norm, to reduce anxiety, and to suppress fear and anger. It is suggested that the effect of the functions of colorblindness on interpersonal and societal relationships should also be examined.

Abstract = {The purpose of this essay is to bring those leading the charge toward integrated churches within two of these families, the Roman Catholic and evangelical, into contact theoretically for the purpose of comparison on the related questions of why and how. Although there are ample quantitative studies on membership and attendance, we have surprisingly little qualitative comparison between these groups. This may be because the gaping differences in polity give the impression that one is comparing apples to oranges. When we look, however, at the ways in which Catholic and evangelical church leaders talk about the need to create unity across cultural and racial lines, they sound remarkably similar. Neither group cites the sociological reasons mentioned above-demographic and attitudinal shifts-as the primary impetus for change. Both Catholic and evangelical church leaders justify their institutional revisioning by invoking biblical mandates for unity and inclusion. Nonetheless, digging beneath the language of unity there are important differences in precisely which theological principles are used to justify turning away from the ethnic church model.

This cross-sectional study examines environmental, psychosocial, and individual correlates of risky sex among 51 MTF ethnic minority transgender youth age 16-25. Fifty-nine percent of participants reported high-risk sex defined as either unprotected insertive or receptive anal intercourse in the past year. Multiple factors that included higher depression scores, lower self-esteem, less social support, poorer safer sex communication skills, being non-African American, use of injection silicone, history of arrest, history of forced sex and having sex while high on drugs/alcohol, were significantly associated with high-risk sex among participants. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that among possible models with two independent variables, poorer communication skills and non-African American race/ethnicity were the most significant predictors of high-risk sex. Future studies examining HIV risk mechanisms in MTF transgender youth are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The goals of this chapter are to examine the exploration of ethnic and racial identity issues beyond adolescence among minority group members. There is wide variation in the extent of ethnic identity exploration during the transition to adulthood, depending on aspects of both the individual and the context. This chapter focuses on ethnic identity exploration in the American context and specifically on ethnic and racial minorities within that context. I consider individual processes and characteristics that influence ethnic identity exploration and the contextual factors that shape the course of such exploration during emerging adulthood. For convenience, I use the term ethnic identity to encompass three aspects of group identity processes: ethnic heritage, racial phenotype, and cultural background. Although these three aspects of group identity can be distinguished conceptually and have different implications for the individual (Alipuria, 2002), they often overlap as individuals strive to construct a coherent sense of self as group members. However, I use separate terms when discussing research that explicitly focuses on one or another aspect. I begin with a summary of the development of ethnic identity before and during adolescence and then examine this process following adolescence in a variety of contexts and for individuals with a range of group identity challenges, such as being bicultural or being biracial.

Based on a retrospective review of 329 patients attending the clinic from 1994 to 1999, the evidence for the validity of the Clinical Dementia Rating's overall ability to stage dementia severity is presented. The Clinical Dementia Rating showed convergent validity when compared against clinical features, mental status, and psychometric test scores, and DSM III-R measures of dementia severity, thus underscoring the trans-cultural feasibility of the Clinical Dementia Rating instrument. The Clinical Dementia Rating is also congruent with the DSM-IV approach of identifying dementia, and demonstrates better discriminatory ability in the milder dementia stages compared with DSM III-R. Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the Clinical Dementia Rating in other social settings, advanced cases, as well as detecting clinically significant change.

Abstract = {Examined levels of concern about online privacy across four demographic groups: sex, education level, income level, and race. Data were obtained from 1998 online Internet surveys conducted at the Graphics, Visualization, and Usability Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 1,223 respondents from the US answered two questionnaires on General Demographics and Online Privacy and Security. Results indicate that there are small differences among degrees of Internet privacy concerns across groups divided by sex, education level, income level, and race, with all groups preferring privacy to convenience. Although the data are limited, results suggest that Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders have the lowest levels of concern with security on the Internet, and Latinos and Hispanics have the highest percentage that is "very concerned." Education level does not seem to affect a person's degree of concern about online privacy, and those with higher income levels seem to be less concerned about privacy than those with lower income levels. Additionally, women seem to have higher concerns about privacy than men have. Overall, all demographic groups prefer privacy protection to convenience.

Abstract = {In this article, the author, a Black trainee therapist/psychologist, explores his counter-transferential feelings in a multi-racial clinical setting. The conceptualization of A. Morrison (1994) regarding the exposure of shame-infused feelings provided the motivation for writing this paper. The author focuses on three incidents that occurred with a 9-year-old male patient, a 'Coloured' adolescent female patient, and a White adolescent female patient, while he was training to become a clinical psychologist in the South African context. Using a self-psychology framework, the author describes how these incidents affected him, and, in particular, his therapeutic intervention with a long-term Black adolescent female patient.

@article{1997-06011-00119970301,
Abstract = {Two contradictory assumptions underlie research on race differences in psychiatric diagnoses: (1) the "clinician bias" (CB) hypothesis, which assumes that Blacks and Whites exhibit symptomatology similarly, but diagnosticians mistakenly judge them differently; and (2) the "cultural relativity" (CR) hypothesis, which assumes that Blacks and Whites have different modes of expressing psychopathology but diagnosticians are unaware of or insensitive to such cultural differences. The purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative test of the CB and CR hypotheses, focusing on paranoid symptoms among 19–59-yr-olds with a recent datable episode of a psychiatric disorder. Race differences are examined on the scales of Distrust (DST), Perceived Hostility of Others (PHO), and False Beliefs and Perceptions (FBP) from the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview (PERI), which measure different types of symptoms ranging from relatively ordinary suspiciousness to more severe paranoia, in relation to diagnoses of depression and schizophrenia-like disorders. In effect, the CB and CR hypotheses become the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively, under conditions where the diagnoses are made according to research criteria. The present findings support the CR over the CB hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Interracial group psychotherapy is workable. Psychodynamics get cathected onto race; as this paper will show, the group process elicits feelings about racial and ethnic differences with greater intensity than in individual therapy. Analysis of race/ethnicity can be both problematic and growth enhancing for treatment. The process of identifying conscious and unconscious feelings and thoughts of race/ethnicity can stimulate major resistance, which can engender difficulties in maintenance of a working alliance. However, the working through of these feelings/thoughts may have a catalytic effect and lead to a more rapid unfolding of core psychodynamic issues. Case material from a multi-racial/multi-ethnic therapy group illustrate these issues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the applicability of the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ) among 299 African American and 338 White 7th and 8th graders. A modified and short form of the instrument was developed by shortening the instrument to 32 items and extending its content to reflect self-perceptions in academic areas of science and social studies. Within both racial groups, the subscales yielded high reliability estimates. However, relationships among the subscales of the instrument varied considerably across racial and gender groups. It was concluded that in multi-racial and/or multicultural applications of the SDQ, comparisons between groups should be done on the components (rather than overall measure) of self construct.

Abstract = {Language is the principal investigative and therapeutic tool in mental health. Both diagnosis and treatment are handicapped if there is no common language between mental health professionals and clients. This book addresses these clinical and management problems that a mental health professional faces in today's multi-racial society and highlights the role played by an interpreter in these situations. It consists of 16 chapters grouped in 2 sections. The first section includes 7 chapters on professional and training issues associated with the work of interpreters. This section highlights the lack of professional identity faced by this group of professionals and emphasizes the need for mental health workers and interpreters to work jointly. The second section has 9 chapters on the various models of clinical practice and it focuses on therapeutic work with interpreters, and the theoretical frameworks that help with developing this practice. It emphasizes the role of the interpreter as an active and important member of the therapeutic interpreter-service user-clinician triad and the importance of accepting the personhood of the interpreter. The editors deserve our appreciation for assembling such an intellectual and stimulating collection appealing to mental health professionals.

The general reliability and validity of General Racism, Anti-Asian, Anti-Black, and Anti-White scales seems well established. Factorial studies of data from 917 adolescents in 39 schools suggest a general link between racism and poor self-esteem, lack of ego-strength, alienation from school and society, and scholastic underachievement in all 3 ethnic groups considered: Whites, Blacks of West Indian origin, and Asians. Various possibilities for reducing the manifestations of prejudiced attitudes are considered. (27 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Four main themes are identified: the anthropological approach, liberal pluralism, cultural pluralism, and the structuralist position. Race relations goals of the anthropological approach are assimilation and integration; of the pluralist approach, integration and social mobility for minorities; of the structural approach, removal of racism through structural change. Relationships among the literature, social work practice, and ultimate race relations goals are discussed. (27 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Whereas whites and Asians showed no major disagreement with the dictionary definition of integration, blacks reported that they did not accept it as a reasonable definition of integration. Implicit in the dictionary definitions of integration is the idea that incorporation or inclusion into the larger society requies that minority persons must give up their own cultural and racial heritage and accept the prevailing or common values of the larger society.
