Abstract = {Many studies show agreement within and between populations and cultures for general judgments of facial attractiveness. Studies that have examined the attractiveness of specific traits have also highlighted cross-cultural differences for factors such as symmetry, averageness, and masculinity. One trait that should be preferred across cultures is heterozygosity. Indeed, several studies suggest that mixed ethnicity, in terms of appearing to possess a mixture of traits from different human population groups, may be found attractive, which could reflect preferences for heterozygosity. We examined preferences for manipulated face shape associated with different populations in both Europeans (Britain) and Africans (Guinea-Bissau). We found that mixed-ethnicity face shapes were more attractive than enhanced single-ethnicity face shape across both populations. These results are consistent with evolutionary theories suggesting individuals should prefer heterozygosity in partners because facial cues to mixed-ethnicity are likely to indicate diverse genes compared to cues that indicate a face belongs to a single particular culture or population.

Abstract = {The number of people with a ‘mixed’ ethnicity heritage is growing in contemporary Britain. Research in this area has largely focused on implications for cultural and racialized identities, and little is known about associated economic and social factors. Data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a representative panel survey of children born in 2000–2001, are used to examine the circumstances of mixed ethnicity children in comparison with their non-mixed and white counterparts. Findings suggest a cultural location between ‘white’ and minority identities, and socio-economic advantage in comparison with non-mixed counterparts. For example, households of non-mixed white children had poorer economic profiles than households of both mixed white and mixed Indian children. This effect is associated with the presence of a white parent, and the factors underlying it are examined. Although the statistical approach used bypasses a consideration of the dynamics of identity, it provides important evidence on stratification and inequality, and the factors driving this.

Abstract = {Purpose: To determine how ethnic background influences early sexual activity among young adults. Methods: Quantitative data were collected during the Research with East London Adolescents Community Health Survey study, a population-based survey of young adults belonging to white and black and minority ethnic groups and residing in east London in 2001 (n = 2,689) and 2003 (n = 2,675). Qualitative data were obtained from 146 young adults between January and September 2003. Results: Black Caribbean, black African, white other, and mixed ethnicity young men were most likely to report high-risk sexual behaviors, that is, sexual debut at the age of ≤13 years, having unprotected sex, and having multiple sexual partners. There were marked variations within groups commonly collapsed as “black” or as “Muslim.” Black Caribbean and black African young adults reported high rates of protective behaviors in addition to risk behaviors. Qualitative data confirmed variations in sexual behavior within ethnic groups. Longitudinally, risk of engaging in two or more high-risk sexual behaviors was predicted by low family support (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.6–4.9), regular smoking (OR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.7–12.0), and usage of illicit drugs (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.5–5.8), with lower risk predicted by low peer support (OR: .3, 95% CI: .2–.6). Conclusions: Young adults belonging to black and minority ethnic groups reported a wide variation in sexual risk behaviors. High levels of high-risk behaviors were reported in ethnic groups known to have high rates of sexually transmitted infections. Effective sexual health interventions should be started early and they must focus on sexual debut and partner choices as well as messages regarding safe sex.

Abstract = {Aims: To explore the role of psychiatric admission, diagnosis and reported unfair treatment in the relationship between ethnicity and mistrust of mental health services. Methods: The Mental Illness-Related Investigations on Discrimination (MIRIAD) study was a cross-sectional study of 202 individuals using secondary mental health services in South London. Two structural equation models were estimated, one using Admission (whether admitted to hospital for psychiatric treatment in the past 5 years) and one using involuntary admission to hospital in the past 5 years. Results: Increased mistrust was directly associated with the latent variable ‘unfair treatment by mental health services and staff’ and with Black or mixed ethnicity in both models. Those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum (as compared to depression and bipolar disorder) had a lower average score on the latent variable, suggesting that on average they reported less unfair treatment. We found evidence of increased reporting of unfair treatment by those who had an admission in the past 5 years, had experienced involuntary admission, and for people of Black of mixed Black and White ethnicity. Conclusions: Neither prevalence of schizophrenia spectrum nor rates of hospital admission explained the greater mistrust of mental health services found among people of Black and mixed Black and White ethnicity compared with White ethnicity. Rather, people of Black and mixed Black and white ethnicity may be more likely to experience unfair treatment, generating mistrust; furthermore, this group is more likely to express mistrust even after accounting for reporting of unfair treatment by mental health services and staff.

Abstract = {Mixed ethnicity children are over-represented in the care system and constitute a significant group of those seeking adoption placements. Social workers are presented with a specific set of concerns in seeking to find adoption placements for mixed ethnicity children as they come from two or more cultural backgrounds. Practitioners face uncertain principles concerning how to respond to these issues, especially in light of social and political pressures, and within the realm of existing debates around ‘transracial’ adoption. There is a danger that among these uncertainties the individuality of the child will be lost as his or her identity needs become viewed narrowly. Social workers may seek to simplify and classify the identities of mixed ethnicity children in the adoption process through pressures that they feel to find ‘matched’ placements. This paper explores how theories concerning identity can provide some insight into the difficulties practitioners face and may help to inform social work practice in this area.

Abstract = {Background: Studies have shown that individuals with intellectual disability (ID) are aware of stigma and are able to describe experiences of being treated negatively. However, there have been no cross‐cultural studies examining whether self‐reported experiences of stigma vary between ethnic groups. Method: Participants with mild and moderate ID were recruited from a number of different settings in Cape Town, South Africa. Self‐reported experiences of stigma in three ethnic groups were measured using the South African version of the Perceived Stigma of Intellectual Disability tool, developed by the authors. One‐way anova was used to test whether there were differences in the total stigma score between the ethnic groups. Regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with stigma. Results: A total of 191 participants agreed to take part; 53 were Black, 70 were of mixed ethnicity and 68 were Caucasian. There were no differences in the levels of stigma reported by the three groups but the Black African ethnic group were more likely to report being physically attacked and being stared at, but were also more likely to report that they thought they were ‘the same as other people’. There was an interaction effect between ethnicity and level of ID, with participants with mild ID from the Black African group reporting higher levels of stigma compared with those with moderate ID. Younger age was the only factor that was associated with stigma but there was a trend towards ethnicity, additional disability and socio‐economic status being related to stigma. Conclusion: Interventions should target the Black African community in South Africa and should include the reduction of both public stigma and self‐reported stigma.

Abstract = {This article analyses gaps in the university graduation rates of third-generation Ashkenazim and Mizrahim (the two major ethnic groups among Israeli Jews), in comparison to the same gaps among members of the second generation. The empirical analyses have been performed using a special file of the 1995 Israeli census which matched records of respondents to their parents in the 1983 Census, thereby allowing identification of the ethnicity of the third generation for a representative sample of men and women, 25-34 years of age in 1995, as well as the identification of persons of mixed ethnicity. The results suggest that the gaps between the two major ethnic groups are not smaller in the third generation than in the second generation. Persons of mixed ethnicity-of both the second and third generations-are located about midway between the two ethnic groups with respect to their university graduation rates. Much of the ethnic-based gap in university graduation is due to differences in family background, especially among women. We discuss the implications of these results for the future of ethnic-based stratification in Israel. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Estimates of around 1.7-2.4% of the population in the USA, 2% in Canada, and 0.6% in Britain now self-identify as mixed race. Inter-ethnic unions comprise around 2.7% of all unions in the USA and 1.3% in Britain and are increasing. The impact of these changes on the ethnic/racial diversity of Britain and North America and the demand from persons of mixed race to describe their 'full' identity requires a response from government and Census agencies that classify the population by race/ethnicity. Research show that the self-understandings of persons of mixed race may incorporate a range of identities, some biracial and others a single group like 'black', although the options available in the USA may still be limited by the legacy of the hypodescent policy. The solutions offered by classifications in the 2000/2001 round of censuses include a subdivided 'mixed' category in England and Wales and provision to select one or more categories in the USA. This marks an end to the official conceptualisation of 'pure' races that has been so pervasive in the past and, for the first time, offers mixed race identity to those of mixed heritage.

Abstract = {This article focuses on the ethnic identity of children in Belize. Belizean nationalism, as taught in the primary schools, is both pan-ethnic and multiethnic. However, because the increasingly widespread practice of ethnic mixing is unacknowledged, there is a discrepancy between what is taught in school and the daily life of children.The overt intent is to recognize and celebrate difference; however, the result has been to silence children's voices. Children, primarily between ages 7 and 11, and teachers were interviewed concerning ethnic identity over 2 school years. Tests, drawings, and papers in which notions of ethnicity were a part were collected. Classes were observed everyday. Teachers reported that 68 out of 230 were of mixed ethnicity. In day-to-day circumstances of school, teachers did not label children by more than 1 ethnic group. 58 out of 68 of the ethnically mixed Ss were interviewed. The results are (1) 10 Ss identified themselves as 2 ethnic groups, (2) 5 Ss said they were mixed without specifying an ethnic group, (3) 39 Ss chose a single ethnic label, and (4) 4 remaining Ss said "I don't know." No clear pattern emerged that could predict what ethnic identity a child of mixed ethnicity would choose. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Many claims are made about the significance of interethnic partnerships for individuals and for society. Such partnerships continue to be seen as a “barometer” of the openness of society and have spawned extensive analysis investigating their patterns, trends, and determinants. But we know little about the experience of children growing up in families of mixed parentage. In the United Kingdom, the increase in the self-defined “mixed” population is often celebrated. But there has been little quantitative sociological analysis that has investigated the circumstances of the children of mixed ethnicity partnerships. Using two large-scale UK datasets that cover a similar period, this article evaluates the extent to which mixed parentage families are associated with circumstances (both economic and in terms of family structure) that tend to be positive or negative for children’s future life chances and how these compare to those of children with parents from the same ethnic group. It shows that there is substantial variation according to the outcome considered but also according to ethnic group. Overall, children in mixed parent-age families do not unequivocally experience the equality of outcomes with majority group children that the assimilation hypothesis implies.

Abstract = {Context: Despite calls to make family planning services more responsive to the values, needs and preferences of clients, few studies have asked clients about their experiences or values, and most have used surveys framed by researchers', rather than clients', perspectives. Methods: Forty in-depth interviews exploring lifetime experiences with and values regarding services were conducted with 18–36-year-old women who visited family planning clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2007. Women were categorized as black, white, English- or Spanish-speaking Latina, or of mixed ethnicity to allow examination of differences by racial, ethnic and language group. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and coded thematically; matrices were then used to compare the themes that emerged across the subgroups. Results: Eight themes emerged as important to women's views of services: service accessibility, information provision, attention to client comfort, providers' personalization of care, service organization, providers' empathy, technical quality of care and providers' respect for women's autonomy. Women reported that it was important to feel comfortable during visits, to feel that their decision-making autonomy was respected, to have providers show empathy and be nonjudgmental, and to see the same provider across visits. The only notable difference among racial, ethnic and language groups was that Spanish-speaking Latinas wanted to receive language-appropriate care and contraceptive information. Conclusions: Future surveys of family planning service quality should include measures of the factors that women value in such care, and efforts to improve providers' communication and counseling skills should emphasize the personalization of services and respect for clients' autonomy.

Abstract = {Adolescents from areas of high deprivation are often assumed to have low aspirations for the future. However, recent research has suggested otherwise and there have been calls for more substantial investigation into the relationship between poverty and aspiration. This article reports levels and variation in aspiration from 1214 adolescents (49.5 % male; 50.5 % female) living in areas of high deprivation across 20 London boroughs. A strength of this study is our large and diverse population of low socio-economic status (SES) adolescents, comprising of white British (22 %), black African (21 %), black Caribbean (9 %), Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi/Other Asian (24 %), mixed ethnicity (9 %), and 15 % defining themselves as Other. Our measures indicated a high group level of reported aspiration with notable variations. Females reported higher educational (but not occupational) aspirations than males; white British students reported lower educational and occupational aspirations than other ethnic groups; and black African children reported the highest educational aspirations. Perceived parental support for education had the largest positive association with aspirations. In contrast to previous findings from studies carried out in the United States, aspirations were found to be negatively associated with perceptions of school and school peer environment. These measures explored feelings of safety, happiness and belonging within the school environment and school peer group. We discuss possible explanations for this unexpected finding within our population of adolescents from UK state schools and how it might affect future policy interventions. This study makes an important contribution to the literature on adolescent aspirations because of the unique nature of the data sample and the multiple domains of functioning and aspiration measured.

The present study investigated whether the under-attainment of ethnic minority students might be due to the nature of the feedback that they received for their assignments. The assignments submitted by 470 ethnic minority and 470 matched white students taking a distance-learning course were compared using a computer system, Open Mentor, to categorise the feedback given by tutors based on a scheme devised by Bales. Asian and black students and students of mixed ethnicity obtained lower marks for their assignments than did the white students. However, there were only small differences between the ethnic minority students and the white students in terms of the pattern of feedback that they received, and these disappeared when the marks that they had received for their assignments had been taken into account. It is concluded that students from all ethnic groups received feedback that was commensurate with their marks, and that the origins of the attainment gap in ethnic minority students in UK higher education must be sought elsewhere.

Abstract = {The MMPI-2 is widely used in assessments of police officer candidates. The MMPI-2-RF, composed of 338 of the 567 MMPI-2 items, is designed to measure the core clinical constructs assessed by the MMPI-2, but in a more psychometrically sound and efficient manner (Ben-Porath and Tellegen 2008/2011). Law enforcement comparison group data are embedded in the scoring software for the inventory, and reported in the User’s Guide for the MMPI-2-RF Police Candidate Interpretive Report (PCIR; Corey and Ben-Porath 2014). In the present concurrent validity study, conceptually based hypotheses regarding associations between MMPI-2-RF scales and scores on the Inwald Personality Inventory (IPI, Inwald et al. 1982; Hilson Research 2006), a test specifically designed to screen law enforcement officers, were tested with a sample of 277 male, full-time police officer candidates from four separate police departments of varying sizes examined after a conditional offer of employment was tendered. The majority of participants were Caucasian (69%), followed by African-American (27%), or Other/Mixed ethnicity (4%). Our hypotheses were largely borne out, lending support to the construct validity of the MMPI-2-RF and the ability of scores on the inventory to assess variables relevant to police candidate evaluations.

Abstract = {Introduction: The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) involves both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, with focus on the mutationin the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA). Objective: To analyse the polymorphism SNCA-A53T in patients with familial PD (FPD) and sporadic PD (SPD). Method: A total of 294 individuals were studied, regardless of sex and with mixed ethnicity. The study group with 154 patients with PD, and the control group included 140 individuals without PD. The genotyping of SNCA-A53T was performed by PCR/RFLP. Significance level was p < 0.05. Results: Among all patients, 37 (24%) had FPD and 117 (75.9%) had SPD. The absence of SNCA-A53T mutation was observed in all individuals. Conclusion: SPD is notably observed in patients. However, the SNCA-A53T mutation was absent in all individuals, which does not differ controls from patients. This fact should be confirmed in a Brazilian study case with a more numerous and older population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We sought to examine the fluidity of ethnic identification and test shared reality’s hypothesis concerning the effects of interpersonal relationships on ethnic identification. To investigate the effects of ethnicity of spouse on ethnic identification, Asian-American women (66 from same-ethnicity marriages, 46 from mixed-ethnicity marriages) completed several measures of ethnic identification after thinking about positive aspects of their relationship with either their spouse or their mother. Women in same-ethnicity marriages reported equivalent levels of ethnic identification whether they thought about their mother or their spouse. Women in mixed-ethnicity marriages reported lower ethnic identification when they thought about their different-ethnicity spouse; but when thinking about their mother, they reported high ethnic identification equivalent to the levels reported by women in same-ethnicity marriages. Mediational analyses revealed that, consistent with shared reality theory, shared understanding of one’s ethnic identity with one’s spouse partially mediated the relationship between same- and different-ethnicity spouses and ethnic identification. Implications for theories of ethnic identity and for individuals in mixed-ethnicity romantic relationships are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Introduction: We assessed the prevalence and frequency of waterpipe smoking among adults (aged 18+ years) in Great Britain (GB) and determined demographic factors associated with use. Methods: We used cross-sectional representative population surveys conducted online in 2012 and 2013. A total of 12,436 adults in 2012 and 12,171 in 2013 were recruited from a commercial online survey panel. Results: The prevalence of ever use of waterpipe across both survey years combined was 11.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0–12.1). Frequent use (at least once or twice a month) was 1.0% (95% CI = 0.8–1.2) and was similar in both 2012 and 2013. There was some suggestion of increased ever but not frequent use among 18–24-year-olds between survey years. After adjustment for covariates, females had lower odds of ever waterpipe use than males (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.63–0.79), those in the lowest social grade had lower odds of use compared to those in the highest social grade (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.35–0.54), older people were at much lower odds of ever use than younger people, ever having smoked cigarettes increased odds of ever waterpipe use, and being Asian (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.39–2.45) or of mixed ethnicity (OR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.64–3.40) increased likelihood of ever use compared to White ethnicity. Conclusions: Frequent waterpipe smoking was relatively rare in these representative samples of the GB adult population, and prevalence was similar between 2012 and 2013. Continued monitoring and targeted interventions are appropriate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The current study investigated: (a) the relationships of exposure to the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) with reductions in substance use, illegal activity, and juvenile justice system involvement in adolescents diagnosed with a substance use disorder, and (b) the pathways by which reductions in the target behaviors were achieved. This study is a secondary data analysis of longitudinal data from a large-scale implementation effort for A-CRA. The sample consisted of 1,467 adolescents who presented to substance use treatment and reported past-year engagement in illegal activity. Participants had an average age of 15.8 years (SD = 1.3) and were 25% female, 14% African American, 29% Hispanic, 35% Caucasian, 16% mixed ethnicity, and 6% other ethnicity. Path analyses provided support that participation in A-CRA had a significant, direct association with reduced substance use; a significant, indirect association with reduced illegal activity through reductions in substance use; and a significant indirect association with reduced juvenile justice system involvement through reductions in both substance use and illegal activity. In addition, post hoc analyses using a bootstrapping strategy provided evidence that reductions in substance use partially mediated the relationship between A-CRA and illegal activity.

Abstract = {Ethnic identity was conceptualized into three categories: (1) unexamined, (2) searching for identity, and (3) achieved ethnic identity. Analyses of data collected from 12,386 adolescents showed that ethnic identity is an important qualifier of the relationships between independent variables of ethnicity and gender, and dependent variables of global self-esteem, academic self-confidence, and purpose in life. Whites and Native Americans had lower ethnic identity, and Blacks and Hispanics had higher ethnic identity. Asians and respondents of mixed ethnicity had intermediate levels of ethnic identity. The greater the ethnic identity, the higher the self-esteem, purpose in life and self confidence. This mechanism applies to ethnic minorities and to women among whom achieved ethnic identity may blunt the negative effects of social denigration and stereotyping, and it applies to whites, too. The paper argues that multiculturalism in the schools can increase ethnic identity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Participants (N = 2,134; age at baseline: M = 15.0, SD = 1.6 years) provided two waves of survey data. A six-step hierarchical linear regression analysis examined the predictive contribution of Time 1 BD, weight status, demographics, family and peer environmental factors, and psychological factors. Among females, Asian race/ethnicity, low self-esteem, greater BD, and higher body mass index (BMI) during adolescence contributed significantly to predicting greater BD at 10-year follow up (R² = .27). Among males, demographics (i.e., Asian, other-mixed ethnicity, education attainment), depressive symptoms, greater BD, higher BMI, more parent communication, and less peer weight teasing during adolescence contributed to BD at follow-up (R² = .27). Findings indicate who may be at greatest risk of BD in young adulthood and the types of factors that should be addressed during adolescence.

Abstract = {Studies on stylised language use have tended to focus on the creative exploitation of linguistic heteroglossia among urban multi-ethnic youth. This article argues that there are good reasons for exploring how such practices can also be initiated by norm-enforcing white adults such as teachers. I report on linguistic ethnographic fieldwork in one mixed-ethnicity class at a Brussels Dutch-medium school and describe how one teacher often produced the creative, stylised language use one usually associates with younger speakers. The analysis emphasizes that while teacher stylisations provided alleviation from the friction between linguistic expectations and the reality of the classroom floor, they were also functional in maintaining the school linguistic policy inasmuch as they typified nonstylised, nonaccented, and standard language use as normal and expected. These findings suggest that stylisations can be closely tuned to linguistic normativity and reproductive of wider patterns of sociolinguistic stratification.

Abstract = {Background: In the UK, there has been growing concern about the incidence and prognosis of psychosis in minority ethnic groups for a number of years. Negative self‐appraisals after first‐episode psychosis (FEP) are associated with post‐psychotic depression, poor functioning and suicidality. In carers, appraisals of loss and decreased control are linked with high expressed emotion and relapse; however, as yet there has been no investigation as to how ethnicity and culture relate to these negative appraisals in FEP. Aims: The study aims to investigate the occurrence of negative illness appraisals, for example, loss and shame, in FEP within different ethnic and social‐cultural groups. In addition, it aims to explore influence of insight, recovery style and carers’ appraisals in the development of negative appraisals. Methods: There were 67 patients and 46 carers who completed reliable and valid measures on beliefs about illness, insight and recovery style. Data on ethnicity and deprivation were also collected. Results: Black patients experienced significantly less loss, lack of control and entrapment than White, Asian and mixed ethnicity patients, yet these were not explained by lower levels of insight or recovery style. Patient's and carer's appraisals were highly correlated. Conclusion: Black patients, in spite of higher incidence and poorer outcome in FEP, experienced less loss and shame. Possible explanations, including a protective aspect of alternative health belief models, are explored. This area provides much scope for further investigation. Strong relationships between patient and carer appraisals indicate that family interventions are essential to improved clinical outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background/Study Context: The current study examined the relationship between intellectual control and cognition and related the results to everyday problem solving in a mixed ethnicity sample of 35% African American and 65% Caucasian elders. Methods: Participants completed the Personality in Intellectual Aging Contexts Inventory (PIC; Lachman et al., 1982, Journal of Research in Personality, 16, 485–501), Everyday Cognition Battery (ECB; Allaire & Marsiske, 1999, Psychology & Aging, 14, 627–644; 2002, Psychology & Aging, 17, 101–115), and a battery of basic cognitive ability tests assessing memory, inductive reasoning, and verbal meaning. Results: Results indicated that African Americans had significantly lower intellectual control beliefs relative to Caucasian older adults. Regression models suggested that relationship between control beliefs and cognition was moderated by education and race. Decomposing the interactions with simple slope analysis revealed that across cognitive abilities, better cognitive performance was related to higher control beliefs in African Americans with at least 13 years of education. A similar relationship was also found in Caucasian elders with lower education. Conclusion: African American elders’ reaching a higher level of education may provide a basis for which individual differences in intellectual control beliefs are activated and thereby more strongly associated with cognitive performance.

Abstract = {Background: The unfair treatment of individuals with severe mental illness has been linked to poorer physical and mental health outcomes. Additionally, anticipation of discrimination may lead some individuals to avoid participation in particular life areas, leading to greater isolation and social marginalisation. This study aimed to establish the levels and clinical and socio-demographic associations of anticipated and experienced discrimination amongst those diagnosed with a schizophrenia and comparator severe mental illnesses (bipolar and major depressive disorders). Methods: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of anticipated and experienced discrimination from 202 individuals in South London (47% with schizophrenia, 32% with depression and 20% with bipolar disorder). Results: 93% of the sample anticipated discrimination and 87% of participants had experienced discrimination in at least one area of life in the previous year. There was a significant association between the anticipation and the experience of discrimination. Higher levels of experienced discrimination were reported by those of a mixed ethnicity, and those with higher levels of education. Women anticipated more discrimination than men. Neither diagnosis nor levels of functioning were associated with the extent of discrimination. Clinical symptoms of anxiety, depression and suspiciousness were associated with more experienced and anticipated discrimination respectively. Conclusions: The unfair treatment of individuals with severe mental illnesses remains unacceptably common. Population level interventions are needed to reduce levels of discrimination and to safeguard individuals. Interventions are also required to assist those with severe mental illness to reduce internalised stigma and social avoidance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: This study examined ethnic disparities in antipsychotic therapy in a population with significant Asian representation. Methods: Using a cross-sectional retrospective study design, self-reported ethnicity data pooled from three cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey were linked to 2005 administrative data on physician, hospital, and pharmaceutical use in British Columbia, Canada. Logistic regression was used to model the association between ethnicity and the likelihood of filling one or more prescriptions for any antipsychotic, with controls for sex, age, residence, immigrant status, income, health status, and diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and dementia. Results: Of the 27,658 individuals in the sample, 2.2% filled at least one antipsychotic prescription. The proportion varied across ethnic groups: Chinese, 1.0%; other Asians, 1.2%; whites, 2.3%; nonwhite non-Asians, 2.8%; and mixed ethnicity, 4.3%. After adjustment for patient characteristics and diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the likelihood of filling a prescription was found to be lower among Chinese (odds ratio [OR] = .47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .24–.90) and higher among persons of mixed ethnicity (OR = 3.19, CI = 1.49–6.83). Further adjustment for depression and dementia diagnoses did not significantly change the ORs for the Chinese (OR = .49, CI = .25–.98) and the mixed ethnic groups (OR = 2.97, CI = 1.30–6.80). Conclusions: Consistent with the existing literature on ethnic disparities in antipsychotic therapy, the study found evidence of persistent disparities in a population that has a significant number of Asians. Further studies should be done to identify possible causes of these disparities and to identify potential interventions that may reduce or eliminate them.

Abstract = {Background: Circumcision is efficacious in reducing HIV acquisition in heterosexual males. The South Africa government has been reluctant to adopt a national circumcision programme, possibly due to concerns that circumcision may result in decreased condom use. Objective: To identify the determinants of demand for male circumcision, to examine variations by ethnicity, and to determine whether it is demanded to avoid condom use. Methods: 403 parents and 237 sons in Johannesburg, South Africa, were recruited through a randomized household survey, with oversampling to balance between blacks (n = 220), ‘coloured’ (mixed ethnicity) (n = 202) and whites (n = 218). The demand for male circumcision was estimated using a conjoint analysis, with each respondent randomly receiving four tasks comparing seven possible benefits—six identified through key informant interviews and one for condom avoidance. Respondents’ choices were analysed using logistic regression, including stratified analyses to test for homogeneity. Results: Overall, circumcision’s beneficial effects on HIV transmission (P < 0.001), sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission (P < 0.001), hygiene (P < 0.05) and sex (P < 0.05) were identified as determinants of demand, but the condom avoidance hypothesis was rejected as it was ‘repulsive’ to respondents (P < 0.001). Consistent results were found for blacks (P < 0.001) and coloured (P < 0.001), but not for whites who found condom avoidance attractive (P < 0.04), a result not explained by variations in wealth, age or paternal circumcision status. Conclusions: Male circumcision programmes should be tailored to accommodate variations in the determinants of demand across the target population. We find that circumcision’s protective effect against HIV acquisition in men is the only determinant to be found consistently across all ethnic groups in Johannesburg. We also find that concerns over condom avoidance may have been overstated. This said, male circumcision strategies should reinforce a range of HIV prevention strategies, including condom use, as we find evidence that whites may view circumcision as a means to avoid condom use.

Abstract = {Tai chi (TC) has been shown to positively influence health-related fitness (HRF) of elderly participants by affording them a means to increase musculoskeletal strength. The objective of this study was to examine TC intervention effects on HRF and whether ethnic groups not culturally related to TC experienced a barrier to participation in a community-based program for low-income older adults. Seventy-eight older mixed-ethnicity adults (age 55 and older) who were not culturally affiliated with TC were recruited for this study. HRF measures were taken before and after a 16-week TC program that offered seven sessions per week. Significant improvements were found in upper and lower musculoskeletal fitness and partial curl-ups, with TC being embraced by the participants. These results suggest that TC can be effective for improving HRF and that non-TC culturally related ethnic groups did not experience a barrier to participation in an older low-socioeconomic population sample.

Abstract = {This study examined exposure to violence and risk for lethality in intimate partner relationships as factors related to co-occurring MH problems and use of mental health (MH) resources among women of African descent. Black women with intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences (n = 431) were recruited from primary care, prenatal or family planning clinics in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Severity of IPV was significantly associated with co-occurring MH problems, but was not associated with the use of MH resources among African-American women. Risk for lethality and co-occurring problems were also not significantly related to the use of resources. African Caribbean women with severe physical abuse experiences were significantly less likely to use resources. In contrast, severity of physical abuse was positively associated with the use of resources among Black women with mixed ethnicity. Severe IPV experiences are risk factors for co-occurring MH problems, which in turn, increases the need for MH services. However, Black women may not seek help for MH problems. Thus, social work practitioners in health care settings must thoroughly assess women for their IPV experiences and develop tailored treatment plans that address their abuse histories and MH needs.

Abstract = {To the extent that stereotype and identity threat undermine academic performance, social psychological interventions that lessen threat could buffer threatened students and improve performance. Two studies, each featuring a longitudinal field experiment in a mixed-ethnicity middle school, examined whether a values affirmation writing exercise could attenuate the achievement gap between Latino American and European American students. In Study 1, students completed multiple self-affirmation (or control) activities as part of their regular class assignments. Latino American students, the identity threatened group, earned higher grades in the affirmation than control condition, whereas White students were unaffected. The effects persisted 3 years and, for many students, continued into high school by lifting their performance trajectory. Study 2 featured daily diaries to examine how the affirmation affected psychology under identity threat, with the expectation that it would shape students' narratives of their ongoing academic experience. By conferring a big-picture focus, affirmation was expected to broaden construals, prevent daily adversity from being experienced as identity threat, and insulate academic motivation from identity threat. Indeed, affirmed Latino American students not only earned higher grades than nonaffirmed Latino American students but also construed events at a more abstract than concrete level and were less likely to have their daily feelings of academic fit and motivation undermined by identity threat. Discussion centers on how social-psychological processes propagate themselves over time and how timely interventions targeting these processes can promote well-being and achievement.

Abstract = {Method: This cross-sectional observational study was performed in 2007 by convenience sampling of 1031 full-time undergraduate students registered in years 1, 2 and 3 in the academic year 2007/2008, administering a basic demographics questionnaire along with the standardised General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) to each participant. Results: The population of full-time students at the University of the West Indies (UWI) was found to be mentally healthy (median GHQ score was 5.00; GHQ = 6 considered “mentally unhealthy”). However, median GHQ scores were lowest (4.00) in the Faculties of Medical Sciences and Social Sciences, but highest (6.00) in the Faculty of Humanities and Education. Furthermore, analysis showed that females were less mentally healthy than males attending the UWI. With regard to ethnicity, the African group was the most mentally healthy group whereas the group of mixed ethnicity was the least. Religion was also shown to significantly affect the GHQ (4.00 for Christians and Hindus, 6.00 for Muslims and 8.00 for those categorized as ‘other’). Most interesting was the relationship of GHQ scores with the manner in which participants related to their lecturers, classmates, guardians, siblings and friends; it was found that the better one related to these people, the lower one’s GHQ score was and hence one was considered more mentally healthy. Conclusions: UWI full-time undergraduate students are mentally healthy, but gender, ethnicity, religion, quality of relationships and faculty of study still contribute to significant differences within the population. This allows high-risk individuals to be identified and indicates where steps can be taken to improve mental health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Cellular phones provide a means for parents to monitor and request information about whereabouts, associates, and current activities from adolescents. Simultaneously, adolescents can communicate with parents to inform them of activities and to solicit support or they can also choose to nondisclose. The frequency, duration, and nature of calls may relate to parents’ and to adolescents’ perceptions of truthfulness and family relationships. 196 dyads (13% father–son, 11% father–daughter, 30% mother– son, and 46% mother–daughter) completed a questionnaire indicating cell phone use, their truthfulness of activities, the nature of their calls to one another, and family relationships. The parents were, on average, 45.38 years old (SD = 6.35) and were 83% Euroamerican, 9% Asian American, 3% Latino, 3% African American, 2% Mixed ethnicity, and 1% American Indian. The adolescents were, on average, 16.25 years old (SD = 1.17) and were 77% Euroamerican, 9% Asian American, 4% Latino, 3% African American, 8% Mixed ethnicity, and .5% American Indian. Correlational analyses revealed that parents who called more frequently reported less truthfulness when speaking to their adolescents via cell phone. Greater frequency in parental calls also was associated with less adolescent-reported truthfulness. From multiple regression analyses, for parents, calls when upset were associated with less parental knowledge and poorer family relations. For adolescents, the same was true; however, adolescents who made calls seeking social support and to ask and confer with parents reported greater perceived parental knowledge and better family relationships.

Abstract = {Objectives: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia with spinal muscular atrophy, also known as PCH1, is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by generalized muscle weakness and global developmental delay commonly resulting in early death. Gene defects had been discovered only in single patients until the recent identification of EXOSC3 mutations in several families with relatively mild course of PCH1.We aim to genetically stratify subjects in a large and well-defined cohort to define the clinical spectrum and genotype–phenotype correlation. Methods: We documented clinical, neuroimaging, and morphologic data of 37 subjects from 27 families with PCH1. EXOSC3 gene sequencing was performed in 27 unrelated index patients of mixed ethnicity. Results: Biallelic mutations in EXOSC3 were detected in 10 of 27 families (37%). The most common mutation among all ethnic groups was c.395A>C, p.D132A, responsible for 11 (55%) of the 20 mutated alleles and ancestral in origin. The mutation-positive subjects typically presented with normal pregnancy, normal birth measurements, and relative preservation of brainstem and cortical structures. Psychomotor retardation was profound in all patients but lifespan was variable, with 3 subjects surviving beyond the late teens. Abnormal oculomotor function was commonly observed in patients surviving beyond the first year. Major clinical features previously reported in PCH1, including intrauterine abnormalities, postnatal hypoventilation and feeding difficulties, joint contractures, and neonatal death,were rarely observed in mutation-positive infants but were typical among the mutation-negative subjects. Conclusion: EXOSC3 mutations account for 30%–40% of patients with PCH1 with variability in survival and clinical severity that is correlated with the genotype.

Abstract = {Objective: This study evaluated the ability of delinquent peer affiliation to mediate the effects of multidimensional treatment foster care (MTFC; Chamberlain, 2003) on girls' delinquent behavior. Method: This study used a sample of girls from 2 cohorts (N = 166; M = 15.31 years old at baseline, range 13–17 years; 74% European American, 2% African American, 7% Hispanic, 4% Native American, 1% Asian, and 13% mixed ethnicity) and measures of delinquent behavior, including general delinquency, number of criminal referrals, and number of days in locked settings. As the mediator, we used self-reports of affiliation with delinquent peers. Our analytic plan specified an intent-to-treat analysis within the framework of a randomized controlled trial comparing MTFC with traditional community-based group care. Results: Random assignment to the MTFC program reduced girls' number of criminal referrals and number of days in locked settings at 24 months. The MTFC condition also reduced girls' exposure to delinquent peers at 12 months, which in turn reduced levels of all forms of delinquent behavior at 24 months; indirect effects were statistically significant. Conclusions: Reduction in exposure to delinquent peers mediated MTFC effects on the number of criminal referrals and number of days in locked settings; delinquent peers also served as an intervening variable between MTFC and self-report delinquency, suggesting that, by reducing contact with delinquent peers, MTFC helped to encourage lower levels of self-report delinquency. Existing prevention and intervention programs targeting similar populations may benefit from increased attention to reductions in delinquent peer affiliation in female samples.

Abstract = {Explored differences in the self-reported drug use and exposure to drugs of an ethnically diverse group of 408 7th-grade students from a large city in the southwest. The authors contrast the explanatory power of ethnic labels (African American, non-Hispanic White, Mexican American, and mixed ethnicity) and 2 dimensions of ethnic identity in predicting drug use. One dimension focuses on perceived ethnically consistent behavior, speech, and looks, while the other gauges a sense of ethnic pride. Ethnic labels were found to be somewhat useful in identifying differences in drug use. In conjunction, ethnic labels and ethnic entity measures explained far more of the differences in drug use than either did alone. The 2 dimensions of ethnic identity predicted drug outcomes in opposite ways, and these relations were different for minority students and non-Hispanic White students. Generally, African American, Mexican American, and mixed-ethnicity students with a strong sense of ethnic pride reported less drug use and exposure, while ethnically proud White students reported more. Ethnic minority students who viewed their behavior, speech, and looks as consistent with their ethnic group reported more drug use and exposure, while their White counterparts reported less.

Abstract = {Background: Using data from a study of reliability and validity of a screening tool for co-occurring substance abuse and mental health problems, our objective was to compare behavioral health issues of female smokers and nonsmokers and explore correlates of smoking. Methods: Using a convenience sample (n = 1021), we recruited participants to complete an online survey conducted in substance abuse treatment, primary care, mental health services, senior, and public settings. The survey included demographic questions, smoking status, the co-occurring disorders screening tool, the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener (GAIN-SS) and the Postraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)- Civilian. Results: One third of participants self-identified as smokers, and African American, American Indian, and bisexual women reported the highest rates of smoking. Seventy-two percent of women reported at least one mental health problem in the past year; 29% had a past year substance abuse problem, and 26% reported a past year co-occurring disorder of both. Smokers had significantly higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), past year depression and anxiety, suicidality, past year substance abuse, and co-occurring disorders. Smokers also had significantly higher rates of lifetime intimate partner violence (IPV) and childhood abuse. Conclusions: Smoking in women was associated with significantly higher rates of mental health and substance abuse problems. Substance abuse, being in a treatment setting, IPV, African American and mixed ethnicity, Medicaid insurance status, reduced income, and no home ownership were identified as predictors of smoking. Screening and evaluation of smoking status, mental health, substance use disorders, and the presence and impact of violence are essential for women’s health.

Abstract = {This chapter provides a broad overview of the history of psychology in Brazil from the first notions of psychological though in the country's colonial period through the inception of scientific psychology in the late 19th and early 20th century, up to the consolidation of psychology as profession and scientific practice throughout the 20th century. Psychological ideas first arrived in Brazil through Jesuit clericals, who were in charge of the colony's education from the 16th century to the middle of 18th century, when they were banned from the Portuguese Kingdom. Children of Native, European, and mixed ethnicity were in the same classes, and Jesuits assimilated the ideas of Native Brazilians about child development and education into their own propositions. Higher education was prohibited in the Portuguese colonies up to the 19th century. Brazilian nationals interested in pursuing academic degrees in law or medicine had to do so in Portugal or France, up to 1808, when the country's first two Medical Schools were created. Throughout these schools, new European ideas about psychology arrived in Brazil. The school in Rio de Janeiro was more concerned about neuropsychiatry, psychophysiology, and neurology. In Salvador, the medical school focused on the study of criminology, forensic psychiatry, mental hygiene, social psychology, and pedagogy. In the early 20th century, psychological laboratories were first established in normal schools (aimed at training teachers for child education) and mental hospitals. Laboratories were implemented by Brazilian students of European and American psychologists, or by the foreign scholars themselves. They visited the country by official invitation, and some eventually settled here. Psychology was recognized as a profession in Brazil by a federal law in 1962. By that time, training and research in psychology were organized around major theoretical approaches, mainly psychoanalysis. It is argued that the current trend of psychology in Brazil is toward growing specialization and consolidation of its subdisciplines, reflected on a growing number of scientific societies and specialized periodicals.

Abstract = {Collaborative approaches such as Problem Based Learning (PBL) may provide the opportunity to bring together diverse students but their efficacy in practice and the complications that arise due to the mixed ethnicity needs further investigation. This study explores the key advantages and problems of heterogeneous PBL groups from the students’ and teachers’ opinions. Focus groups were conducted with a stratified sample of second year medical students and their PBL teachers. We found that students working in heterogeneous groupings interact with students with whom they don’t normally interact with, learn a lot more from each other because of their differences in language and academic preparedness and become better prepared for their future professions in multicultural societies. On the other hand we found students segregating in the tutorials along racial lines and that status factors disempowered students and subsequently their productivity. Among the challenges was also that academic and language diversity hindered student learning. In light of these the recommendations were that teachers need special diversity training to deal with heterogeneous groups and the tensions that arise. Attention should be given to create ‘the right mix’ for group learning in diverse student populations. The findings demonstrate that collaborative heterogeneous learning has two sides that need to be balanced. On the positive end we have the ‘ideology’ behind mixing diverse students and on the negative the ‘practice’ behind mixing students. More research is needed to explore these variations and their efficacy in more detail. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

A survey identifying the range of learning activities taking place in and around the home is reported and extracts from case study material from nine families obtained through interviews, video-recording and scrapbooks are explored in terms of the patterns of interaction, the kinds of knowledge exchanged and the discursive opportunities opened up in this process. The findings are interpreted in relation to sociocultural theory where the understandings and skills held by both adults and children can be regarded as contributing to learning as a joint enterprise. The relevance of the exchanges is considered in relation to the shifts between the discursive spaces in which language learning occurs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: In a randomized clinical trial with 111 families of parents with a history of major depressive disorder (86% mothers, 14% fathers; 86% Caucasian, 5% African-American, 3% Hispanic, 1% American Indian or Alaska Native, 4% mixed ethnicity), changes in adolescents' (mean age = 11 years; 42% female, 58% male) coping and parents' parenting skills were examined as mediators of the effects of a family group cognitive–behavioral preventive intervention on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Method: Changes in hypothesized mediators were assessed at 6 months, and changes in adolescents' symptoms were measured at a 12-month follow-up. Results: Significant differences favoring the family intervention compared with a written information comparison condition were found for changes in composite measures of parent–adolescent reports of adolescents' use of secondary control coping skills and direct observations of parents' positive parenting skills. Changes in adolescents' secondary control coping and positive parenting mediated the effects of the intervention on depressive, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms, accounting for approximately half of the effect of the intervention on the outcomes. Further, reciprocal relations between children's internalizing symptoms and parenting were found from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: The present study provides the first evidence for specific mediators of a family group cognitive–behavioral preventive intervention for families of parents with a history of major depressive disorder. The identification of both coping and parenting as mediators of children's mental health outcomes suggests that these variables are important active ingredients in the prevention of mental health problems in children of depressed parents.

Abstract = {Examined racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) across the US. Face-to-face interviews were conducted among 2612 randomly selected Ss (aged 15-25) from 13 cities in venues identified with large samples of ethnic minority YMSM. The 13 sites were divided into 4 ethnic strata, within which only YMSM of 1 of the following ethnic backgrounds were recruited: African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and mixed ethnicity. Results show that 22% of Ss reported that their last sexual contact with their main sexual partner, someone other than a main sexual partner, or both involved unprotected anal intercourse. Ss from Asian/Pacific Islander sites, mixed sites, and Hispanic sites were more likely than Ss from African American sites to report unprotected anal intercourse. Within the mixed sites, Hispanic Ss, followed by Asian/Pacific Islander and White Ss, were more likely than African American Ss to report unprotected anal intercourse. It is concluded that interventions are needed that are responsive to the racial/ethnic differences in HIV risk behaviors of YMSM throughout urban American cities.

Abstract = {While few studies have identified predictors of exiting homelessness among adults, even fewer studies have attempted to identify these predictors among homeless youth. The current study explored predictors of change in homelessness among 180 homeless youth between the ages of 14 and 22, recruited through an urban drop-in center. All youth were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The sample included 118 males and the reported ethnicity included Latino (n = 54), Anglo (n = 73), Native American (n = 24), African American (n = 6) and mixed ethnicity or "other" (n = 23). Four distinct patterns of change in homelessness were identified among youth which included those who (1) had fairly low rates of homelessness at each follow-up point, (2) started in the mid-range of homelessness, increased at 3 months and sharply declined at 6-months (MHL), (3) reported high rates of homelessness at baseline and low rates at each follow-up point (HLL), and finally, (4) remained consistently homeless across time (HMH). These patterns of change were most strongly predicted by social connections and engagement in HIV risk behaviors. The findings from this study suggest that developing trust and linkages between homeless youth and service providers may be a more powerful immediate target of intervention than targeting child abuse issues, substance use and mental health problems.

Abstract = {Background: Jackson, Michigan, is a medium-sized city suffering from a bad economy and obesity-related health issues. Nearly 20% of the 36,000 residents live below the poverty line. It is a relatively young city (median age of 30 years) with a mixed ethnicity (20% black, 73% white, 4% Hispanic). The city offers many structured, active recreational opportunities, but has not integrated physical activity into daily life. Intervention: Project U-Turn aimed to increase active transportation (e.g., biking, walking, and transit use) through an integrated approach to Active Living by Design's community action model and the Michigan Safe Routes to School model. Resources were focused on active living promotions and programs; partnership meetings were the source of changes in policy and physical projects. Each initiative was designed to introduce each of the 5Ps (preparation, promotion, programs, policy, and physical projects) to build support for the partnership's overall work. Results: The partnership collected snapshot data of community walking and biking behavior, percentage of students walking to school, participation in events and programs, and new physical projects. Jackson saw a vast improvement in physical infrastructure and policy and a related increase in walking and biking in the community. Lessons learned: The project engaged in purposeful partnership building to implement effective programs and promotions that built support for policy and physical projects. Limited resources were best used by encouraging partners to contribute and coordinate activities using existing staff, funding, and resources. Conclusions: Jackson has seen a shift toward awareness of the benefits of active living on community health, economic development, and environmental awareness.

Abstract = {There is now considerable evidence that witnessing domestic violence can have adverse consequences for children. Our aim is to present the socio-demographic correlates of children witnessing domestic violence and its association with childhood mental disorders. The biographic, socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics of 7865 children and their families and measures of traumatic events including witnessing domestic violence were entered into a logistic regression analysis to establish the strength of association between witnessing severe domestic violence and childhood disorders. About 4% of children had witnessed severe domestic violence according to parent reports. Factors independently associated with a greater likelihood of a child witnessing domestic violence were: older age group, mixed ethnicity, physical disorder, several children in family, divorced parents, living in rented accommodation, poor neighbourhoods, the mother’s emotional state and family dysfunction. Witnessing severe domestic violence almost tripled the likelihood of children having conduct disorder but was not independently associated with emotional disorders. There is a growing need for more research on the consequences of witnessing domestic violence to increase the awareness of social workers and policy-makers to identify the needs of children who witness domestic violence.

Abstract = {We know little about first-episode psychosis epidemiology beyond cities or when measured through early intervention in psychosis services. We present results from 18 months of the 3-year Social Epidemiology of Psychoses in East Anglia (SEPEA) study of incepted incidence observed through five early intervention services. We identified 378 eligible individuals (incidence: 45.1/100 000 person-years, 95% CI 40.8–49.9). Rates varied across these services, but were 2–3 times higher than those on which services were commissioned. Risk decreased with age, was nearly doubled among men and differed by ethnic group; doubled in people of mixed ethnicity but lower for those of Asian origin, compared with White British people. Psychosis risk among ethnic minorities was lower than reported in urban settings, which has potential implications for aetiology. Our data suggest considerable psychosis morbidity in diverse, rural communities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate weight perception, dieting and emotional well being across the range of body mass index (BMI) in a population-based multiethnic sample of early adolescents. Design: Cross-sectional population-based survey. Subjects: In total, 2789 adolescents 11-14 years of age from three highly deprived regional authorities in East London, in 2001. Measurements: Data were collected by student-completed questionnaire on weight perception, dieting history, mental and physical health, health behaviours, social capital and sociodemographic factors. Height and weight were measured by trained researchers. Overweight was defined as BMI ≥85th centile and obesity as BMI ≥98th centile. Underweight was defined as BMI ≤15th centile. Results: In all, 73% were from ethnic groups other than white British. Valid BMI were available for 2522 subjects (90.4%) of whom 14% were obese. Only 20% of overweight boys and 51% of overweight girls assessed their weight accurately. Accuracy of weight perception did not vary between ethnic groups. In all, 42% of girls and 26% of boys reported current dieting to lose weight. Compared with white British teenagers, a history of dieting was more common among Bangladeshi, Indian and mixed ethnicity boys and less likely among Pakistani girls. Self-esteem was not associated with BMI in girls but was significantly lower in obese boys than those of normal weight (P = 0.02). Within ethnic subgroups, self-esteem was significantly lower in overweight white British boys (P = 0.03) and obese Bangladeshi boys (P = 0.01) and Bangladeshi girls (P = 0.04), but significantly higher in obese black African girls (P = 0.01) than those of normal weight. Obese young people had a higher prevalence of psychological distress (P = 0.04), except among Bangladeshi teenagers, where overweight and obese young people had less psychological distress than those of normal weight (P = 0.02). Birth outside the UK was associated with reduced risk of obesity in girls (P = 0.02) but not with history of dieting, weight perception or psychological factors in either gender. Conclusion: High levels of current dieting for weight control and inaccurate perception of body mass are common across all ethnic groups. However, dieting history and the associations of obesity with self-esteem and psychological distress vary between ethnic groups. Interventions to prevent or treat obesity in black or minority ethnicity groups must consider cultural differences in the relationship between body mass, self-esteem and psychological distress.

Abstract = {Epilepsy is poorly understood by the public and has been associated with numerous myths. This, coupled with its sometimes dramatic clinical manifestations, has often resulted in stigmatization of persons with epilepsy. A questionnaire to measure knowledge of, attitudes toward, and perceptions of epilepsy (KAPE) was adapted from previous studies and administered to students of the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago. The response rate was 91% (355 students). Knowledge was limited, especially with respect to epilepsy’s cause, its incidence, and management of an acute emergency. Attitudes toward epilepsy were generally positive. Students who knew someone with epilepsy scored significantly higher on knowledge and attitude questions. A stigma score was calculated to assess perceived stigmatization. There were no differences between the genders, but persons from rural areas and persons of mixed ethnicity perceived less stigmatization. Hindus perceived greater stigmatization than people of other religions. Overall, students still feel persons with epilepsy are discriminated against and experience stigmatization.

Abstract = {Objective: Private cord blood banks are for-profit companies that facilitate storage of umbilical cord blood for personal or family use. Pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians are currently best situated to use cord blood therapeutically. We sought to describe the experiences and views of these physicians regarding private cord blood banking. Participants and methods: We e-mailed a cross-sectional survey to pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians in the United States and Canada; 93 of 152 potentially eligible physicians (93 of 130 confirmed survey recipients) from 57 centers responded. Questions addressed the number of transplants performed by using privately banked cord blood, willingness to use banked autologous cord blood in specific clinical settings, and recommendations to parents regarding private cord blood banking. Results: Respondents reported having performed 9 autologous and 41 allogeneic transplants using privately banked cord blood. In 36 of 40 allogeneic cases for which data were available, the cord blood had been collected because of a known indication in the recipient. Few respondents would choose autologous cord blood over alternative stem cell sources for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second remission. In contrast, 55% would choose autologous cord blood to treat high-risk neuroblastoma, or to treat severe aplastic anemia in the absence of an available sibling donor. No respondent would recommend private cord blood banking for a newborn with 1 healthy sibling when both parents were of northern European descent; 11% would recommend banking when parents were of different minority ethnicities. Conclusions: Few transplants have been performed by using cord blood stored in the absence of a known indication in the recipient. Willingness to use banked autologous cord blood varies depending on disease and availability of alternative stem cell sources. Few pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians endorse private cord blood banking in the absence of an identified recipient, even for mixed-ethnicity children for whom finding a suitably matched unrelated donor may be difficult.

Abstract = {Notes that access to health care in the US is a function of many variables, including income, education, health insurance coverage (HIC), and ethnicity. This chapter briefly discusses the barriers associated with access to HIC and how this gateway to health care is associated with alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence (IPV). Specifically, the chapter examines the empirical data on HIC for treatment for IPV and alcoholism among ethnic Americans. An analysis of the 1995 Couples Study, comprising a total of 1,599 Black, Hispanic, White, and mixed ethnicity (in which the ethnicities of the partners did not match) heterosexual couples, is presented. Ss were interviewed about their demographic characteristics, alcohol consumption patterns, HIC, and the occurrence of 11 IPV behaviors. Results suggest that barriers to minority health care exist and are particularly prevalent among US Hispanics. Income was the most important factor in determining HIC status. Results suggest that minority couples who are affected by alcohol problems, including alcohol-related IPV, will be less likely to find the appropriate care to solve their problems. It is suggested that the inequality in access to care is likely to further contribute to the disparity in IPV across ethnic groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: The prevalence rates of disorders among a community-based sample of Hawaiian youths were determined and compared to previously published epidemiological studies. Method: Using a two-phase design, 7,317 adolescents were surveyed (60% participation rate), from which 619 were selected in a modified random sample during the 1992-1993 to 1995-1996 school years: 590 selected randomly and 29 at risk (i.e., Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression score of ≥35 and suicidal risk) from grades 9-12. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version 2.3, was used to determine DSM-III-R diagnoses. Prevalence rates, weighted for ethnicity, Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scores, and suicide attempts, were calculated for any diagnosis and various disorders. Meta-analyses compared the Hawai'i sample to four community-based studies (randomly selected youths from community populations) and two high-risk studies (homeless, low-income, or high unemployment communities). Results: Hawaiian females had the highest rate for any diagnosis (37.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 28.4%-48.0%) and non-Hawaiian males had the lowest rate (19.6%; 95% CI 14.8%-25.5%). Hawaiian males (26.8%; 95% CI 18.2%-37.5%) and non-Hawaiian females (27.9%; 95% CI 22.2%-34.4%) had intermediate and comparable rates. Overall, Hawaiians had significantly higher rates (32.7%; 95% CI 26.1%-40.1%) than non-Hawaiians (23.7%; 95% CI 19.9%-28.0%) when controlling for gender, and girls had significantly higher rates (30.8%; 95% CI 25.8%-36.3%) than boys (21.1%; 95% CI 16.8%-26.1%) when controlling for ethnicity. These findings were primarily the result of the significant differences in rates regarding anxiety disorders. Meta-analyses showed the Hawaiian youth rate for any diagnosis was comparable to high-risk studies and nearly three times higher than the community studies. Conclusions: Hawaiian youths, especially females, are at high risk. Research on the sociocultural factors that underpin both the genesis of and protection from psychopathology is imperative for Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian mixed-ethnicity youths.

Abstract = {Investigated how children use directives and forms of exclusion to organize play activity. Elementary school children of mixed ethnicity were observed playing the game of jump rope over the span of 1 mo. Girls' dominance in the game was observed to change over time. In mixed-sex groups where boys were learning how to jump, girls frequently set the agenda regarding how the game was to be played. However, as boys gained proficiency in the game, they became equal partners in calling plays and making decisions. Rather than finding differences in directive forms related to gender, the author found that the ability to use actions that tell others what to do in a very direct fashion in cross-sex interaction changes over time as children become more skilled in the activity.

Children were interviewed to test hypotheses about implicit racial biases, perceptions of similarity between peer dyads, and judgments about cross-race friendships. Implicit racial biases emerged when children evaluated ambiguous picture cards, with children viewing a White child as more likely to be a transgressor than a Black child in certain situations. There were no racial biases when evaluating potential cross-race friendship (it was judged to be feasible); nor was there any evidence of an outgroup homogeneity effect. Children who used ethnicity as a reason for judging peers to be similar, however, were less likely to judge that the cross-race dyads could be friends. The findings indicate the ways in which minority children's judgments about the majority and their perceptions of similarity between peer dyads influence their interpretations of peer interactions.

Abstract = {Comments on an article, Relative efficiency of chlamydia screening in non-clinical settings in two California counties by Morris et al. (2001). In December 2009, for a medical student research project, we conducted an on-site, self-administered, questionnaire survey of 250 consecutive genitourinary (GU) medicine clinic attendees to explore attitudes to chlamydia testing using a mailed test kit. Men would be asked about returning a urine sample and women a self-taken vaginal swab. The majority of responders (67%, 131/195) were women, and the mean age was 27 years (range 14-55). Of 196 responders, nearly one-third (32%) described themselves as being of black (African, Caribbean or mixed) ethnicity, 58% as white and the remainder as other ethnic groups. The main limitation to the study is that in spite of most respondents saying they would be willing to return postal samples for chlamydia testing, it is likely that actual response rates would be much less in practice. Our results from an ethnically diverse inner city population suggest that a public health campaign involving postal chlamydia testing could also contribute to the control of chlamydia infection in some ethnically diverse, possibly hard-to-reach populations.

Abstract = {The latency to withdrawal (LTW) is the expired time between the last cigarette and when the smoker feels the need to smoke again. The sensitization-homeostasis theory predicts that the LTW is inversely related to the frequency and duration of smoking such that more frequent cigarette consumption and a longer history of tobacco use will be associated with a shorter LTW. An anonymous cross-sectional survey of 1055 10th and 11th grade students of mixed ethnicity was conducted in two schools using self-completed questionnaires. Participants were asked "After you have smoked a cigarette, how long can you go before you feel you need to smoke again?" Of 162 current smokers, 73.5% reported a regular need to smoke and a LTW. Reported values for the LTW ranged from .05 h to "3 weeks or more." Monthly cigarette consumption ranged from 1 to 895. The LTW correlated inversely with monthly cigarette consumption (Kendall's tau b = -.53, P < .001) and the duration of smoking (Kendall's tau b = -.25, P < .001) as predicted by the sensitization-homeostasis theory.

Abstract = {Objective: We aimed to determine the frequency of all known forms of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) in a large Australasian cohort. Methods: We screened 101 patients with CMD with a combination of immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and DNA sequencing to identify disease-associated abnormalities in glycosylated α-dystroglycan, collagen VI, laminin α2, α7-integrin, and selenoprotein. Results: A total of 45% of the CMD cohort were assigned to an immunofluorescent subgroup based on their abnormal staining pattern. Abnormal staining for glycosylated α-dystroglycan was present in 25% of patients, and approximately half of these had reduced glycosylated α-dystroglycan by Western blot. Sequencing of the FKRP, fukutin, POMGnT1, and POMT1 genes in all patients with abnormal α-dystroglycan immunofluorescence identified mutations in one patient for each of these genes and two patients had mutations in POMT2. Twelve percent of patients had abnormalities in collagen VI immunofluorescence, and we identified disease-causing COL6 mutations in eight of nine patients in whom the genes were sequenced. Laminin α2 deficiency accounted for only 8% of CMD. α7-Integrin staining was absent in 12 of 45 patients studied, and ITGA7 gene mutations were excluded in all of these patients. Conclusions: We define the distribution of different forms of congenital muscular dystrophy in a large cohort of mixed ethnicity and demonstrate the utility and limitations of current diagnostic techniques.

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine Army women’s condom use patterns, reasons for condom use and nonuse, and what is liked about and problems associated with condom use. Methods: Army women (n = 131) from military posts around the country were recruited. The women ranged in age from 18 to 68 years (M = 30.5, SD = 10.5). The sample was of mixed ethnicity. Questionnaires were distributed by the units and returned directly to the principal investigator. Participants completed a series of anonymous open- and closed-ended questions regarding their experiences with condoms. Closed-ended questions were analyzed with descriptive statistics and open-ended responses were content analyzed (McLaughlin & Marascuilo, 1990). Conclusions: Regular condom use was low in this sample. The most often cited responses as to why women liked using condoms included peace of mind, protection, or ease of use. The most cited problems and subsequent disuse included irritation/inflammation, breakage, improper fit, or ruining the moment. Results differed by consistency of condom use. Regular users of condoms reported a lower percentage of problems using condoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {During the last two decades, there has been a growing emphasis on the delivery of health care to meet the needs of minority ethnic patients, but there is less emphasis on the views of the patients themselves. This paper aimed to give minority ethnic groups the opportunity to voice their opinions on nursing care and to inform future nurse education. Focus groups were used to collect data. Six community groups, some of mixed ethnicity and some of specific ethnic identity, were included in the study. Data were analysed using a thematic approach and three themes were identified as representing the views of the participants. Participants identified that knowledge of cultural and religious practices were essential for nurses in order for them to understand the basis of their beliefs and practices. They also highlighted how the actions and behaviour of nurses either confirmed or ignored their specific requirements. They also recognised the inherent communication problems for those who had difficulty in communicating in English. Overall, they reiterated their need to be treated with dignity and respect. For nurse educators, the challenge is to develop not only the knowledge base of student nurses but also to help them translate that into practice that demonstrates cultural understanding and sensitivity.

Abstract = {Background: A study, entitled Evaluation of an Intervention Aimed at Resolving Behavioural Sleep Problems in 6- to 12-month-old Infants: A Pilot Study, was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a behavioural sleep intervention. This descriptive qualitative study aimed to describe parents' perceptions of the sleep intervention and any burden associated with participating in the study. Methods: Fourteen of the 35 families who had participated in the quantitative study were interviewed. Respondents comprised well-educated, middle-class and mixed-ethnicity families. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, with open-ended trigger questions, and were analysed using inductive content analysis. Result: Nine themes, which subsumed a number of categories, were constructed. Parents changed their perspectives about sleep and parenting styles; they experienced many challenges and inadvertent benefits; and they welcomed a structured framework for assisting with sleep problems. The parents fitted intervention strategies into their realities; many factors interfered with their success; and their support systems and their expectations of the study varied. Conclusion: These parents' previous education about normal infant sleep cycles and behavioural sleep problems was inadequate. The parents who were able to use the structured framework, flexible strategies and access to healthcare professionals for problem solving not only excelled in resolving their infants' sleep problems, but also gained confidence about their parenting skills and success.

Abstract = {Background: The natural intervention of a new light-rail stop in a neighborhood is examined for relationships with ridership and moderate-activity bouts. Design: At Time 1, surveys and 1-week accelerometer readings assess transit use and moderate-activity bouts. One year later (Time 2), after the opening of a new light-rail stop, measures were repeated. Setting/Participants: During the summers of 2005 and 2006, 51 residents participated from a low-income, mixed ethnicity neighborhood in Salt Lake City, Utah. Intervention: A new light-rail stop was built and opened in the middle of the surveyed neighborhood. Main Outcome Measures: Physical activity was measured as a bout of 8 or more minutes of moderate activity (3.0 metabolic units [METS]), according to accelerometer counts, controlling for hours worn. Prompted recalls allowed moderate-activity bouts to be labeled as walks to transit or not. Results: Analyses in 2006-2007 show that the percentage of rail riders increased significantly, from 50% to 68.75%, after the stop opened. In cross-sectional analyses at Times 1 and 2, self-reported rides on light rail were significantly related to more moderate-activity bouts, controlling for gender, household size, and home ownership. Longitudinally, with the same control variables and adding Time 1 moderate activity, light-rail rides at Time 2 predicted increased Time 2 moderate activity. Conclusions: A new rail stop was associated with increased ridership. Walks to light rail were associated, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with moderate-activity bouts.

Abstract = {Conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions for women in the USA. 24 articles from 1989 to 1997 were included. The authors evaluated 5 ethnic groupings (All Ethnicities Combined, African-American, White, Hispanic and a Mixed Ethnicity group) over 4 time periods (post-test, less than 2 mo after the intervention, 2-3 mo after the intervention and 6-24 mo after the intervention) on 3 HIV-related sexuality outcome variables (HIV/AIDS knowledge, self-efficacy and sexual risk reduction behavior). The HIV interventions appear effective at improving knowledge about HIV/AIDS and increasing sexual risk reduction behaviors for all ethnicities examined at all follow-up periods, with one exception. The findings for self-efficacy are less consistent. The interventions were less consistently effective for African-American women, for whom significant improvements in feelings of self-efficacy were only seen 6 mo or longer after the intervention. The present analysis elucidates ethnic differences which may have previously been obscured while demonstrating convincingly that HIV interventions are generally effective for women of many different ethnicities.

Abstract = {Background: Research has sought to understand how environmental factors influence adolescent physical activity, yet little is known about where and with whom adolescents are physically active. Purpose: This study used electronic ecological momentary assessment (e.EMA) to map the social and physical contexts of exercise and walking across adolescence. Differences in physical activity contexts by gender, grade in school, day of the week, and season were examined. Methods: Twice a year between 9th and 12th grade, 502 adolescents (51% female) of mixed ethnicity (55% White) participated in 4-day e.EMA intervals (Thursday-Sunday) where their primary activity (e.g., exercise, TV, homework), social company (e.g., friends, family, class), and physical location (e.g., home, school, outdoors) were assessed every 30 (±10) min during waking hours. Results: Overall, greater proportions of exercise and walking were reported with friends, outdoors, and at school. However, boys were more likely to report exercising and walking in outdoor locations than girls. Exercising with classmates, family, and at school decreased across high school. Walking with family, friends, and outdoors also decreased. On weekdays compared to weekends, students reported a greater proportion of their exercise and walking at school. Students were more likely to report exercising and walking outdoors in the fall and the spring than in the winter. Conclusion: e.EMA showed that the social and physical contexts of adolescent exercise and walking vary as a function of gender, grade in school, day of the week, and season. Understanding the contexts of physical activity during the high school years can be helpful in designing interventions during adolescence.

Abstract = {Objective: To determine among male adolescents whether bully-victims would report the poorest psychosocial health, the worst attitudes toward school, more problem behavior (delinquency, weapons possession, and substance use), and more physical injury compared with bullies, victims, and neutral students. We also assessed ethnic differences in bullying category membership. Methods: Employing multisample latent variable models, we contrasted 1,312 males in grades 7-12 classified as bullies (n = 299), victims (n = 180), bully-victims (n = 195), and neutral (n = 638) on school attitudes, psychosocial health, problem behaviors, and physical injury. Results: Hypotheses were generally confirmed, especially contrasts between bully-victims and neutrals. However, bullies did not have better school attitudes than bully-victims, and victims only marginally reported better psychological health than bully-victims. The boys of mixed ethnicity were more likely to be victims. Conclusions: Greater awareness of the problems associated with boys who both bully and are victimized is necessary for improved intervention.

The sample consisted of 44 maltreated and 56 nonmaltreated children (females = 51) of mixed ethnicity. Subjects were administered a 20-item measure of attributional processes. The results indicated that relative to nonmaltreated children, physically abused boys were more likely to attribute hostile intentions to a variety of relationship figures, including their parents, an unfamiliar teacher, their best friend, and unfamiliar peers. A positive relation was also found between the frequency of physical abuse and hostile attributional tendencies among males. Finally, support was found for the role of children's hostile attributions of their mothers in mediating the relation between physical abuse and children's hostile attributions of unfamiliar peers. The results support a link between physical abuse and hostile attributional tendencies in children in early elementary school. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined multiracial differences by gender regarding course choice in a summer enrichment program. Ss comprised 804 academically talented students (mean age 14.54 yrs) of Asian- American, White, Hispanic, African-American, American-Indian, or mixed ethnicity. Ss attending a summer enrichment program completed questionnaires regarding internally and externally focused reasons for choosing a course. Results show that male Ss enrolled in traditionally male (TM) courses in significantly greater numbers than they enrolled in traditionally female (TF) courses; female enrollment in the 2 types of courses was more evenly distributed. Asian-American Ss' course enrollment in TM and TF courses was more balanced than enrollments by non-Asian American Ss, and Asian-American Ss endorsed fewer internal reasons than did non-Asian Americans. Ss in TM classes endorsed more external reasons for course choice than did Ss in TF classes. Ss who gave more internal reasons for course choice reported enjoying classes more than did Ss who gave more external reasons. No differences were observed concerning the effect of gender on motivation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Argues that facial expression is an important source of information about infant and caregiver behavior, but human observer-based methods of measuring facial expression are semiquantitative, labor intensive, and difficult to standardize across laboratories and over time. When subject recruitment and observational assessments span several years or multiple sites and population, it is difficult to maintain consistent criteria. It is contended that these are serious limiting factors, especially in large, multisite, longitudinal studies. An automated method of facial expression analysis (Automated Face Analysis) that was developed by the authors is discussed. The authors present evidence indicating that the Automated Face Analysis demonstrated high concurrent validity with manual Facial Action Coding System coding, and in the cross-validation set that included subjects of mixed ethnicity, average recognition accuracy for 3 action units ranged from 85–93% depending on the module. It is suggested that with continued development, Automated Face Analysis will greatly reduce or eliminate the need for manual coding, make feasible the use of larger, more representative data sets, and open new areas of investigation.

Abstract = {Gordon Allport (1960) once noted that there are many different approaches to conflict resolution, but that few empirical studies have been conducted to examine their effectiveness. This experiment was designed to evaluate the distributive bargaining, integrative bargaining, and interactive problem solving models of conflict resolution, using intergroup expectancies and attitudes as dependent measures. Jewish and Arab students were paired into mixed-ethnicity dyads to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian dispute about Jerusalem according to one of the three models. It was hypothesized that dyad members using the interactive problem solving model would become the least pessimistic about the conflict, and would show the greatest positive change in their attitudes toward members of the other ethnic group. The results support these predictions, and help to make up for the paucity of research on the assessment of conflict resolution strategies.

Abstract = {The Cultural Involvement and Detachment Anxiety Questionnaire (D. W. McNeil et al, 1998) and the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (I. S. Phinney, 1992) were administered to 160 Navajo college students (mean age 25.7 yrs) to explore the relation between ethnic identity and culturally related anxiety, compare level of ethnic identity in reference to standardized samples, and test for gender differences. Correlations indicated a notable lack of relation between ethnic identity and cultural anxiety. This particular Navajo sample evidenced significantly higher levels of ethnic identity in comparison to students of Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, or mixed ethnicity. There were no significant gender differences in culturally related anxiety. Results are discussed in relation to culturally related anxiety and ethnic identity in the Navajo, with implications for better understanding the nature of cultural anxiety in other American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Abstract = {Although the use of focus group methodology is increasing in social science research, few empirical evaluations of this method are found in the literature. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the utility of focus groups as a research method. We present a study in which a mixed-ethnicity sample of 44 men, ages 18–43 years, participated in both an individual interview and a focus group discussion covering 4 identical topics related to intimate and sexual relationships. Although both methods generated similar conclusions, a greater range and richness–depth of themes were present in the individual setting. However, dynamic interactions in the focus group setting provided insight beyond the content themes. Theories of small group dynamics are used to discuss our findings.

Abstract = {Examined the relationship of safer sex behavior practices, knowledge of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), social norms, and familiarity with persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with HIV risk appraisal in women. Risk appraisal was measured by perceived susceptibility and seriousness of AIDS. The AIDS Risk Reduction Model was used to construct a salient framework for this descriptive, correlational survey in which 208 urban women (aged 18–42 yrs) of mixed ethnicity residing in areas with high rates of sexually transmitted diseases/AIDS participated. Findings show that behavior, knowledge, and social norms contributed significant amounts of variance to perceived susceptibility but none of the independent variables contributed significant amounts of variance in perceived seriousness. Overall the findings indicate that risk behaviors are commonly reported, AIDS knowledge is incomplete, and denial of risk is pronounced.

In addition to the determination of intercorrelations among the 10 self-concept measures reflecting in part different perceptual frames of reference, validity coefficients were obtained for each subsample between scores on each of the 10 self-concept scales and teachers' ratings of Ss' achievement in mathematics and reading. In general, Ss self-reports about self-concept revealed negligible relationships with teacher ratings, although teacher observations of Ss' self-concepts yielded modest correlations with achievement ratings.
