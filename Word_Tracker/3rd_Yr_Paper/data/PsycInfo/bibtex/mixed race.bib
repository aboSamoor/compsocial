Abstract = {Over the last two decades, lay and professional interest in Britain's ‘mixed-race’ population has markedly increased, following dramatic growth in mixing and mixedness. As is often the case with new phenomena, agencies in the sphere of popular culture have stepped in to offer the wider public interpretative representations of this ‘new’ group. Drawing on challenging concepts, like demographic growth rates and projections, the family ‘norm’, the ostensible benefits of heterozygosity, and the drawbacks of claimed ‘in-betweenness’, they have offered us a picture of the ‘mixed-race’ population that is sometimes at variance with lived experiences or the harder image of statistical reality. Social representation theory is used to explore the limitations of these representations and to offer a number of counter-narratives that are grounded in the evidence base.

The book is composed of 11 chapters organized around two levels of research: (1) societies with established populations of mixed descent, and (2) societies with newer populations of mixed descent. The chapters offer the reader a rich narrative that explores the complex process of the social construction of concepts that describe populations around the world that are mixed race or mixed descent or populations that have mixed identities. The book as a whole and many of the chapters do make a significant contribution to the general understanding of mixed populations around the world.

Abstract = {There are concerns over nonmedical use of prescription stimulants among youths, but little is known about the extent of use among young Asian-Americans, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs), and mixed-race individuals—the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population. We examined prevalences and correlates of nonmedical stimulant use (NMSU) and disorder (StiUD) for these underrecognized groups. Whites were included as a comparison. Data were from young individuals aged 12–34 years in the 2005–2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. We used logistic regression to estimate odds of past-year NMSU status. Significant yearly increases in lifetime NMSU prevalence were noted in Whites only. NHs/PIs (lifetime 7.33%, past-year 2.72%) and mixed-race individuals (10.20%, 2.82%) did not differ from Whites in NMSU prevalence (11.68%, 3.15%). Asian-Americans (lifetime 3.83%, past-year 0.90%) had lower prevalences than Whites. In each racial/ethnic group, “Methamphetamine/Desoxyn/Methedrine or Ritalin” was more commonly used than other stimulant groups; “got them from a friend/relative for free” and “bought them from a friends/relative” were among the most common sources. Females had greater odds than males of NMSU (among White, NH/PI, mixed-race individuals) and StiUD (among mixed-race individuals). Young adults (aged 18–25) had elevated odds of NMSU (White, NH/PI); adolescents had elevated odds of StiUD (White, mixed-race). Other substance use (especially marijuana, other prescription drugs) increased odds of NMSU and StiUD. NHs/PIs and mixed-race individuals were as likely as Whites to misuse stimulants. Research is needed to delineate health consequences of NMSU and inform prevention efforts for these understudied, rapidly-growing populations.

Abstract = {Identity integration among bicultural individuals refers to the perception that their two cultural identities are compatible. Previous research has shown that identity integration is likely to lead to enhanced creativity. However, this research was conducted among first‐ and second‐generation immigrants, but not among mixed‐race individuals. The current research examined identity integration and creativity among mixed‐race individuals. We also explored the role of integrated identity experiences at home. We found that identity integration was related to increases in creativity; and this was partly mediated via integrated identity experiences at home. Our findings suggest that positive bicultural experiences at home may create a context for the individual to integrate their biracial identities; and this is ultimately beneficial for creativity.

Abstract = {In this chapter, the authors interrogate the relationship between mixed-race identities and Canadian multiculturalism. The authors begin by briefly summarizing the history of the Canadian state-sponsored multiculturalism project. The authors also provide some general facts and figures about racial mixing in Canada before offering examples of the ways that some mixed-race Canadians understand multiculturalism as an ideology, policy, and demographic reality. More specifically, the authors suggest that mixed racialized identities can be superficially celebrated as living proof of the success of multiculturalism and in turn, a supposedly inclusive Canada. Yet, at the same time, mixed-race people continue to be racialized into categories of non-Whiteness and positioned outside of the nation-state. Mixed-race people play a crucial role because of the way they are positioned as key stakeholders in the success of multicultural policy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This chapter discusses mixed-race in the decennial UK census and whether the approaches sustainable in the age of globalization and super-diversity. Multiethnic states such as Britain face various challenges in the classification and enumeration of ethnic minority, populations in the future due to two main demographic changes. First, in the new global migration, many of the new-migrant groups have no link historically or culturally to Britain's colonial past, but comprise what Kymlicka calls "polyethnic minorities." Second, a significant growth in mixed partnerships and people, and their increasingly diverse modes of identification, poses key questions about the validity and reliability of official classifications. Understandings of "race" and the significance of ethnic and racial difference are not only changeable across time, but are also sensitive to specific contexts and localities. Understandings of "race" and "mixed race" are moving targets, and thus there is always a potential disjuncture between ordinary understandings and practices "on the ground," and official measures of such complex phenomena. Where there is a need for data on the ethnic diversity of the population, new forms of data collection are needed. At a population group level, multiticking probably offers the best opportunity, in spite of concerns about data quality and response stability. However, "origins-based 'groupness'" may best be captured by an ancestry or ethnic origins question of the type that has been asked in the US and Canadian censuses.

Abstract = {This chapter examines the history of multiracial American Japanese who grew up in Okinawa and the US during the post-World War II period through the 1970s. The author contextualize their lives historically and document them with oral history interviews focusing on people who grew up in Okinawa. Their transnational lives provide insight on the human experience of multiraciality. The reason for focusing on Okinawa is twofold: the first because of Okinawa's status as a repeatedly colonized space, by Japan in 1879, and later by the US from 1945 to 1972; and secondly on the basis as a place where a "third space" hybrid culture exists for mixed-race people as a result of the long term US military presence." It is important to study this age group for several reasons. First, many of them have a more concrete sense of their own identity than people who are in their teens or twenties. Second, in the academic literature on multiracial people following World War II, their voices are largely absent while the focus is on their parents, caretakers, or adoptive parents. Third, beginning with occupied Japan as a birthplace for mixed people who embody a third culture in a semi-colonized space, and later looking at this group as American immigrants, the research offers new openings for discussion about the current models of racial formation of mixed and marginalized people and how race is reinforced historically across borders.

Abstract = {In this chapter, the authors consider the ways in which mixed-race identities are constructed in Australia and New Zealand, both relatively new nation states with histories as British settler societies. Australia and New Zealand have experienced little debate in the public sphere about mixed race and minimal impact from international discussion on the subject. Even media coverage of Barack Obama as mixed race at the time of his election did not trigger a conversation about racial terminology. Likewise when Australia's former prime minister John Howard commented that he would prefer a multiracial policy rather than a multicultural one, the comment fell into a void. The issues that have claimed most prominence in relation to race in both Australia and New Zealand have been the effects of migrant intake and the interaction between colonizers, other immigrants, and indigenous peoples. Australia and New Zealand are relatively young countries, built around a model of the nation-state as it emerged in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This model implies close links between ethno-racial and political identity, and as such fits uncomfortably within settler societies, which have generally grown through constant migration of people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds, often resulting in mixed offspring. Neither Australia nor New Zealand has formally named mixed race populations, in the way that Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, colonial India, and some other countries have. Race is rarely an explicit focus of current policies in Australia and New Zealand, and neither country offers a color option in their census. This chapter uses several examples to illustrate the complexities of dealing with mixed race in contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Using nationally representative data from the 2010 and 2012 America’s Barometer survey, the authors examine patterns of self-identification in four countries. National differences in the relation between skin color, socioeconomic status, and race were found. Skin color predicts race closely in Panama but loosely in the Dominican Republic. Moreover, despite the dominant belief that money whitens, the authors discover that status polarizes (Brazil), mestizoizes (Colombia), darkens (Dominican Republic), or has no effect (Panama). The results show that race is both physical and cultural, with country variations in racial schema that reflect specific historical and political trajectories.

Abstract = {Background: The racial/ethnic composition of the United States is shifting rapidly, with non-Hispanic Asian-Americans, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs), and mixed-race individuals the fastest growing segments of the population. We determined new drug use estimates for these rising groups. Prevalences among Whites were included as a comparison. Methods: Data were from the 2005–2011 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Substance use among respondents aged ≥12 years was assessed by computer-assisted self-interviewing methods. Respondents’ self-reported race/ethnicity, age, gender, household income, government assistance, county type, residential stability, major depressive episode, history of being arrested, tobacco use, and alcohol use were examined as correlates. We stratified the analysis by race/ethnicity and used logistic regression to estimate odds of drug use. Results: Prevalence of past-year marijuana use among Whites increased from 10.7% in 2005 to 11.6–11.8% in 2009–2011 (P < 0.05). There were no significant yearly changes in drug use prevalences among Asian-Americans, NHs/PIs, and mixed-race people; but use of any drug, especially marijuana, was prevalent among NHs/PIs and mixed-race people (21.2% and 23.3%, respectively, in 2011). Compared with Asian-Americans, NHs/PIs had higher odds of marijuana use, and mixed-race individuals had higher odds of using marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens, stimulants, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Compared with Whites, mixed-race individuals had greater odds of any drug use, mainly marijuana, and NHs/PIs resembled Whites in odds of any drug use. Conclusions: Findings reveal alarmingly prevalent drug use among NHs/PIs and mixed-race people. Research on drug use is needed in these rising populations to inform prevention and treatment efforts.

We examined substance use disorder (SUD) prevalences and comorbidities among AAs, NHs/PIs, and MRs (N = 4572) in a behavioral health electronic health record database. DSM-IV diagnoses among patients aged 1-90 years who accessed behavioral healthcare from 11 sites were systematically captured: SUD, anxiety, mood, personality, adjustment, childhood-onset, cognitive/dementia, dissociative, eating, factitious, impulse-control, psychotic/schizophrenic, sleep, and somatoform diagnoses. Of all patients, 15.0% had a SUD. Mood (60%), anxiety (31.2%), adjustment (30.9%), and disruptive (attention deficit-hyperactivity, conduct, oppositional defiant, disruptive behavior diagnosis, 22.7%) diagnoses were more common than others (psychotic 14.2%, personality 13.3%, other childhood-onset 11.4%, impulse-control 6.6%, cognitive 2.8%, eating 2.2%, somatoform 2.1%). Less than 1% of children aged < 12 years had SUD. Cannabis diagnosis was the primary SUD affecting adolescents aged 12e17. MRs aged 35-49 years had the highest prevalence of cocaine diagnosis. Controlling for age at first visit, sex, treatment setting, length of treatment, and number of comorbid diagnoses, NHs/PIs and MRs were about two times more likely than AAs to have ≥ 2 SUDs. Regardless of race/ethnicity, personality diagnosis was comorbid with SUD. NHs/PIs with a mood diagnosis had elevated odds of having SUD. Findings present the most comprehensive patterns of mental diagnoses available for treatment-seeking AAs, NHs/PIs, and MRs in the real-world medical setting.

Chapters address the ways mixed-race individuals defy, bolster, speak, and live racial categorization, paying attention to the ways that these experiences help us think through how we see and engage with social differences.

Abstract = {Background: Non-Hispanic Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs), and mixed-race individuals are the fastest growing segments of the US population. We examined prevalences and correlates of tobacco use among these understudied groups. Prevalences among whites were included as a comparison. Methods: Data were drawn from the 2002–2010 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Respondents aged ≥12 years were assessed for current (past-month) use of cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco (chewing tobacco, snuff), and pipe tobacco. Respondents’ race/ethnicity, age, sex, household income, government assistance, urbanicity of residence, residential stability, self-rated health, alcohol use, and drug use were examined as correlates. Results: Between 2002 and 2010, there was a decline in the prevalence of cigarette smoking among whites (26.9% in 2002; 24.3% in 2010) and Asian Americans (18.0% in 2002; 11.1% in 2010). Prevalence of pipe tobacco use among mixed-race individuals increased from 0.2% in 2002 to 1.6% in 2010; there was little change in the prevalence of cigar and smokeless tobacco use in these racial/ethnic groups. Adjusted analyses showed that, compared with Asian Americans, mixed-race individuals had greater odds of using four tobacco products, and NHs/PIs had greater odds of using cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Regardless of race/ethnicity, male sex was a correlate of use of cigars, smokeless tobacco, and pipe tobacco; alcohol and drug use increased the odds of cigarette and cigar smoking. Conclusions: These new findings show prevalent tobacco use among NHs/PIs and mixed-race individuals, and highlight the importance of including these populations in future research and reporting.

Abstract = {This paper introduces a group of white working-class women living on a council estate in the UK drawing on an ethnographic study conducted between 2005 and 2009, examining the impact of class inequality and a stigmatized living space in an ethnically diverse urban neighbourhood. All of the women are mothers and have mixed-race children; they reside on the St Ann’s estate in Nottingham, an inner-city neighbourhood that has been subject to poor housing, poverty and unemployment for many generations. The women who live on this estate say that they suffer from negative stereotypes and stigmatization because of the notoriety of the estate, because they are working class and because they have had sexual relationships with black men. However, there is a sense of connectedness to the estate and there are strong cultural meanings that are heavily influenced by the West Indian community. This paper then highlights the importance of place when focusing upon families, class inequality and intercultural relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Gender- and race-bias have often been studied as separate phenomena, but examining intersections of race and gender is critical given that people always belong to many social categories simultaneously. In two studies, we focus on the evaluation of mixed-sex work teams, and examine how race and gender of team members affect the evaluations they receive. Participants read about a pair of employees assigned to work together on a “masculine” task on which they either succeeded (Study 1) or failed (Study 2). Mixed-sex teams included White pairs, Black pairs, or mixed race pairs (White woman–Black man; Black woman–White man). In both studies, pro-male gender bias was evident only in the White male–White female work pair. We suggest that rather than suffering the double jeopardy of dual subordinate identities, Black women were buffered from the effects of gender bias by virtue of their non-prototypicality or invisibility.

Abstract = {Social work scholarship concerned with mixed-race and queer identities is growing and ever-changing, yet often treats race and sexuality as separate experiences independent from context and environment. In addition, in studies of mixed-race people, the legacy of the Black-White/US-based multiracial paradigm and the history of such research using race as the only or primary analytic has left a dearth of studies that seek to understand mixed-race experiences within geographical, transnational and intersectional contexts. In this paper, we extend previous work focused on situational and contextual multiracial identities through an interview-based study of a sample of 12 queer and mixed-race individuals. We employ a narrative analysis to explore how emergent themes of geography and migration are salient to self-making processes of participants. Findings include: (1) diverse geographic and migration histories among participants; (2) interviewees’ use of discursive strategies that draw upon experiences of geography and migration within the narrative structure; and (3) the critical role of geography and migration in expanding and changing participants’ identity discourses and in shaping individuals’ identity and sense of community. Ultimately, this work serves as a call for on-going attention to how geography and migration, as well as intersectional and transnational perspectives, add depth and texture to studies of queer-mixed people while also offering specificity to social work’s broader commitment to context and environment.

Abstract = {Large-scale surveys have shown elevated risk for many indicators of substance abuse among Native American and Mixed-Race adolescents compared to other minority groups in the United States. This study examined underlying contextual factors associated with substance abuse among a nationally representative sample of White, Native American, and Mixed-Race adolescents 12–17 years of age, using combined datasets from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH 2006–2009, N = 46,675, 48.77 % female). Native American adolescents displayed the highest rate of past-month binge drinking and past-year illicit drug use (14.06 and 30.91 %, respectively). Results of a logistic regression that included seven predictors of social bonding, individual views of substance use, and delinquent peer affiliations showed that friendships with delinquent peers and negative views of substance use were associated significantly with both substance abuse outcomes among White and Mixed-Race adolescents and, to a lesser extent, Native American adolescents. The association of parental disapproval with binge drinking was stronger for White than for Native American adolescents. Greater attention to specific measures reflecting racial groups’ contextual and historical differences may be needed to delineate mechanisms that discourage substance abuse among at-risk minority adolescent populations.

Abstract = {Objective: Although births of multiracial and multiethnic infants are becoming more common in the United States, little is known about birth outcomes and risks for adverse events. We evaluated risk of fetal death for mixed race couples compared with same race couples and examined the role of prematurity and low birth weight as potential mediating risk factors. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using data from the 1998–2002 California Birth Cohort to evaluate the odds of fetal death, low birth weight, and prematurity for couples with a mother and father who were categorized as either being of same or different racial groups. Risk of prematurity (birth prior to 37 weeks gestation) and low birth weight (<2500g) were also tested to see if the model could explain variations among groups. Results: The analysis included approximately 1.6 million live births and 1749 stillbirths. In the unadjusted model, compared with two white parents, black/black and black/white couples had a significantly higher risk of fetal death. When all demographic, social, biological, genetic, congenital, and procedural risk factors except gestational age and birth weight were included, the odds ratios (OR) were all still significant. Black/black couples had the highest level of risk (OR 2.11, CI 1.77-2.51), followed by black mother/white father couples (OR 2.01, CI 1.16-3.48), and white mother/black father couples (OR 1.84, CI 1.33-2.54). Virtually all of the higher risk of fetal death was explainable by higher rates of low birth weight and prematurity. Conclusions: Mixed race black and white couples face higher odds of prematurity and low birth weight, which appear to contribute to the substantially higher demonstrated risk for stillbirth. There are likely additional unmeasured factors that influence birth outcomes for mixed race couples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {During the same time period, the United States, Great Britain and Canada all moved towards ‘counting’ mixed-race on their national censuses. In the United States, this move is largely attributed to the existence of a mixed-race social movement that pushed Congress for the change—but similar developments in Canada and Britain occurred without the presence of a politically active civil society devoted to making the change. Why the convergence? This article argues that demographic trends, increasingly unsettled perceptions about discrete racial categories, and a transnational norm surrounding the primacy of racial self-identification in census-taking culminated in a normative shift towards multiracial multiculturalism. Therein, mixed-race identities are acknowledged as part of—rather than problematic within—diverse societies. These elements enabled mixed-race to be promoted, at times strategically, as a corollary of multiculturalism in these three countries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

A sample of 300 students between 14 to 19 years old was selected, of which 107 were Wixaritari indigenous and 193 were mixed race from the north of Jalisco, Mexico. Assessed variables were knowledge about HIV/STI, locus of control for the HIV infection, concern about HIV/STI and attitudes towards condom use. Statistically significant differences based on gender were found, in the variables internal locus of control, attitudes towards condom use and knowledge about HIV/STI. We did not find differences in the variable concern about HIV/STI. Wixaritari indigenous adolescents, regardless of gender, are exposed to a higher level of risk of HIV infection than mixed race adolescents. It is necessary to keep on researching about other variables that could intervene in preventive behavior in indigenous population, and make HIV prevention programs suitable for the population.

Abstract = {This study examined the understanding of children’s rights in 63 (9-, 11-, and 13-year-olds) mixed-race South African children and their mothers. In individual semistructured interviews participants responded to hypothetical vignettes in which children’s nurturance and self-determination rights conflicted with parental authority in the home. Participants were required to decide whether they should support the story characters’ rights and provide justifications for their responses. Findings indicated that both children and mothers were more likely to endorse children’s nurturance than self-determination rights. In contrast to previous research, no significant differences were found between children and mothers in terms of support for either type of right. In terms of reasoning, both children’s and mothers’ responses revealed distinct patterns of thinking influenced by the type of right under consideration. The findings are discussed with reference to the available western and non-western literature on children’s understanding of rights. Limitations, implications, and directions for future research are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Multiracial individuals are in the unique position of being able to categorize themselves as members of multiple racial groups. Drawing on self-categorization theory, we suggest that similarity to the minority ingroup depends on self-perceptions of physical appearance and connectedness to the minority ingroup. Moreover, we argue that similarity to the ingroup determines self-categorization as minority, which predicts category-based entitlements such as perceived eligibility for minority resources (e.g., affirmative action). Using path analysis, we found support for this model on a convenience sample of 107 mixed-race minority–White participants. The results suggest that affective processes rather than observable characteristics such as prototypical physical appearance better predict self-categorization among mixed-race individuals.

Abstract = {This chapter discusses gender, identity, and "race mixing" in the Trinidad and Tobago nation. The tension between these two strands of identity formation has been central to notions of citizenship in Trinidad and Tobago, although it is not normally discussed in these terms. Interestingly, purist notions of Africanness are also incompatible with the hegemonic hybrid national identity. Still today many people have difficulty in identifying themselves as African—a source of constant disappointment to Afrocentric groups and individuals. The public creole mainstream, therefore, is perceived as a hybrid space, a place where prior "pure" identities become mixed. But it is also a place, possibly due to its identification with "Blackness," which is seen as impure, vulgar, immoral, sexual, and masculine. The author clearly demonstrates in this chapter that the situation of mixed-race people today in various countries has a great deal to do with the dominant colonial influence. While various nations share common features, they also demonstrate unique trajectories and configurations of mixedness, depending, for example, on the former colonial power and the cultural heritage of those who trace their lineage to it. This is evident even within the circum-Caribbean region, as can be seen from the chapter in this book on Mexico. Contemporary forces of globalization are currently stirring up the cultural categories to a significant degree, but it does not override them.

I do this through a comparison of two potentially mixed-race identities, the afro-indigenous Garifuna of Honduras and peoples of East Indian and African mixture (douglas) in Trinidad. Through this comparison I show that in both Honduras and Trinidad classification of mixed-race peoples can follow the logic of the racial binary or of the racial continuum depending on the historical context and the particular mix. I also discuss the way that mixed-race identities can sometimes be radical critiques of state racial projects of pluralism and at other times they can be the basis of state racial projects meant to obfuscate racial pluralism.

Abstract = {This chapter examines the experiences of mixed people based on more than 40 in-depth, open-ended interviews conducted in Kazakhstan with ethnically mixed individuals, some of whom came of age in the Soviet era and others since 1991. The interviews have included mixed people in a variety of combinations—Russian Kazakh, Kazakh Tatar, Russian Korean, Armenian Ukrainian, Russian Azerbaijani, Russian Ingush, and others. Of the various respondents, only people of mixed Central Asian/European background would be considered mixed race in US terms. However, ft is important to stress that this is not the main way "Eurasians" are understood in Kazakhstan, where views of the fault lines within the population differ from those in the United States. While there is a recognition that one can often distinguish Kazakhs from Russians visually, the broader category "Asian" in Kazakhstan is nevertheless primarily defined in religious, linguistic, cultural, and geographic, not racial, terms. Kazakhs, Tajiks, Tatars, Turkmens, Azerbaijanis—all are "Asians" because they are Muslims, speak Turkic or Persianate languages, and hail from the Soviet "East," not primarily because of their physical features.

But to what extent can we say that there is ‘a’ mixed race group in Britain today? If such a group exists, what commonalities underlie the experience of being mixed? In addressing this question, I draw on a study of the racial identifications of different types of mixed young people in Britain. I find that the meanings and significance of race and mixedness in these young people’s lives can vary considerably both across and within specific mixed groups. In conclusion, I argue that while there is evidence of a growing consciousness and interest in being mixed, we cannot (yet) speak of a coherent mixed group or experience in Britain.

Abstract = {This study explored influences on racial identity of mixed race youth who identified themselves to be part of mixed African (Black) and European (White) origin. Research questions emerged following a review of the literature identifying the ways in which views of self, family, peers and society impact youth and their racial identification. Eight in-depth interviews employing the Long Interview Method were conducted, transcribed and coded to determine themes. Family influences emerged as playing a significant role in biracial identity formation. Three major themes were identified: (1) level of parental awareness and understanding of race issues; (2) impact of family structure; and (3) communication and willingness to talk about race issues. Implications for researchers and social work practitioners working with this population are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Youths growing up in low-income inner-city neighborhoods are at substantial risk for initiating substance use, violent behavior, and sexual intercourse at early ages; these risk behaviors continue at comparatively high rates through adolescence. Hopelessness has been implicated as a risk factor for these behaviors. In this paper, we consider how race influences this process. African Americans form a demographic minority within the United States, but they are often the majority within inner-city neighborhoods. For Caucasians, the opposite typically holds. Mixed-race populations form a minority within both contexts. Using longitudinal data, we examine the relationship between race and risk behaviors in several impoverished inner-city neighborhoods where African Americans form the distinct majority and Caucasians and people of mixed racial heritage form a small minority. We also consider how race moderates the relationship between hopelessness and risk behavior. Our findings show that compared to Caucasian or mixed-race adolescents, African American adolescents are less likely to engage in risk behaviors, and that hopelessness has a less important impact on their behaviors.

Abstract = {‘Mixed’ people comprise one of the fastest growing populations in Britain today, and their growth refutes the idea that there exist distinct, ‘natural’ races among people in multiethnic societies, such as Britain. In recent years, a large body of scholarship, both in the US and Britain, has begun to investigate the diverse social experiences and racial identifications of mixed people. In this article, I investigate the ways in which mixed siblings perceive and think about race and differences in racial, ethnic, and religious identification within their families. What role do race and the recognition of difference play in sibling relationships and in family life more generally? I draw upon a small number of cases to illustrate the diverse ways in which understandings of race, ethnicity, and religion are (or are not) regarded as important in these families. I also consider whether there are group differences in terms of how disparate types of mixed siblings may perceive pressures to identify in particular ways.

Abstract = {This article examines how discourses of linguistic (in)competency regiment productions of citizenship in the South Korean popular media. Through an analysis of newspaper articles and television programs, we investigate how depictions of language competency become key resources for locating individuals within genealogies of kinship and chronotopic figures of personhood. In some cases, the speech of these celebrities associates them with imaginings of their backwards, low-class Korean kin, the Japanese colonial period, and American military presence, while in other cases, their language is associated with the 21st-century ideal of the modern, elite, globetrotting neoliberal subject. This analysis demonstrates how competence is read in relation to changing notions of citizenship in the new ‘multicultural’ Korea as these men are differentially positioned between multiple raced, classed, and gendered imaginings of Whiteness and Koreanness. More generally, we argue that understandings of linguistic competence are social productions, rather than reflections of language ability.

Abstract = {Theorizing on segmented assimilation has usefully spurred debate about the experiences and positions of the second generation in the US and, more recently, Europe. This theory has focused primarily on how young people fare in secondary school and the crucial role that families and ethnic social networks can play in supporting second-generation individuals. But what happens when young people leave home and enter into mainstream higher education institutions? Theorizing on segmented assimilation does not address either the implications of intermarriage for integration and upward mobility or how we should conceptualize the experiences of the growing numbers of ‘mixed race’ individuals. In this paper, I first consider the question of whether intermarriage is linked with upward mobility in the British context. I then explore the racial identifications and experiences of disparate types of mixed race young people in Britain. How do such young people identify themselves, and what may their identifications reveal about their sense of belonging in Britain? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In the United States, mixed-race people must either deny their multiracial identity by identifying with only a single race or create an identity that is not recognized or validated by the broader society. Consequently, the core issue facing mixed-race people is how to identify racially and manage the assortment of dynamics, dilemmas, and challenges associated with racial identification in a society that denies and devalues multiracial identity. This chapter examined several family dynamics that commonly undermine or compromise how mixed-race children explore, define, assert, and negotiate their racial identities. Strategies for intervention were presented, including how to support parents in teaching their children how to understand and manage encounters with racism.

Abstract = {Despite the often cited idea that racial identities are socially constructed, and potentially fluid, much public policy is still based on surveys that elicit only one measure of racial identity. A number of U.S. studies have employed “best single race” questions on racial identification, in which multiracial respondents are asked to choose only one race to describe themselves. We extend some American studies by examining responses to a “best single race” survey question posed to a small sample of multiracial young people in Britain. In-depth interviews with British multiracial respondents are employed to investigate the extent to which a “best single race” (BSR) question captures someone’s sense of attachment and belonging to a particular ethnic or racial group. In particular, we focus on how we should interpret East Asian/white respondents’ choice of “white” as their BSR. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {People perceive and evaluate others according to social categories. Yet social perception is complicated by the fact that people have multiple social identities, and self-categorization with these identities shifts from one situation to another. Two experiments examined whether self-categorization with a novel mixed-race group would override automatic racial bias. Participants assigned to a mixed-race group had more positive automatic evaluations of Black ingroup than Black outgroup members. Comparing these evaluations to Black and White faces unaffiliated with either group indicated this preference was driven by ingroup bias rather than outgroup derogation. Moreover, both outgroup and unaffiliated faces elicited automatic racial bias (White > Black), suggesting that automatic evaluations are sensitive to both the current intergroup context (positive evaluations of novel ingroup members) and race (racial bias toward outgroup and unaffiliated faces). These experiments provide evidence that self-categorization can override automatic racial bias and that automatic evaluations shift between and within social contexts.

Abstract = {The author uses contemporary psychoanalytic theory in further understanding the negotiation of conflict and dissociation in biracial patients who are both African-American and White. Drawing on the work of contemporary theorists who have made efforts to navigate the relationship between inner and outer worlds in our understanding of race from a psychoanalytic perspective, the author examines the relationship between race, culture, and internalized self-other relations—how they interact with each other and impact splitting and dissociative processes among self-states. The author argues for a notion of the unconscious as one that contains historical trauma related to race relations that influences the developing capacity to sustain internal conflict between opposing self-states borne out of this trauma. The author shows how society works against the integration of racialized self-states and interferes with the capacity to contain conflict. Through an extended clinical vignette from an analysis of a mixed-race patient, the author looks at the interplay of self-states between a White analyst (author) and a mixed-race patient (African-American and White) as manifested through a series of enactments and the unconscious “mating” between dissociated self-states in both patient and analyst. The author argues that the analyst's engagement of his or her own dissociated self-states and containment of internal conflict is critical to aiding the patient in moving toward greater integration.

Abstract = {Norms determine regular patterns of behavior and influence members' identification with a group. They are also a proximate way to predict and understand behavior in diverse work groups but, surprisingly, have not been extensively examined in this context. After reviewing research on group norms and the psychology of prejudice, I suggest that reaping the benefits of the increased range of available task relevant resources in demographically diverse work groups may depend on the strength and content of the norms it adopts, but that diverse groups face distinct obstacles in developing strong norms that create satisfying interpersonal interaction and effective work performance. I consider the difficulties diverse work groups have in forming strong norms and then focus on how anti‐bias norms, which are directed toward preventing behaviors associated with prejudice and discrimination and address members' security concerns, and openness norms, which promote people's ability to individuate those whom they might otherwise stereotype as well as address nurturance concerns, may increase a work group's ability to optimize social interaction and performance amidst diversity. I suggest that reorienting psychological and organizational research on prejudice to focus on group norm strength and content may be a way of both understanding and solving the greater challenges of discrimination.

A structural path model was created which best explains the linkages between race/ethnicity and our new construct “Total Social Capital.” The CFA confirmed the three very distinct dimensions of social capital: parent–school, parent–parent, and parent–child. Fit indices also suggest the existence of a second order, global Total Social Capital factor comprised of all three dimensions of social capital. We show that Black, Hispanic, and mixed-race family status is associated with significantly diminished Total Social Capital, both directly and indirectly via socioeconomic status. This is one of the few studies to find decreased social capital even among middle- and upper-middle-class minorities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

The cultural initiatives involve identity politics that strive to rescue identities from distortion and erasure by the dominant society; the political initiatives seek to reorganize and redistribute resources, and have called upon the state to play a key role. This chapter examines these racial projects as they relate to the intersection of Black and multiracial identity politics and the politics of collecting racial data as in the census and affirmative action. In order to achieve their objectives, these projects have engaged in what racial formation theory defines as re-articulation.

Abstract = {Estimates of around 1.7-2.4% of the population in the USA, 2% in Canada, and 0.6% in Britain now self-identify as mixed race. Inter-ethnic unions comprise around 2.7% of all unions in the USA and 1.3% in Britain and are increasing. The impact of these changes on the ethnic/racial diversity of Britain and North America and the demand from persons of mixed race to describe their 'full' identity requires a response from government and Census agencies that classify the population by race/ethnicity. Research show that the self-understandings of persons of mixed race may incorporate a range of identities, some biracial and others a single group like 'black', although the options available in the USA may still be limited by the legacy of the hypodescent policy. The solutions offered by classifications in the 2000/2001 round of censuses include a subdivided 'mixed' category in England and Wales and provision to select one or more categories in the USA. This marks an end to the official conceptualisation of 'pure' races that has been so pervasive in the past and, for the first time, offers mixed race identity to those of mixed heritage.

Abstract = {Feminist researchers have urged more study of how feminist practice is actually accomplished in mixed-gender organizations. Social movement scholars have called for more attention to dynamics of gender and race in social movement organizations, especially to the challenges of maintaining internal solidarity. Based on field observations in a pro-feminist, progressive, mixed-gender, mixed-race social movement organization, this article examines organizational decision-making processes and interpersonal and group dynamics. From February 1990 to May 1992, the author attended meetings; conducted 40 in-depth interviews with board members, staff and donors; and innumerable informal conversations; and reviewed documents back to 1974. The data was reviewed for themes and patterns. Gendered and racialized patterns of subordination are both very much in evidence and, at the same time, actively challenged in this organization. The author argues that pro-feminist and progressive organizational practices and efforts to create solidarity across gender and race can exist through competing and contradictory dynamics and ongoing struggles. Complex and inconsistent dynamics around these social barriers are likely to occur in organizations more generally and need to be a subject for more research.

Abstract = {In this article, a nationally-representative sample of kindergarten-aged children is used from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to explore the structure of parental racial designation of mixed-race children. The variation in these parental designations of a variety of mixed-race children is described. Parental racial designations in the three most common majority-minority interracial couplings - White/Hispanic, Black/White and Asian/White - are predicted using multinomial logistic regression models. The results may indicate a movement by the parents of these multiracial children away from minority status through racial labeling and towards "multiracial" and "White" - movements that are predicated upon gender, class and context. Critical discussions of the implications of these results as well as directions for future research are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This paper examines the ways 'mixed race' women in Canada contemplate their relationship to national identity. Through qualitative, open-ended interviews with 24 women identified as 'mixed race' (aged 20-55 yrs), the research demonstrates how some women of 'mixed race' contest ideas of the nation as constituted through the policy of multiculturalism in Canada. To challenge the tropes of the national narrative, some women of 'mixed race' develop nuanced models of cultural citizenship, illustrating that national identities are formed and transformed in relation to representation. Refusing to be positioned outside the nation, they effectively produce their own meanings of identity by working through their own personally identified 'mixed race' bodies to the national body politic, where some of them see their own bodies as intrinsically 'multicultural'. The paper ends by addressing the paradoxes of multiculturalism, emphasising through narratives that the policy produces hierarchical spaces against which some 'mixed race' women imaginatively negotiate, contest and challenge perceptions of their racialised and gendered selves.

Abstract = {Averaged face composites, which represent the central tendency of a familiar population of faces, are attractive. If this prototypicality contributes to their appeal, then averaged composites should be more attractive when their component faces come from a familiar, own-race population than when they come from a less familiar, other-race population. We compared the attractiveness of own-race composites, other-race composites, and mixed-race composites (where the component faces were from both races). In experiment 1, Caucasian participants rated own-race composites as more attractive than other-race composites, but only for male faces. However, mixed-race (Caucasian/Japanese) composites were significantly more attractive than own-race composites, particularly for the opposite sex. In experiment 2, Caucasian and Japanese participants living in Australia and Japan, respectively, selected the most attractive face from a continuum with exaggerated Caucasian characteristics at one end and exaggerated Japanese characteristics at the other, with intervening images including a Caucasian averaged composite, a mixed-race averaged composite, and a Japanese averaged composite. The most attractive face was, again, a mixed-race composite, for both Caucasian and Japanese participants. In experiment 3, Caucasian participants rated individual Eurasian faces as significantly more attractive than either Caucasian or Asian faces. Similar results were obtained with composites. Eurasian faces and composites were also rated as healthier than Caucasian or Asian faces and composites, respectively. These results suggest that signs of health may be more important than prototypicality in making average faces attractive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Explains the reversal of the racial mixing problem as well as the identity work of women as they rearticulate the meaning of race and racial belonging within dominant racial logic. The identification of macro constraints and the illustration of individual agency in the negotiation of identity extends the symbolic interactionist perspective on identity formation. The author captures the micro level social process of racial formation through an analysis of women's ability to rearticulate the meaning of stigma. This research also adds to the symbolic interactionist literature that emphasizes face-to-face interaction, the micro processes, in the construction of self by revealing the dynamic interplay between macro and micro processes in the development of racial identity. The date used are drawn from a larger study that examines the racial and gendered identity constructions of 27 mixed-race women living in the US. The women in this study reject dominant patterns of stigma by reassigning stigma to their European ancestry. Given this reversal, women articulate and embrace non-white identities.

The purpose of the book is "to capture the phenomenology of being mixed-race in a compelling way, and in so doing to inspire, engage, and move our readers". The edited book contains 12 narratives written by self-identified multiracial students: six men and six women, either current students or recent graduates of Dartmouth College.

Academic problematization is the process by which groups or individuals are made into a problem. Historically women, various "races," gay men and lesbians, mentally ill persons, and other groups have been transformed into problems in the human sciences. Analyses of problematization seek to reconstruct when, why, and how a particular problematization took place, but the focus of this chapter will be on the "how"--that is, the techniques of problematization. The chapter will not answer exactly when hybridity became a problem in the course of Western history or how the discourses on hybridity as a biological, psychological, cultural, and political problem shifted over time. Instead, I am more interested in the conceptual and empiricist techniques that were construed, used, and repeated to make hybridity a problem. I hope to provide some understanding by tracing a few of these techniques from the Enlightenment to the present. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {In many respects, issues surrounding 'mixed-race' identities rupture and dislocate much current thinking within post-race and new ethnicities paradigms. This article seeks to critically engage with what is arguably a marginalized and diverse 'community'. An evaluation of theories emanating from the UK and USA seeks to challenge hybrid degenerative theories, and more recent attempts at explaining how such identities are negotiated in complex social arenas. What emerges is that some theories are underpinned by static and linear behavioural patterns, which appear oversimplified. Key questions are raised in order to further explore whether 'mixed-race' identities are genuinely marginalized and remain ambiguous in a range of physical, social, emotional and ideological contexts. Reflecting upon such issues seeks to prompt questions as to whether there can be a more sophisticated and sensitive understanding of the unique experiences (both positive and negative) of 'mixed-race' individuals. By doing so, it is hoped that such a topic becomes more central to considerations of how prejudice and discrimination operate across and within a wide variety of settings.

Abstract = {The author uses the term "mixed race" mindfully, aware that the term is contested by some, while others warn against its reference to the unscientific non-sense of "race". Therefore, for the purposes of this article only, she defines "mixed race" people as the offspring of one white and one non-white parent. Concentrating on the visual, this article intends to use the figure of the mixed "race" subject to investigate the particular scopic regime of whiteness. The author considers some of the things that the dominant scopic regime accords visibility to, and some of those it does not. Clearly, what ends up being seen and the various interpretations then afforded depend largely on cultural registers, power relations, and epistemologies that continually shift. This article intends to foreground a tricky kind of whiteness that is notable for its almost complete invisibility--the whiteness of the mixed "race" subject. By way of a focus on the ocular, the author suggests that the subject with an identifiably mixed "race" phenotype poses some quite specific threats to some of whiteness's most cherished understandings of itself. Potentially, the mixed "race" subject put the category of whiteness into question (if not crisis). In order to tease out some of these problems, the author uses examples from a recent body of her own visual art work (Morrison, 2002). Carlton Johnson: My 'Life', centers around the experiences of a late-teenage boy of mixed "race" living in an all-white region of Britain in the late 1970s. Through the "mixed" media of comic strip, video, "historical" reconstruction and diary entries, Carlton attempts to tell his story and negotiate his conflicting feelings about the importance others seem to place on his skin. The author also uses some other examples of visual art that raises questions about mixed "race" identity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{2014-23634-00720140601,
Abstract = {Background/Context: Cuba’s education system has been the focus of academic study by researchers on and off the island who frequently cite the comparative success of Cuban students on measures such as the UNESCO math and language assessments. Few studies, however, consider the significance of race within Cuban education generally or the home–school relationship in particular. Indeed, there has been no empirical work made available on these topics for nearly a decade. Significant sociopolitical changes are underway in Cuba, with implications for the role of the state in the cultural life of the nation. Education is a key transmission point between the state and its people, with teachers as frontline cultural workers. Purpose: This article examines the way Cuban teachers address racism in their professional practice, with a specific focus on teacher home visits to address racism with parents/guardians. The author analyzes the relationship between Cuban teachers and the families of students they teach (an under-researched form of teacher practice in an under-researched context). Little is known about teachers reaching and teaching parents directly about issues such as racism. Further, there is limited research on the ways in which understanding of citizenship and professional responsibility impact teachers’ work and pedagogy in their interactions with parents. Setting: Havana, Cuba. Participants: All interviewees were teachers from downtown Havana. Twenty-two male and 23 female teachers participated. Fifteen of the teachers were Mestizo (of mixed race), one was Chinese-Cuban, 21 were Afro-Cuban, and eight were White. Survey participants were drawn from across Havana’s 15 boroughs. Among respondents, 67.4% were female and 32.6% were male. As far as race, 57.8% identified as Mestizo, 18.9% identified as Afro-Cuban, 22% identified as White, and 1.3% identified as Chinese. Research Design: This is a mixed-method study using qualitative interviews (N = 45 participants), and a quantitative survey (N = 150 respondents). Conclusions/Recommendations: Teachers regularly enter the homes of parents in an effort to promote diversity and to counter perceived racism among parents/guardians. The fact that teachers have the authority and sense of entitlement to do so points to possibilities for a significant retooling of the ecology systems framework. Many teachers undertake this work with parents/guardians just as they would when addressing student academic performance. This race-work is supported by state-generated social capital that, in Cuba, embeds conceptions of race within a larger public context, as opposed to treating race as a private matter to be subjectively and privately understood. As quasi-curriculum, antiracism is something everyone is expected to learn. This suggests that a careful consideration of the way concepts of nation, citizenship, and professional responsibility inform teacher preparation and practice in Cuba may deepen our understanding of teachers’ race-work in North American contexts.

Abstract = {Objective: We use nationally representative survey experiments to assess public opinion about how President Obama should have identified himself racially on the 2010 Census. Methods: Respondents were randomly assigned to three conditions—a control, a treatment that described the president’s biracial ancestry, and a treatment that combined the biracial ancestry information with a statement that Obama had in fact classified himself as black only. All respondents were then asked how they felt Obama should have filled out his Census form. Results. A clear majority of Americans in all experimental conditions said that Obama should have identified himself as both black and white. Conclusion: There appears to be suggesting robust acceptance of official multiracial identification despite the cultural and legal legacy of the “one drop of blood” rule in official U.S. race categorization. A subsequent survey experiment found that a convenience sample of Americans support multiracial identification for mixed-race individuals generally and not only for the president.

Results show that African-American subjects(Ss) reported lower birth weight, lower verbal IQ, and higher number of sexual partners than did White Ss. For each characteristic, the mean of mixed-race Ss fell between the means of the 2 other populations. Birth weights were heavier as social class increased. In African-American Ss, the number of sexual partners was not associated with social class; those associations were weak in White Ss. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the significance of ancestry on racial identity and its influence on healthcare. 20 individuals of mixed African-American-White and Asian-American-White ancestries (aged 45-94 yrs) completed interviews concerning self-identity. Results show that racial identity included the 5 dimensions of cultural identity, ascribed racial identity, racial identification to others, racial self-identification, and situational racialization of feeling. Mixed African-Americans described greater consistency in ascribed racial identity and a consistency between ascribed racial identity and racial identification to others. Mixed Asian-American subjects appeared to be less restricted by racial definitions. Findings suggest that the assessment of health care needs should not be based on narrow definitions of race.

Abstract = {The aim was to investigate ethnic differences in lifetime self-harm and attempted suicide in women prisoners, and to examine relationships between self-harm, suicide and substance use on dependence. Subjects included 301 women in ten prisons from different parts of England. Half of the women in the sample reported at least one act of self-harm in their life and 46% reported making a suicide attempt at some time. Lifetime self-harm was associated with a history of harmful drinking and with being a victim of violence, including physical assault, sexual assault and violence from family and friends. Lifetime suicide attempts were associated with reported violence from family or friends. Current high suicide risk was most common among women on remand. Drug dependence and reported violence from family or friends were both more common amongst white women than black/mixed race women. Self-harm and attempted suicide were generally more common among white women, but black/mixed race women dependent on drugs had the highest proportion of women reporting self-harm. There was tentative support for a three-way association between ethnicity, dependence and self-harm; this raises the possibility that drug dependence may be a predictor of self-harm in the black female prison population.

Abstract = {The Integrative Model for the Study of Developmental Competencies in Minority Children argues that while discrimination and prejudice are normative experiences for ethnic minority children, promoting environments, family factors and adaptive culture may help minority youth develop effective coping strategies to deal with discrimination. Although this model emphasizes the critical role of family, there are relatively few studies on discrimination that include data from both parents and youth. In the current study, we qualitatively investigated themes of teen discrimination experiences and youth/parent responses in a sample (N = 40) of Mexican descent parents (n = 20) and middle school aged (11–15 years old) adolescents (n = 20) who participated in separate youth and parent focus groups. Adolescents indicate that stereotypes are pervasive, as evidenced in media, anti-immigrant comments, and insults from peers. Yet, adolescents expressed few specific strategies to deal with discrimination, and often expressed concern that standing up to discrimination may lead to physical altercation. Parents discussed the pervasiveness of prejudice and ethnic slurs, and specifically identified school as a setting where teens experience discrimination. Parents discussed strategies of teaching children not to use derogatory terms against others, telling them not to engage in fighting, encouraging children to report school incidents to teachers, and trying to prevent criminalization of male youth by talking to them about clothing choices. Mixed race families especially talked about inclusivity, ethnic/racial pride, and sharing family history (immigration, language, racial diversity). The Integrative Model for Developmental Competencies guides our discussion of implications for adolescent well-being and future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {When the economy declines, racial minorities are hit the hardest. Although existing explanations for this effect focus on institutional causes, recent psychological findings suggest that scarcity may also alter perceptions of race in ways that exacerbate discrimination. We tested the hypothesis that economic resource scarcity causes decision makers to perceive African Americans as “Blacker” and that this visual distortion elicits disparities in the allocation of resources. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that scarcity altered perceptions of race, lowering subjects’ psychophysical threshold for seeing a mixed-race face as “Black” as opposed to “White.” In studies 3 and 4, scarcity led subjects to visualize African American faces as darker and more “stereotypically Black,” compared with a control condition. When presented to naïve subjects, face representations produced under scarcity elicited smaller allocations than control-condition representations. Together, these findings introduce a novel perceptual account for the proliferation of racial disparities under economic scarcity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {People perceive and evaluate others on the basis of social categories, such as race, gender and age. Initial processing of targets in terms of visually salient social categories is often characterized as inevitable. In the current study, we investigated the influence of processing goals on the representation of race in the visual processing stream. Participants were assigned to one of two mixed-race teams and categorized faces according to their group membership or skin color. To assess neural representations of race, we employed multivariate pattern analysis to examined neural activity related to the presentation of Black and White faces. As predicted, patterns of neural activity within the early visual cortex and fusiform gyri (FG) could decode the race of face stimuli above chance and were moderated by processing goals. Race decoding in early visual cortex was above chance in both categorization tasks and below chance in a prefrontal control region.

The results suggest that, ironically, explicit racial categorization can diminish the representation of race in the FG.

Abstract = {Drawing on Kanter's (1977) observations and assertions, this study employs a structural approach to examine the influence of group racial composition on the behavior of group members. To be specific, this study assesses the effects of proportional representation on the behavior of 90 Asian group members who were assigned to one of three types of groups: all-Asian groups, Asian-Caucasian balanced groups, and Caucasian-dominated groups. Groups were assigned the task of discussing and generating a solution for a managerial case scenario. The discussions were videotaped and viewed by independent judges who evaluated patterns of intragroup behavior including levels of participation and leadership behavior among group members. The findings suggest that proportional representation can act as a significant source of influence on behavior of group members. We conclude this article with a discussion of the implications of these findings from both a practical and theoretical perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Several theories suggest that people do not represent race when it does not signify group boundaries. However, race is often associated with visually salient differences in skin tone and facial features. In this study, we investigated whether race could be decoded from distributed patterns of neural activity in the fusiform gyri and early visual cortex when visual features that often covary with race were orthogonal to group membership. To this end, we used multivariate pattern analysis to examine an fMRI dataset that was collected while participants assigned to mixed-race groups categorized own-race and other-race faces as belonging to their newly assigned group. Whereas conventional univariate analyses provided no evidence of race-based responses in the fusiform gyri or early visual cortex, multivariate pattern analysis suggested that race was represented within these regions. Moreover, race was represented in the fusiform gyri to a greater extent than early visual cortex, suggesting that the fusiform gyri results do not merely reflect low-level perceptual information (e.g. color, contrast) from early visual cortex. These findings indicate that patterns of activation within specific regions of the visual cortex may represent race even when overall activation in these regions is not driven by racial information.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Articulate While Black: Barack Obama, Language, and Race in the US by H. Samy Alim and G. Smitherman (2012). In the present book, Alim and Smitherman continue to stay true to the language game by decoding the “racially coded meanings of articulate and how they function to reproduce racist ideologies and, more importantly, racial inequalities”. Using a critical linguistics approach, the authors look at patterns of speech, analyze the syntax of White and Black discourse, and observe how the regular and patterned use of adjectives accompanying articulate indicate the racist subtext of what on the surface may appear to be praise, but what smacks of White racist paternalism, particularly when used by White speakers towards speakers of color. The chapters provide the larger ongoing social, historical, and political processes contributing to the racially coded meanings of articulate. The book is just as much about Obama’s walking the line of linguistic versatility and subsequent ascent to the presidency as it is about America’s attitude towards African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and African American culture. The book outline the contours of Obama’s rhetorical style: his blending of the sacred and the profane and his ability to analyze his mixed-race audience and select “a familiar cultural touchstone” such as the jeremiad, which speaks to Americans’ “shared values embodied in the American Dream”.

American Mixed Race: The Culture of Microdiversity (see record [rid]1995-97907-000[/rid]), edited by Naomi Zack, probes this problem of the color line from the perspective of racial diversity within individuals. The book argues that discussions of diversity (i.e., racial difference, multiculturalism) tend to focus on rigidly defined racial categories that impose group membership for individuals who differ from others in those groups and who may not belong to, or identify with, any particular group. The important contributions of American Mixed Race are twofold. First, the book is multidisciplinary. Contributors represent a number of specialties within the social sciences and humanities. The five sections of the book are autobiography, art, social science, public policy, and identity theory. Second, the book demonstrates the breadth of the microdiversity concept. Although racial distinctions will remain salient within the broader social culture well into the 21st century, the real challenge is recognizing and appreciating the commonalities within human experiences.

Abstract = {What factors determine whether mixed-race individuals claim a biracial identity or a monoracial identity? Two studies examine how two status-related factors—race and social class—influence identity choice. While a majority of mixed-race participants identified as biracial in both studies, those who were members of groups with higher status in American society were more likely than those who were members of groups with lower status to claim a biracial identity. Specifically, (a) Asian/White individuals were more likely than Black/White or Latino/White individuals to identify as biracial and (b) mixed-race people from middle-class backgrounds were more likely than those from working-class backgrounds to identify as biracial. These results suggest that claiming a biracial identity is a choice that is more available to those with higher status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

In sociological literature of the UK and US, mixed-race people have often been described as occupying a marginal or in-between position from which they can only escape by adopting full membership in 1 group or the other. However, some sociologists suggest that it is possible for mixed-race people to steer a successful course between the 2 groups or to alter their racial self-image according to circumstance; ethnic identity is considered to be more fluid and dynamic than is frequently depicted. It is suggested that the dichotomous Black or White model of racial identity stems from analysis of the US racial structure, but investigation of racial identity in the UK requires a more flexible view of the racial categorization system.

We examined perceived CU norms and their association with CU and CU disorder (CUD) for White, Black, Hispanic, Native-American, Asian-American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NH/PI), and mixed-race adolescents. Data were from adolescents (12–17 years) in the 2004–2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (N = 163,837). Substance use and CUD were assessed by computer-assisted, self-interviewing methods. Blacks, Hispanics, Native-Americans, and mixed-race adolescents had greater odds of past-year CU and CUD than Whites. Among past-year cannabis users (CUs), Hispanics and Native-Americans had greater odds of having a CUD than Whites. Asian-Americans had the highest prevalence of perceived parental or close friends' CU disapproval. Native-Americans and mixed-race adolescents had lower odds than Whites of perceiving CU disapproval from parents or close friends. In adjusted analyses, adolescent's disapproval of CU, as well as perceived disapproval by parents or close friends, were associated with a decreased odds of CU in each racial/ethnic group, except for NHs/PIs. Adolescent's disapproval of CU was associated with a decreased odds of CUD among CUs for Whites (personal, parental, and close friends' disapproval), Hispanics (personal, parental, and close friends' disapproval), and mixed-race adolescents (personal, close friends' disapproval). Racial/ethnic differences in adolescent CU prevalence were somewhat consistent with adolescents' reports of CU norm patterns. Longitudinal research on CU health effects should oversample nonwhite adolescents to assure an adequate sample for analysis and reporting.

Abstract = {The relation between multiracial identity selection and psychological outcomes related to the self and well-being was explored among minority/White biracials spanning four different mixed-race groups (n = 201): Black/Whites, East Asian/Whites, Latino/Whites, and South Asian/Whites. The mixed-race groups showed considerable variability in their selection of multiracial identity categories and different patterns of identity selection, as well as a higher overall representation of transcendent identity (i.e., identity that challenges traditional notions of race) than reported in previously published studies. Our findings demonstrated that biracial identity selection, especially when differentiating between identities that are socially validated or not socially validated by others, was related to a person's level of multiracial identity integration, identification with Whites, perceived discrimination from Whites and non-Whites, and psychological well-being. Identity selection groups did not significantly differ from each other in levels of self-concept clarity or identification with their non-White racial group. Theoretical implications for extending a multidimensional model to other mixed-race groups and redefining race as a social and cultural construction are discussed.

Abstract = {There is a growing number of mixed-race people in the United States and a growing number of individuals who identify as mixed-race or multiracial. In the last census, 6.8 million people identified as multiracial, marking more than one racial category to identify themselves or their children, with 42 percent under 18 years of age (Jones & Symens Smith, 2001). The "biracial baby boom" of the 1970s and 1980s produced a notable cohort of multiracial individuals (Bratter, 2007) and resulted in an increase in the number of mixed-race individuals from 500,000 in 1970 to nearly 7 million in 2000 (Krebs, 2000; Shih & Sanchez, 2005). Given this growing population, mental health practitioners will likely be working with increasing numbers of multiracial individuals (Kerwin, Ponterotto, Jackson, & Harris, 1993); thus, it is important for therapists and counselors to have an awareness and knowledge of the experiences of this population and to be able to transfer this awareness and knowledge into skills useful in working with multiracial individuals. Competent, ethical multicultural practice requires understanding and addressing the unique characteristics and mental health needs of this population. This chapter will provide the reader with guidelines and resources for increasing awareness of one's own values and attitudes, knowledge of ecological issues related to people of mixed ancestry, and skills in developing competency in working with persons of mixed ancestry. Case studies are included and will be referred to throughout the chapter to illustrate critical concepts. Pouse & Ponder exercises will be included throughout the chapter to prompt the reader to stop, reflect, and engage in a more contemplative and dynamic way with the concepts in this text, thus increasing personal awareness and recognition of multicultural issues as they relate to people of mixed ancestry (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Group drug counseling is the primary treatment modality used to treat drug dependence in community settings in the United States. Findings from the social psychology literature suggest that gender may influence how individuals participate in groups, and that race may moderate the effects of gender on group behavior. This study examined gender, race, and their interaction as predictors of alliance, participation, self-disclosure, and receipt of advice and feedback in drug counseling groups, and explored how gender and racial differences in drug counseling group behavior related to outcome of cocaine dependence treatment. Method: Ratings of group behavior were made from videotaped sessions of group drug counseling drawn from a randomized trial of treatment for cocaine-dependent individuals (n = 438). Analyses examined the effects of race (African American or non-Hispanic White), gender, and the race by gender interaction on group behavior. Additional analyses examined race, gender, and group behavior, and interactions among these variables in predicting monthly cocaine use. Results: Race and the race by gender interaction, but not gender alone, predicted many group behaviors. Non-Hispanic White women had the highest rates of self-disclosure and receipt of advice and non-positive feedback, followed by men of both races, with African American women having the lowest levels. These differences were unrelated to cross-sectional cocaine outcome. Conclusions: Women, but not men, of different races acted differently in mixed-race, mixed-gender cocaine treatment groups, with African American women exhibiting less of several behaviors. Additional research on causes and consequences of these differences could inform interventions for drug-dependent women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Models of face perception often adopt a framework in which faces are represented as points or vectors in a multidimensional space, relative to the average face that serves as a norm for encoding. Since faces are very similar in their configuration and share many visual properties, they could be encoded in one common space against one norm. However, certain face properties may result in grouping and “subclassification” of similar faces. We studied the processing of faces of different races, using high-level aftereffects, where exposure to one face systematically distorts the perception of a subsequently viewed face toward the “opposite” identity in face space. We measured identity aftereffects for adapt–test pairs that were opposite relative to race-specific (Asian and Caucasian) averages and pairs that were opposite relative to a “generic” average (both races morphed together). Aftereffects were larger for race-specific compared to mixed-race adapt–test pairs. These results suggest that race-specific norms are used to code identity because aftereffects are generally larger for adapt–test pairs drawn from trajectories passing through the norm (opposite pairs) than for those that do not. We also found that identification thresholds were lower when targets were distributed around race-specific averages than around the mixed-race average, suggesting that norm-based face encoding may play a functional role in facilitating identity discrimination.

Abstract = {America has been the breeding ground of a "biracial baby boom" for the past 25 years. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of information regarding how racially mixed people identify and view themselves and how they relate to one another. "Racially Mixed People in America" steadily bridges this gap, and offers a comprehensive look at the social and psychological adjustment of multiracial people, models for identity development, contemporary immigration and marriage patterns, and methodological issues involved in conducting research with mixed-race people, all in the context of America's multiracial past and present. Including contributions by ethnohistorians, psychologists, and sociologists, this powerful volume will provide the reader a tool for examining ideologies surrounding race, race relations, and the role of social science in the deconstruction of race.  "Racially Mixed People in America" is essential reading for researchers and practitioners in cross-cultural studies, psychology, family studies, sociology, and social work.

Abstract = {Two important new books by Greg Carter and Kenneth Prewitt provide detailed historical perspectives on how understandings of race and race categories have evolved since the founding of the republic. Prewitt focuses on an analysis of racial classification in the US census—the so-called ‘statistical races’ –and its changing role in US policy, culminating in recommendations for radical change. Carter takes as his theme population mixing across the races, offering a positive, even celebratory, but little known account of the moments and movements that have praised mixing. As pressures mount on the ‘statistical races’ in the late twentieth century, Prewitt uses the political space opened up by these debates to offer fundamental changes to US methods of ethno-racial data collection, including the removal of these questions from the census.

A case example of a 7-yr-old boy with a White mother and a Black father shows the role of school social workers in assessing problems and assisting these children to develop positive racial self-concepts and successful school adjustment. Two basic processes involved in the development of racial identity are discussed—racial conception and racial evaluation. To promote prevention, school social workers should develop ways to identify students who are at-risk for racial-identity problems even before those problems may be manifested, and develop skills for assessing and intervening in family and organizational dynamics related to racial-identity issues.

Abstract = {This article examines the practice of marriage among whites, mestizos, blacks, Cubans, and Spaniards during the first constitutional era, focusing upon the reported ages of brides and grooms. The study consists of a quantitative examination of trends found in the records of 900 Catholic marriages celebrated in Havana during the opening decades of independence. The first major finding of the research is that according to most major indicators of status, age was negatively correlated with rank. Thus, contrary to the conclusions of studies conducted in many other contexts, those in the highest strata of society married younger. Furthermore, very significant differences were detected in the marital patterns of those identified as mixed-race and those labeled as black. This finding offers empirical weight to the notion that the early-mid twentieth-century Cuban racial structure would best be characterized as tripartite, rather than binary in nature.

Abstract = {Conducted 3 convergent studies to investigate the hypothesis that task-irrelevant status attributes of peers influence judgment of deservingness more for younger than for older children. In Study 1, 112 Black and White 1st and 3rd graders allocated rewards to peer pairs whose members were either both Black or both White. Allocations of 1st graders were more influenced by the player's race than were the 3rd graders'. In Study 2, 144 Black and White 1st and 3rd graders made allocations to pairs in which one partner was Black and the other White. Relative size and task performance were also varied. Player's race did not influence allocations, but relative size did. In Study 3, 68 Ss who had been 1st-grade Ss in Studies 1 or 2 were reassessed 4 yrs later. Also, 77 new 5th graders served as Ss. Allocations of younger Ss and of Ss who had been held back in elementary school were less task-based than those of older and promoted Ss. Results are discussed in terms of children's cognitive capacities, equity theory, status generalization, and the development of fair-play standards.

Abstract = {For me, one of the influential ideas within the original Milan approach to family therapy was coined by Shands (1971), who advocated that we should strive to "stamp out nouns", and I think this could not be more appropriate than it is in this potentially volatile field of race and culture. If we see race and culture as "nouns", that is, fixed entities with attached meanings; we lose the potential to see them as pauses in ongoing conversations (Krause, 2002). It would be helpful to see terms such as black, white, or mixed race as pauses or stopping points in ongoing conversations about race. The conversations take place in particular contexts containing elements of the past and the future, but if they can be constructed in a dialogical format they acquire the ability to change and develop new meanings. I think we have an ethical responsibility, if we choose to become engaged in this topic, to keep conversations going. So, the focus of this chapter is how to introduce the topic of race and culture into dialogical processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {Given the heightened risk for HIV and other STIs among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) as well as the racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/STI risk, an understanding of longitudinal trends in sexual behaviors is warranted as YMSM emerge into adulthood. Drawing from an ongoing prospective cohort study, the present analysis employed latent growth curve modeling to examine trends in distinct types of sexual activity without condoms over time in sample of YMSM and examine differences by race/ethnicity and perceived familial socioeconomic status (SES). Overall, White and Mixed race YMSM reported more instances of oral sex without condoms as compared to other racial/ethnic groups with rates of decline over time noted in Black YMSM. White YMSM also reported more receptive and insertive anal sex acts without a condom than Black YMSM. Declines over time in both types of anal sex acts without condoms among Black men were noted when compared to White men, while increases over time were noted for mixed race YMSM for condomless insertive anal sex. The effects for race/ethnicity were attenuated with the inclusion of perceived familial SES in these models. These findings build on previous cross sectional studies showing less frequent sex without condoms among Black YMSM despite higher rates of HIV incidence in emerging adulthood, as well as the importance of considering economic conditions in such models. Efforts to understand racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/STIs among YMSM must move beyond examination of individual-level sexual behaviors and consider both race/ethnicity and socioeconomic conditions in order to evaluate how these factors shape the sexual behaviors of YMSM.

Drawing on a nationally representative dataset that includes race questions in multiple formats, we evaluate how removal of the ‘brown’ category from the census or other social surveys would likely affect: (1) the descriptive picture of Brazil’s racial composition; and (2) estimates of income inequality between and within racial categories. We find that a forced binary question format results in a whiter and more racially unequal picture of Brazil through the movement of many higher income mixed-race respondents into the white category. We also find that regardless of question format, racial inequality in income accounts for relatively little of Brazil’s overall income inequality. We discuss implications for public policy debates in Brazil, and for the broader scientific and political challenges of ethnic and racial data collection and analysis.

Abstract = {Background/Context: One of the most critical functions of a well-integrated school is the development of “culturally flexible” students who, over the course of their social development, effectively navigate diverse social environs such as the workplace, communities, and neighborhoods. Most studies, albeit with some exceptions, have investigated the impact of desegregation on short- and long-term gains in achievement and attainment, as opposed to its impact on intergroup relations. Mixed-race schools are vital not only for bolstering achievement outcomes of previously disadvantaged students but also for promoting social cohesion in a diverse society. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Specifically, this article examines the difference in cultural flexibility between black and white students enrolled in schools with different racial and ethnic compositions. Cultural flexibility is defined as the propensity to value and move across different cultural and social peer groups and environments. Furthermore, this article provides some insight into how students in different mixed-race and desegregated educational contexts experience their school’s social organization and cultural environments, which influence their interactions and academic behaviors. Setting: The study was conducted over a 6-month period in four high schools: a majority-minority school and a majority-white school located in a northeastern city, and a majority-minority school and a majority-white school located in a southern city. Research Design: Survey data were gathered from a randomly stratified sample of 471 Black and White students attending. In addition, ethnographic notes from weeks of school observations and transcribed interview data from 57 group interviews conducted in the four schools with students in Grades 9–12 complemented the survey research. Data Collection and Analysis: Findings reveal significant associations among self-esteem, academic and extracurricular placement, and cultural flexibility for black students. Also, black students in majority-minority schools scored significantly higher on the cultural flexibility scale than those in majority-white schools. Among white students, regional location and academic placement showed statistically significant associations with cultural flexibility. The ethnographic and interview data further explicate why these patterns occurred and illuminate how certain school contextual factors are likely linked to students’ cultural flexibility. Overall, this study’s findings highlight some connections between student and school behaviors as they pertain to both students’ and educators’ willingness and ability to realize the visions of racial and ethnic integration wholly.

Abstract = {The growing presence and visibility of mixed race persons in the US demands that social workers critically examine and understand the complexity of multiracial identity. This qualitative investigation examined the narratives of ten multiracial adults about their identity experiences living as multiracial persons. Utilizing paradigmatic analysis of narratives, five major themes emerged. Four of these themes correspond to categories found in existing multiracial scholarship, and include: (1) Shifting racial/ethnic expressions; (2) Racial/ethnic ambiguity; (3) Feeling like an outsider; and (4) Seeking community. The final theme, (5) Racial resistance, contributes new knowledge to our understanding of how multiracial individuals respond to societal pressures to conform to traditional means of categorizing others by race. Findings from this study confirm a collective multiracial experience; one with direct ties to the social and environmental pressures associated with having a multifaceted identity in a color-conscious society.

The author uses the term "Eurafrican" and "Coloured" despite their historically controversial nature. Both terms are of historical and contemporary significance in Zambia. In contemporary Zambia the Eurafrican community is known as "Coloured." This concurs with the current application of "Coloured" as an ethnic identity and cultural classification characterized by Eurafricans' and so-called Indo-Africans' historical experiences of marginalization and alienation in colonial Zambia. The author also write and present firsthand autoethnographic accounts to reflect upon Eurafricans' marginalization and alienation in colonial Zambia, and their desire to be recognized as the legitimate descendants of British men, as well as to explore the ongoing legacies of these historical proceedings in Zambian Coloured people's contemporary political experiences and cultural practices. To better understand Zambian Coloured people's contemporary exclusion from Zambia's national census and appreciate their return migration to Britain, there is a need to examine British imperial procedures in colonial Zambia.

Abstract = {Substance use behaviors do not occur in isolation of one another and are not static over time. As adolescents age into early adulthood, there may be dynamic changes in their substance use behaviors, and these changes may be influenced by family and school factors. The current study uses Latent Transition Analysis to examine these changes by measuring transitions among different substance use profiles based on past 30-day alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use, and by estimating associations with demographic, family and school factors. Data were from youth (n = 850; 80 % African American, 17 % white, 3 % mixed race, 50 % female and 50 % male) in grade 10 (Time 1), with 24- (Time 2) and 48-month (Time 3) follow-ups. Substance use profiles included Non-users (54 %), Alcohol and Marijuana Users (20 %), and Alcohol, Tobacco and Marijuana Users (26 %). There were considerable transitions among profiles from Time 1 to Time 2, and fewer transitions from Time 2 to Time 3. At Time 1, African American race and positive school attitudes were negatively associated with being an Alcohol and Marijuana User, and being an Alcohol, Tobacco and Marijuana User. Family conflict, parental school involvement, female gender and African American race were associated with transitions among substance use profiles. Implications are discussed for a better understanding of transitions in substance use profiles, and for promoting maintenance of non-use and transitions from substance using profiles to non-use.

Abstract = {The present research capitalized on the prominence and multiracial heritage of U.S. 2008 presidential election candidate Barack Obama to examine whether individual differences in classifying him as Black or as multiracial corresponded to differences in implicit perception of race. This research used a newly developed task (Sedlins, Malahy, & Shoda, 2010) with digitally morphed mixed-race faces to assess implicit race perception. Participants completed this task four times before and one time after the election. We found that people who labeled Obama as Black implicitly perceived race as more categorical than those who labeled Obama as multiracial. This finding adds to the growing literature on multiracial perception by demonstrating a relationship between the explicit use of multiracial and monoracial race classification and implicit race perception. The results suggest potential implications for governmental, educational, and judiciary usage of racial categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Angela Onwuachi-Willig has written a compelling book about the significance that the Rhinelander v. Rhinelander annulment case has for modern day mixed-race families. It reads like two books in one, which if anything, allows it to bridge the stories of mixedrace families through time. Drawing upon evidence from the Rhinelander trial and other publicity regarding the case, she explains in part one, the pressures the parties were put through when they married across the color line. Ounwuachi-Willig offers an important discussion of modern anti-discrimination law in the housing and employment contexts, as she explains how each body of doctrine impacts where mixedrace families might live, and whether they might provide for their families. Yet, each type of anti-discrimination law has limitations in their ability to protect rights. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This article analyzes race-targeted policy in Brazil as both a political stake and a powerful instrument in an unfolding classificatory struggle over the definition of racial boundaries. The Brazilian state traditionally embraced mixed-race classification, but is adopting racial quotas employing a black/white scheme. To explore potential consequences of that turn for beneficiary identification and boundary formation, the author analyzes attitudinal survey data on race-targeted policy and racial classification in multiple formats, including classification in comparison to photographs. The results show that almost half of the mixed-race sample, when constrained to dichotomous classification, opts for whiteness, a majority rejects mixed-race individuals for quotas, and the mention of quotas for blacks in a split-ballot experiment nearly doubles the percentage choosing that racial category. Theories of how states make race emphasize the use of official categories to legislate exclusion. In contrast, analysis of the Brazilian case illuminates how states may also make race through policies of official inclusion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

The role of the mixed-race category as either a “buffer class” or a status threat depended on the class composition of whites. Black/mulatto occupational differentiation was greatest where whites had high occupational prestige and thus little to fear from a mulatto group. Furthermore, differentiation increased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively low status and decreased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively high status.

Abstract = {South Africa, a country that is highly stratified by race, is an important location for studying the relationship between race and educational expectations. Using a longitudinal data set, we examine the educational expectations of black (African), colored (mixed race), and white (European ancestry) parents and children in Cape Town, South Africa. We find that parents and children have high educational expectations regardless of race, but black parents and children have higher educational expectations than coloreds and whites once socioeconomic and other factors are controlled. We also find that parents' and children's expectations tend to agree more and are more closely correlated among coloreds and whites than blacks. We test two explanations for the educational expectations of parents and children, finding more support for the status attainment perspective among coloreds and whites than blacks and support for the family social capital perspective among blacks and coloreds only.

Abstract = {Within the Asian American narrative, one part that is regularly excluded is the story of mixed race Asian Americans. Despite the fact that mixed race Asians, also known as Hapas, make up 15% of the Asian American community and are one of the largest subgroups according to Pew Research Center, they have not been given an equal place in cultural organizations, community leadership, and academic research. According to Beverly Yuen Thompson (2000), "Within the 'Asian American experience' there is a great deal of diversity that has thus far remained unexplored. Issues of interracial relationships, transracial adoptions, biracial identity, and queer identity have remained marginalized and considered exceptions to an unspoken norm of Asian American identity". Since Asian Americans are defined by a monolithic term and are viewed by American society as a single entity, any deviations from this normative definition have been excluded. For many Hapa students in college, their cultural and racial differences have resulted in a general exclusion from Asian American and other single-race groups and harsher criticism under the model minority myth (MMM). Through a single, in-depth vignette, our chapter examines the influence of this exclusion and how the MMM operates to hamper student confidence and opportunities to connect with other students on campus, ultimately eroding the quality of the college experience. Additionally, it attempts to shine a light on the mixed race Asian American community and to make a case for why these stories are important in the overall landscape of educational research on Asian Americans and other non-dominant minority groups in general. A discussion of implications and recommendations for greater awareness and sensitivity to mixed-race students and their development in student programming and services as well as questions for further reflection follow. The following question guided our overall inquiry and analysis: What are the stories—perceived and experienced challenges—of those who identify as Hapa during college?

Abstract = {Introduction: Interest has increased in understanding the types and healthfulness of restaurant foods for children, particularly in disadvantaged areas. The purpose of this community-based participatory research study was to describe the quality of restaurant food offered to children in a health-disparate region in Virginia and North Carolina and to determine if the availability of healthy foods differed by location (rural, urban) or by the predominant race (black, white, mixed race) of an area’s population. Methods: Restaurants offering a children’s menu in the 3 counties in Virginia and North Carolina that make up the Dan River Region were identified by using state health department records. Research assistants reviewed menus using the Children’s Menu Assessment (CMA), a tool consisting of 29 scored items (possible score range, −4 to 21). Scores were calculated for each restaurant. We obtained information on the predominant race of the population at the block group level for all counties from 2010 US Census data. Results: For the 137 restaurants studied, mean CMA scores were low (mean, 1.6; standard deviation [SD], 2.7), ranging from −4 to 9 of 21 possible points. Scores were lowest for restaurants in the predominantly black block groups (mean, 0.2; SD, 0.4) and significantly different from the scores for restaurants in the predominantly white (mean, 1.4; SD, 1.6) and mixed-race block groups (mean, 2.6; SD, 2.4) (F = 4.3; P < .05). Conclusion: Children’s menus available in the Dan River Region lack healthy food options, particularly in predominantly black block groups. These study findings can contribute to regional efforts in policy development or environmental interventions for children’s food quality by the community-based participatory research partnership and help local stakeholders to determine possible strategies and solutions for improving local food options for children.

Different trajectories were revealed for hours worked, children, and financial dependence on parents, spouses, and government aid. No differences were found in employment rates, marriage rates, or financial dependence on own income.

Abstract = {The hypothesis that father absence during childhood, as well as other forms of childhood psychosocial stress, might influence the timing of sexual maturity and adult reproductive behaviors has been the focus of considerable research. However, the majority of studies that have examined this prediction have used samples of women of European descent living in industrialized, low-fertility nations. This paper tests the father-absence hypothesis using the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS), which samples young adults in Cape Town, South Africa. The sample contains multiple racial groups (blacks, coloureds [mixed race], and whites) and includes both males and females. Dependent variables include age at menarche, age at first sexual intercourse, and age at first pregnancy. Childhood stress is measured by father absence by age six (either never lived with father or lived with father some but not all years) and an index of childhood exposure to violence (measuring threatened or actual verbal or physical abuse). The hypothesis received no support for effect on age at menarche but was supported for age at first sex and first pregnancy. The model showed stronger support for coloureds and whites than blacks and had no predictive power at all for black males. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Positive Action is a school-based program that aims to decrease problem behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use) and increase positive behaviors (e.g., school engagement, academic achievement). Although a number of studies have shown that Positive Action successfully achieves these goals, few studies have evaluated the program’s effectiveness in rural schools. Given that rural youth are at an increased risk for risky behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use), this is a critical gap in the existing Positive Action research base. The current study assesses the impact of Positive Action on change rates of self-esteem, school hassles, aggression, and internalizing symptoms in a group (N = 1246, 52 % female) of ethnically/racially diverse (27 % White, 23 % African American, 12 % mixed race/other, 8 % Latino, 30 % as American Indian) middle school youth (age range 9–20) located in two violent, low-income rural counties in North Carolina. One county engaged in Positive Action over the 3-year study window while the other county did not. Following multiple imputation and propensity score analysis, 4 two-level hierarchical linear models were run using each of the outcome measures as dependent variables. The results indicate that the program generates statistically significant beneficial effects for youth from the intervention county on self-esteem scores and school hassles scores. Although the program generates beneficial effects for intervention youth on the change in aggression scores, the finding is not statistically significant. The finding on the change in internalizing scores shows a non-significant detrimental effect: the youth from the comparison county have lower internalizing scores than those from the intervention county. Implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In 2003, teachers at the municipal high school in Belmonte, Brazil, began presenting students with a radically different ideology about racial categorization: an essentialized ideology that defines anyone not "purely" branco (white) as negro (black). This system of categorization conflicts with popular belief in a mixed-race moreno identity based not only on ancestry but also on observable physical features. Through a combination of ethnographic and experimental methods, I examine this apparent clash of ideologies in Belmonte with respect to academic theories on the cognition of race and ethnicity. I show how children and adults integrate certain aspects of essentialism but not others in their constructions of identity and in the way they reason about hypothetical scenarios. These nuanced solutions to the challenges posed by explicit conflicts over supposedly natural categories lead to my own questioning of race in anthropological theory.

Jacobs (2011), Barack Obama in Hawai'i and Indonesia: The Making of a Global President by Dinesh Sharma (2011), Obama on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President by Justin A. Frank (2011), Barack Obama and the Politics of Redemption by Stanley A. Renshon (2011) and Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington, and the Education of A President by Ron Suskind (2011). Sally H. Jacobs' well-researched biography, The Other Barack: The Bold and Reckless Life of President Obama's Father, helps us sort through some myths surrounding the relationship of the President's parents. Dinesh Sharma writes about the physical abuse of Barack Jr.'s childhood in Indonesia and Hawaii. Justin Frank has written Obama on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President. Frank recognizes that Ann Obama needed to disguise the family history when dealing with her son. For the notion of "the mother and son" being "left by the father," Frank writes, "is a fantasy" as the mother "was living in Settle at the time of Barack Sr's departure." Frank says this is a "myth" that protects Obama from anger at his mother. Stanley Renshon in Barack Obama and the Politics of Redemption, sees the President's political agenda as originating in his personal psychology. Renshon maintains "that Obama has still not reconciled himself to his mixed race and cultural background". Some of these diverging views can be clarified when examining how President Obama handled the economic and political challenges following the severe 2008 recession. Economic and political policy are central subjects of Ron Suskind's Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington, and the Education of A President. His account of how Obama functioned in the drive for health care reform diverges from Renshon's. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

To do this, I shall consider Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and in particular, his 'language-game' methodology. I would like to examine the implications of the use of words, phrases and concepts which categorise on the basis of race, for example: 'black', 'white', 'Asian', 'mixed-race', 'the black community' and so forth, and to consider what assumptions lie therein, what purpose such descriptions serve and what problems they may create. It seems to me that such questions are of value within a therapeutic setting when matters of identity and belonging are concerned, especially in relation to so-called 'ethnic-minority' clients.

Abstract = {The issue of race has long cast a shadow on the founding mythology of the United States, but today some scholars argue race is declining in significance, as evidenced by the rise of interracial unions and the fact that the offspring of such unions can now officially acknowledge their mixed-race backgrounds. However, the sizeable growth of the Asian and Latino populations in the United States through immigration complicates the issue. Seemingly neither black nor white, the new immigrants are generating increased diversity and raising questions about whether today's color line replicates the old Black–White demarcation. The research results introduced in this article suggest the contemporary color line in the United States more reflects a Black/non-Black division than a White/non-White one.

Among the issues addressed in this volume are transnational adoption, ethnicity and assisted reproduction, mixed-race families, immigration, the transmission of ethnicity in post-Soviet Lithuania, and changing conceptions of Basque racial identity. This book is a useful and illuminating read for those with a particular interest in the ways in which new technologies and associated practices are changing ways of thinking about kinship in Europe. All the chapters in this volume ask questions about the supposedly ‘given’ nature of kinship. By interrogating the boundaries between nature and culture, the authors illustrate the varied ways in which the supposedly natural relations that are the basis of much racial and ethnic categorization are produced in local social, cultural, and historical worlds. However, despite its strengths, this volume has several weaknesses. A lack of explicitness in methodology may leave the reader wondering how some of the authors arrived at their conclusions. In addition, many of the studies rely heavily on media or print sources. The chapters that make use of both media sources and interviews or participant observation provide a stronger, more convincing and more varied body of evidence than those that rely more exclusively on media sources.

Abstract = {This book explores changing American views of race mixing in the twentieth century, showing how new scientific ideas transformed accepted notions of race and how those ideas played out on college campuses in the 1960s. In the 1930s it was not unusual for medical experts to caution against miscegenation, or race mixing, espousing the common opinion that it would produce biologically dysfunctional offspring. By the 1960s the scientific community roundly refuted this theory. Paul Lawrence Farber traces this revolutionary shift in scientific thought, explaining how developments in modern population biology, genetics, and anthropology proved that opposition to race mixing was a social prejudice with no justification in scientific knowledge. In the 1960s, this new knowledge helped to change attitudes toward race and discrimination, especially among college students. Their embrace of social integration caused tension on campuses across the country. Students rebelled against administrative interference in their private lives, and university regulations against interracial dating became a flashpoint in the campus revolts that revolutionized American educational institutions. Farber's provocative study is a personal one, featuring interviews with mixed-race couples and stories from the author's student years at the University of Pittsburgh. As such, Mixing Races offers a unique perspective on how contentious debates taking place on college campuses reflected radical shifts in race relations in the larger society.

Throughout the history of the field, psychological discourse has been shaped by social concerns, and its discourse on race is no exception. Psychologists have both promoted and fought against racism, and a nuanced historical account requires analysis of both dimensions. The contributors seek to understand the relationship between the changes in the field and broader social change by mapping the changing discourse for "defining difference" through race. Topics covered include essentialism and the history of the concept of race, ideas of race in the work of nineteenth-century and twentieth-century psychologists, psychological discourse on topics such as "mixed-race" people, political uses of racial research, changes in textbook presentations of race and intelligence, and international perspectives on psychology and race. Contributors also examine the prominence and persistence of American research on racial differences in intelligence as well as the work of Kenneth Clark and Horace Mann Bond in combating racism in science and society.

Abstract = {This paper explores how multiracial parents with White partners articulate narratives of ethnic and racial ‘dilution’ and cultural loss in relation to the socialization of their children. In our broader study of how multiracial parents raise their children, we found that parents commonly spoke of concerns around dilution and generational change in relation to four key themes: the loss of cultural knowledge and diminishing practices that connected parents and their children to a minority ancestry; the embodiment of White‐appearing children and the implications of this for family relationships; the use of biological or genetic discourses in relation to reduced blood quantum; and concerns amongst Black/White participants about whitening and the loss of racial consciousness. Parental understandings of dilution varied greatly; some expressed sadness at ‘inevitable’ loss; others were more philosophical about generational change; and others still proactively countered loss through strategies to connect their children to their minority heritages. We show that despite growing awareness of the social constructedness of race and an emergent cosmopolitanism among these parents, discourses of genetics, cultural lineage, and the ‘naturalness’ of race continue to hold sway amongst many multiracial parents.

Abstract = {Psychological research in the USA and elsewhere suggests that race is regarded as an underlying, inherited "essential" trait, like membership in a biological species. Yet Brazil has often been regarded as very different from the USA: as a country in which racial variation is seen as more continuous than categorical, more a matter of appearance than descent. This study tests alternative theories of racial cognition in Bahia, Brazil. Data include racial classification of drawings and photographs, judgments of similarity—dissimilarity between racial categories, ideas about expected and possible race of offspring from inter-racial unions, heritability of racial and non-racial traits, and conservation of race through changes in appearance. The research demonstrates consensus over time in appearance-based classification, yet race is also thought of as an "essential" trait. However, racial essences can be mixed, with a person containing the hereditary potential of multiple races, so that race in Bahia does not define clear-cut groups or discrete "living kinds." If essentialism is the shared core of folk theories of race, there may be more variability and room for social construction in the categorization of mixed-race individuals.

Abstract = {Decades of research supports the presence of significant genetic influences on children’s internalizing (emotional), externalizing (acting out), and social difficulties, including victimization. Additionally, being victimized has been shown to relate to further behavioral problems. The current study assessed the nature of the gene–environment relationships between the DRD4 gene, peer victimization, and externalizing and internalizing difficulties in 6- to 10-year-old children. 174 children (56 % girls; 88.6 % Caucasian, 3.4 % African American, 8 % mixed race or Mayan) and their parents were administered victimization and problem behavior questionnaires, and DRD4 was genotyped for the children. An interaction between genes (DRD4) and environment (victimization) was significant and supported the differential susceptibility model for verbal victimization and child-reported externalizing behaviors. Children with the DRD4 7-repeat allele were differentially responsive to the verbal victimization environment, such that those experiencing little to no victimization reported significantly lower levels of externalizing behaviors, but if they experienced high amounts of victimization, they reported the highest levels of externalizing behaviors. Thus, consideration of how genes and environment affect children’s experiences of victimization prior to adolescence is essential for understanding the trajectory of both externalizing and internalizing behaviors during adolescent development.

The results demonstrated that the RSES was psychometrically sound for the five groups. The minimal effects of sociodemographic characteristics on global self-esteem showed that the RSES and its two dimensions, self-competence (SC) and self-liking (SL), were suitable in this setting. All five groups scored above the theoretical midpoint of the RSES, indicating that generally positive self-evaluations appear to be universal. The relationships between positively and negatively worded items, SC, and SL attested to the following: internal structure reliability, congruence between positive and negative items, no negative biases in response, and concordance between SC and SL dimensions. The significant differences between informal settlement residents and the other four groups on global self-esteem, positively and negatively worded items, and SC and SL were possibly due to physiological needs taking precedence over higher order needs.

Across 2 studies, there was evidence for the validation of the 25-item MEM with 5 subscales including Shifting Expressions, Perceived Racial Ambiguity, Creating Third Space, Multicultural Engagement, and Multiracial Discrimination. The 5-subscale structure of the MEM was supported by a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Evidence of criterion-related validity was partially supported with MEM subscales correlating with measures of racial diversity in one’s social network, color-blind racial attitude, psychological distress, and identity conflict. Evidence of discriminant validity was supported with MEM subscales not correlating with impression management. Implications for future research and suggestions for utilization of the MEM in clinical practice with multiracial adults are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Methods: One hundred seventy-seven participants, primarily of white and mixed race (97 seronegative subjects: aged 44.7 ± 1.3 years, 85 [87.6%] men, 28 [28.9%] APOE ɛ41; 80 HIV+ subjects: Aged 47.± 6 1.1 years, 73 [91.3%] men, 23 [28.8%] APOE ɛ41), were assessed cross-sectionally for metabolite concentrations using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 4 brain regions and for neuropsychological performance. Results: Frontal white matter myo-inositol was elevated in subjects with HIV across the age span but showed age-dependent increase in seronegative subjects, especially in APOE ɛ41 carriers. In contrast, only seronegative APOE ɛ41 subjects showed elevated myo-inositol in parietal cortex. All APOE ɛ41 subjects had lower total creatine in basal ganglia. While all HIV subjects showed greater cognitive deficits, HIV1 APOE ɛ41 subjects had the poorest executive function, fluency memory, and attention/working memory. Higher myo-inositol levels were associated with poorer fine motor function across all subjects, slower speed of information processing in APOE ɛ41 subjects, and worse fluency in HIV1 APOE ɛ41 subjects. Conclusions: In frontal white matter of subjects with HIV, the persistent elevation and lack of normal age-dependent increase in myo-inositol suggest that persistent glial activation attenuated the typical antagonistic pleiotropic effects of APOE ɛ4 on neuroinflammation. APOE ɛ4 negatively affects energy metabolism in brain regions rich in dopaminergic synapses. The combined effects of HIV infection and APOE ɛ4 may lead to greater cognitive deficits, especially in those with greater neuroinflammation. APOE ɛ4 allele(s) may be a useful genetic marker to identify white and mixed-race HIV subjects at risk for cognitive decline. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reviews the film, Black Or White directed by Mike Binder (2014). This film is about the life of Eloise, a mixed-race 7-year-old being raised solely by her White grandfather (Elliot Anderson) following the death of her maternal grandmother (his wife). When Elliot’s wife could look after Eloise, Rowena Jeffers, her paternal grandmother who is Black, had been content with the situation, but now, she says, her extended Black family is Eloise’s real family, and if the child grows up without them, she will have something fundamental missing from her sense of self. Part of our sociality is to think in terms of in-groups or out-groups, which can depend on things like nationality, gender, race, a sports team we support, and the kind of clothes we wear. With this kind of proclivity, something visible like color, although only skin deep, can be taken as significant. In the human history of international conflict, of socioeconomic status, and of slavery, color has become important because we have made it so. Black or White is a worthwhile film because it is not clear for any of us how much of our mental model of a person comes from assumptions and how much from our history of interaction with that person. How does an idea that “he’s a member of another race” or “she’s overdressed” stack up with “he did something I resent” or “she’s been really helpful”? We are affected not just by thoughts but by prethoughts. Is it our first thought, or prethought, that counts? This is the question the film puts forth. Best of all, it puts the question in a way that invites us to consider how we feel about such issues, and to think about the issues for ourselves.

Abstract = {Educational achievement and attainment are associated with health outcomes across the entire life span. The objective of this study was to determine whether racial/ethnic disparities in academic achievement and educational aspirations have changed over time. The study used data from the Minnesota Student Survey (MSS) from 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010. The MSS is administered to adolescents in public secondary schools, charter schools, and tribal schools. Measures of academic achievement and educational aspirations were examined by race/ethnicity, poverty status, and family structure. Chi square tests evaluated differences in the above proportions. The analytic sample included 351,510 adolescents (1998, N = 67,239; 2001, N = 69,177; 2004, N = 71,084; 2007, N = 72,312; and 2010, N = 71,698). Study participants ranged in age from 13 to 19 years (mean = 15.9, SD = 1.6). Most were white (81.7 %), followed by 5.4 % Asian American/Pacific Islander, 4.3 % Black/African American, 2.7 % Hispanic/Latino, 1 % American Indian, and 4.9 % mixed race. Results showed that academic achievement fluctuated amongst all the racial/ethnic groups, but there were significant race/ethnic disparities at every time point. Overall, academic aspirations increased over time among the adolescents. Poverty was associated with poorer academic indicators for white youth, but not consistently for other racial/ethnic groups of youth. Family structure, however, was significantly associated with the educational indicators across all racial and ethnic groups. Despite many efforts to improve educational outcomes, there remain significant disparities in educational achievement and aspirations related to race-ethnicity and social status. Findings have implications for efforts to improve adolescent health at both individual and community levels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This paper explores the concept of the categorization of social groups by looking at the issue of ascribed categories of identity for children and young people of mixed parentage. Our exploration of the knowledge-base in this area reveals that children and young people have clearly expressed views about their racial identity and that these views are broadly consistent across research studies. In essence, children and young people's expressed views are that they are not mixed-race, black or white, but are in fact brown. The emerging sociology of childhood and the government's current child participation agenda emphasize the centrality of children and young peoples' perspectives on the provision of services that seek to support them. Through this perception, which places children and young people's own understandings of their racial identity at the forefront of the analysis, we added fresh understandings to the existing data concerning ascribed categories of identity for children and young people of mixed parentage.

Abstract = {In this provocative book Mary Weismantel explores experiences, practices and social structures of race and sex in the Andes through stories generated around two contradictory characters, cultural icons that thrive on tensions between fantasy and reality. Images of mixed race cholas arouse in white men both desire and disgust for women who difference makes them exciting and whose racial and sexual subordination makes them available. Stories of horrifying white bogeymen called pishtacos frighten poor Indians and women, and evoke their own vulnerability to the predations of the powerful. Weismantel argues that the cultural icons of the sensual brown woman called chola and the aggressively penetrating white man known as pishtaco are not innocent fantasies, for they arouse the violent passions of societies fractured by race and sex, and divided by vast economic inequalities. In a book that is not about gays or lesbians per se, Weismantel helps to queer Andean studies by questioning heteronormative assumptions that often frame discussions of rape, body and identity.

A sample consisting of 96, jury eligible White Australians read one of four versions of a real trial transcript, in which the race of a male defendant and female victim were varied. The participants imposed the severest sentences on the Indigenous (Black) defendant. Jurors were most lenient with White defendants who killed a White victim. Female jurors were more punitive than the males toward the Indigenous defendant. Jurors processed evidence systematically in same-race trials, but used both systematic and heuristic processing in mixed-race trials. In these instances, female jurors employed significantly more emotive responses, especially when the victim was Black. The effects of subtle racism and the black processing effect when the victim was non-White are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The racial/ethnic composition of the US population is shifting, with the nonwhite population growing faster than whites. We examined cannabis use disorder (CUD) prevalences and correlates in seven racial/ethnic groups. We included cannabis use (CU) prevalence as a comparison. Data were from the 2005–2011 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (N = 394,400). Substance use among respondents aged ≥12 years was assessed by computer-assisted, self-interviewing methods. The following were included as control variables: age, sex, family income, government assistance, county type, residential stability, major depressive episode history, arrest history, nicotine dependence, alcohol disorder, and survey year. Past-year CU prevalence increased significantly from 10.45% in 2005 to 11.41–11.54% during 2009–2011. Compared with whites, mixed-race individuals had higher odds of CU; Asian Americans and Hispanics had lower odds of CU. There were no significant yearly changes in CUD prevalence in the sample during 2005–2011 (1.58–1.73%). Compared with whites, individuals who were mixed-race, black, and Native American had higher odds of CUD; Asian Americans had lower odds. In aggregate, 15.35% of past-year cannabis users met criteria for a CUD in the 12-month period. Past-year cannabis users who were black, Native American, Hispanic, or Asian American had higher odds of CUD than white users. In each racial/ethnic group, adolescent cannabis users generally showed greater odds of CUD than adult users. Behavioral health indicators (major depressive episode, arrest history, nicotine dependence, alcohol disorder) were associated with CU and CUD. In conclusion, CUD disproportionally affects nonwhite groups and youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article A Critique of Exchange Theory in Mate Selection by Michael J. Rosenfeld (2005). The article of Rosenfeld is one of the more serious and well-thought-out attempts to criticize the hypothesis, both theoretically and empirically. Rosenfeld concludes that simple and complex approaches both refute status exchange. He further claims that homogamy rather than exchange is the most important educational mating pattern in mixed-race couples. Explaining this discrepancy is important since the article by Rosenfeld may have given readers the false impression that complex models and simple models should always lead to the same findings. Loglinear models have often been difficult to interpret for the less technically oriented reader, as Rosenfeld correctly observes, and their complexity may have alienated part of the audience that was originally interested in the topic of intermarriage. Rosenfeld argues that it is important to take account of differential educational homogamy depending on race. If this is what Rosenfeld means by saying that these couples are based on solidarity and affection, he is probably right. But this does not translate into equally strong or stronger levels of educational homogamy—homogamy is weaker in these couples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In our research, we consider how young adults with parents of different racial backgrounds come to rewrite their racial identity, becoming biracial, multiracial, or mixed race. We study the personal narratives of biracial youth to understand how they talk about arriving at these new self-identifications. The personal narrative is an attempt to make sense of the self through time (Cohler, 1998) by organizing experience into an understandable story of the past, present, and future (Ricoeur, 1984). Through the workings of plot, the personal narrative configures the me into a story that conveys a sense of identity (McAdams, 1996). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

It goes beyond focusing on the extent of the racial achievement gap and demonstrates how this gap is maintained in schools on a daily basis. The use of student, parent, and staffulty voices throughout the work makes for an engaging read. While there are likely many common themes that will be found across mixed race high schools in the United States, there are also ways in which other types of racial dynamics, both within the school and in the geographic area, are likely to provide a differently nuanced understanding of the processes contributing to the presence of academic achievement disparities.

Abstract = {Peer victimization is a common and potentially detrimental experience for many adolescents. However, not all youth who are exposed to peer victimization experience maladaptive outcomes, such as depression. Thus, greater attention to potential moderators of peer victimization is particularly important. The current study examined the potential moderating effect of intrinsic religiosity and religious attendance on the longitudinal association between physical and relational victimization and depressive symptoms. A diverse sample of adolescents (N = 313; Mage = 17.13 years; 54% female; 49% Caucasian, 24% African American, 19% Latino, 8% mixed race/other; 80% Christian religious affiliation) were recruited from a rural, low-income setting. Adolescents completed self-report measures of religious attendance and intrinsic religiosity, and two forms of victimization (i.e., physical and relational) were assessed using sociometric procedures in 11th grade. Depressive symptoms were measured in both 11th and 12th grade. Results suggest that relational victimization is associated prospectively with depressive symptoms only under conditions of adolescents’ low intrinsic religiosity. Findings may contribute to efforts aimed at prevention and intervention among adolescents at risk for peer victimization and depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Methods: A cross-sectional 2011 Internet survey collected dyadic data from 275 HIV-negative and 58 HIV-discordant male couples to describe 631 HIV-negative partnered mens’ willingness to use PrEP and associated couple-level demographic and behavioral factors with multivariate multilevel modeling. Results: Fifty-three percent were very to extremely likely to use PrEP. Willingness was positively associated with being in a mixed race and behaviorally non-monogamous relationship, and with amyl nitrate use with sex outside the relationship. Willingness was negatively associated with having a college education. Conclusion: Prevention efforts should educate male couples about the potential benefits of PrEP.

Abstract = {Perceiving the pain of others activates similar neural structures to those involved in the direct experience of pain, including sensory and affective-motivational areas. Empathic responses can be modulated by race, such that stronger neural activation is elicited by the perception of pain in people of the same race compared with another race. In the present study, we aimed to identify when racial bias occurs in the time course of neural empathic responses to pain. We also investigated whether group affiliation could modulate the race effect. Using the minimal group paradigm, we assigned participants to one of two mixed-race teams. We examined event-related potentials from participants when viewing members of their own and the other team receiving painful or non-painful touch. We identified a significant racial bias in early ERP components at N1 over frontal electrodes, where Painful stimuli elicited a greater negative shift relative to Non-Painful stimuli in response to own race faces only. A long latency empathic response was also found at P3, where there was significant differentiation between Painful and Non-Painful stimuli regardless of Race or Group. There was no evidence that empathy-related brain activity was modulated by minimal group manipulation.

Abstract = {Limited national data document the prevalence of incarceration among transgender women, experiences of victimization while incarcerated, and associations of transgender status with health. Data were from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS), a large convenience sample of transgender adults in the U.S., collected between September 2008 and March 2009. Respondents who indicated a transfeminine gender identity were included in the current study (n = 3,878). Multivariable logistic regression was used to model ever being incarcerated and experiencing victimization while incarcerated as a function of race/ethnicity and health-related indicators. Overall, 19.3% reported having ever been incarcerated. Black and Native American/Alaskan Native transgender women were more likely to report a history of incarceration than White (non-Hispanic) respondents, and those with a history of incarceration were more likely to report negative health-related indicators, including self-reporting as HIV-positive. Among previously incarcerated respondents, 47.0% reported victimization while incarcerated. Black, Latina, and mixed race transgender women were more likely to report experiences of victimization while incarcerated. Transgender women reported disproportionately high rates of incarceration and victimization while incarcerated, as well as associated negative health-related indicators. Interventions and policy changes are needed to support transgender women while incarcerated and upon release. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

This book is one of those scholarly interventions that takes your breath away. Complex, razor sharp and beautifully written, it engages with several fields: multiraciality and ‘mixed race’, diaspora, coloniality, racism and nationalism, sexuality, gender and disability. From the very first pages of the book we are made aware of the complex and often contradictory interrelations of past and present; celebration and forgetting; figurations and fleshy bodies; and location and displacement. The author does so beautifully by constantly moving between the interviewees’ voices and those of feminist and queer-of colour scholars, where the former are never a pre-theorised raw material for a violent scholarly dissection.

Abstract = {In this article, Leary notes the value of traditional psychoanalytic modes of understanding race and its dynamics through the use of projective mechanisms as a way of understanding racism and stereotyping. But from the outset she argues that race (and she likens this to work on gender) is always personal and political, social and intrapsychic, the province of psychoanalysis and of social theory. Within this essay, turning a psychoanalytic lens on the field itself, she notes that race, arguably the most pressing social problem of the past 200 years, is often a silenced presence in clinical dyads with mixed race and in the writing of the field at large. As analysts, we must appreciate immediately the meanings potentiated in the silences Leary notices. Her clinical vignette shows the careful, difficult work of making voice where silence prevails. The vignette also illuminates the power of voicing hidden fantasies and meaning for many areas of psychic functioning. Finally, notice in her Afterword that Leary is thinking about writing. Any essay is both a progress report of the writer's thinking and another turn in a conversation that becomes more and more complex and interesting. It is certainly a very relational way to be thinking about writing. And this is a way of thinking also grounded in the particular kind of American pragmatism. Meaning and validity are adjudicated in a process of respectful and engaged conversation, addressed to the past surely but more crucially to the present and to future interlocutors.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, The Global Bell Curve: Race, IQ and Inequality Worldwide by R. Lynn (2008). The theme of the book is an examination of whether the same type of racial hierarchy in IQ and socio-economic status that Herrnstein and Murray documented in the US is present in other parts of the world. The author's new book provides fascinating historical vignettes to describe all the migrations and mixing of peoples. It also provides clear tables of data, which allow the reader to check the facts for themselves. The author argues that these theories are to some degree plausible for some countries, but are often ad hoc and do not explain the world wide consistency of the differences. The conclusion that IQ differences are the crucial determinant of racial socio-economic hierarchies raises the question of what causes the IQ inequalities. In principle, they could be wholly environmentally determined. However, the author argues that their consistency across time and circumstance points to genetic factors. He reviews other data in support including hybridization studies and finds that "mixed-race" populations fall between parental populations.

In the 1980 Census, 40% of Hispanics identified themselves racially as "other." In 1990 this proportion increased. In the current study, a nonrandom sample of 58 Latinos responded that they were "other" to a replica of the 1980 Census question on race. Results counter the interpretation that those who identify as "other" are of mixed race (mestizo) or misunderstand the question. Rather, the "other" response, it is argued, reflects a widespread view among Latinos that race is not so much a biological as a cultural, social, and/or political concept.

In response to Annabella Bushra's discussion and her focus on what is missing in the clinical material, the author speculates about the repetition of the historical trauma of purifying mixed race in the face of its complexity—trying to neatly package race despite it not so neatly fitting into any one category—and losing the individual by overly focusing on skin color. The author considers the silence, secrecy, and transgression in the treatment and, in this context, a few of Bushra's key points are addressed—sorting out the nature of hate in relation to Susan, passing as transgression, and White guilt. A distinction is made between a malevolent, destructive hate and a loving hate, and White guilt is considered as a defense against recognition of the other.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Christopher Bonovitz (see record [rid]2010-11288-008[/rid]). Christopher Bonovitz gives us a rich landscape of the theoretical, historical, and relational aspects of his work with his mixed-race patient. In my response I explore what seems missing: a stronger sense of the patient as a person, more of her own history in her family, more of the clinical back and forth with her therapist, a sense of what is being played out in the transference, and particularly what “passing” is for her. I show how his choices about how to think about her story and how to tell it are oversaturated with awareness of identity and race at the expense of the basic human relationship. In the face of such racial anxiety, there is a pull to rely too strongly on countertransference as a way to gain privileged access to knowledge about the other. I attribute many of these problems to the inescapable power of race in our culture. Furthermore, I address the themes of hatred, silence, secrecy and transgression as they relate to the history of transgenerational trauma for this patient and invite our broadening our awareness about how they play out in the therapeutic process. We are faced with the difficult, yet the essential task of holding and living out the patient's anger and outrage at the racial hatred that has been endured.

Abstract = {This chapter discusses multiracial college students, defined as students whose biological parents are of two or more different racial backgrounds or heritages (Root, 1992). The repeal of laws in the United States that opposed mixed-race coupling or marriages, brought about by the Loving et ux. v. Virginia (1967) Supreme Court decision, has resulted in a dramatic increase in interracial unions. Subsequently, there has also been a dramatic increase in the births of persons of mixed-race heritage. For the first time in its history, the 2000 Census provided persons of mixed-race heritages and backgrounds with the opportunity to describe how they identify racially by selecting more than one racial category (Root & Kelley, 2003). According to data from the 2000 Census, 6.8 million people were identified as being of more than one racial category, or multiracial (Jones & Smith, 2001). The multiracial population is young. Jones and Smith (2003) indicated that approximately 42% of the population is under 18 years of age and close to 70% is under 35 years of age. At the time of the 2000 Census, only 5.4% of the multiracial population was between the ages of 18 and 20; however, a dramatic increase is expected in the near future. Although all children do not aspire to attend college, these figures suggest that the number of multiracial individuals who will be attending college could also show a dramatic increase (Paladino, 2004).

This exploratory study describes the level of interaction among mono-racial and bi/multiracial students on a large campus. Additionally, this study sought the input of bi/multiracial students on how colleges and universities can create a welcoming environment for this population. Based on the findings, the following recommendations are offered: 1. Colleges and universities must take definitive steps to provide supportive services and opportunities for bi/multiracial students including the creation of student organizations and activities for those who would benefit from these. 2. Recognition must be given to the fact that all biracial students do not hold the same attitudes and opinions related to their mixed race heritage, when making decisions about programming for biracial students. 3. Universities must provide opportunities to increase awareness and understanding of the biracial population among faculty, students, and staff through professional development workshops, trainings, college courses, and opportunities for open dialogues. 4. Steps must be taken to reduce the invisibility of multiracial people in the curriculum. 5. Universities must develop creative ways to increase the number of students who are exposed to courses on diversity and race relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Little is known about public perspectives of scientific and therapeutic uses of placentas. Gaps in knowledge potentiate ethical and clinical problems regarding collection and applications. As such, this study sought to assess the perspectives of placenta donation of a sample of women. Postpartum women’s perspectives on placental donation were assessed at the State University of Campinas in the Centro de Atençäo Integral a Saúde da Mulher (CAISM) maternity hospital using a cross-sectional survey (n = 384) and semi-structured interviews (n = 12). Surveys were analyzed quantitatively and interviews were analyzed qualitatively using grounded coding; results were compared. The average age of respondents was 27. Fifty-six percent had more than one child, 45% were Caucasian, 38% were mixed-race, 74% identified with a Christian faith, 52% had high school education or higher, 13% regarded the placenta as spiritually important, 72% felt that knowing what happens to the placenta after birth was somewhat or very important, 78% supported the use of the placenta in research and medicine, 59% reported that consent to collect the placenta was very or somewhat important, 78% preferred their doctor to invite donation, and only 7% preferred the researcher to invite donation. Interviews suggested women appreciate being part of research and that receiving information about studies was important to them. Informed by these results, we argue that women support scientific and therapeutic uses of placentas, want to be included in decision making, and desire information about the placenta. Placentas should not be viewed as “throwaway” organs that are poised for collection without the involvement and permission of women. Women want to be meaningfully included in research processes.

Participants experience power struggles with co-owners in managing their private, relational information, and their disclosures often follow sequences that align with relational turning points.

Abstract = {Studied the effects of race on observer judgments of nonverbal communications (NVC) with the use of 2 sets of stimulus slides, showing (a) White or Black males individually and (b) same race (White) or mixed race (Black male, White female) interacting couples. For both sets of stimuli, 2 levels of nonverbal behavior were programmed, a "neutral" stance and a "positive," or in the case of couples, an "intimate" stance. The stimuli were presented to a 60-student sample and judgments were recorded on a set of 6 bipolar scales. Multivariate ANOVAs indicated that while NVC effects were highly significant for both sets of stimuli, race effects were only significant on evaluative scales, and this effect could be wholly attributed to an interaction of race and NVC cues. Thus, for individual stimulus persons, the effects of positive NVC are relatively attenuated for Black models, and for couples the effects of nonverbal intimacy are more accentuated for mixed-race couples.

I investigate how race and ethnicity are implicated in the recognition process in Brazil on the basis of an analysis of a successful struggle for indigenous identity and access to land by a group of mixed-race, visibly, African-descended rural workers. I propose that the debate over mestizaje (ethnoracial and cultural mixing) in the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America can be reconfigured and clarified by broadening it to include such Brazilian experiences. I argue that the interaction between two processes--law making and indigenous identity formation--is crucial to understanding how the notion of "mixed heritage" is both reinforced and disentangled. As such, this article is an illustration of the role of legal discourse in the constitution of indigenous identities and it introduces northeastern Brazil into the global discussion of law, indigenous rights, and claims to citizenship.

Abstract = {This article examines the identity formation of middle-class Haitian youth. Segmented assimilation theory predicts that the Haitian second generation will integrate into the black American underclass or maintain strong ethnic group identities. The black middle class, however, is an unexplored pathway of cultural assimilation. This paper uses the literature on the racial and class experiences of the black American middle class as a departure point for understanding the boundary work of middle-class Haitian youth. Based on qualitative interviews and a focus group, we uncover the mechanisms of identity formation for this invisible population. Racial, ethnic and class boundaries compel Haitian youths to create strategies of either empowerment or distancing. They negotiate between their middle-class status and ethnoracial exclusion in a racially segregated neighbourhood, an ethnically homogenous church and a mixed-race school setting. This study's findings extend our theoretical understandings of middle-class immigrants and their identity work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Tested the consequences of ignoring or overriding the distinctive features of the cognitive system by which Brazilians express their race/color identities. A salient vernacular term (morena) was substituted for the seldom-used term (parda) that the Brazilian census offers as self-identification for a person who has both Black and White color/race features. When morena was offered in a split census, the proportion of respondents who self-identified as being of mixed color/race substantially increased while the proportion identifying as White or Black substantially declined. Findings suggest an error of imposing on the rest of the hemisphere rigid dichotomous (White/non-White) or trichotomous (White/mixed/Black) categories deemed appropriate for establishing racial identity in the US.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Weaving a Family: Untangling Race and Adoption by Barbara Katz Rothman (2005). This is a personal book, more auto-ethnography than memoir. The author grounds her theory in the practice of mothering, race, adoption, and sociology. The author uses mothering (whether performed by women or men), not parenting, as the term for the practices and work of caring for children. Her discussion integrates the complexities of genetic science and genetic ideologies. The child-as-pet theme reflects the traditional relationship of a mother to her small child. The mother indulges her children, but also indulges herself in the joys of nurturing. This is an excellent book for anyone considering transracial adoption or who is a member of a mixed-race family. Those interested in issues of race will benefit from what Weaving a Family teaches us about the tensions between our personal experiences and the social contexts in which they are shaped and interpreted.

They cite several other authors who have discussed the limitations in research analysis, inappropriate classifications of groups, and the use of suboptimal model for genetic cluster analysis. Despite advances in genetic analysis, clinicians and epidemiologists still disagree on the usefulness of race in clinical reporting. Sinha et al present data from an admixture analysis study they did on a sample population. The specifics of the study are explained. Although the need for cautious interpretation of racial data is indisputable, genetic analyses show that self-reported race is informative for the classification of genetic clusters. Although self-reported blacks in the United States are largely of mixed race, genetic admixture analyses show clear differences between self-reported blacks and whites, indicating that self-reported race provides a means for identifying distinct groups.

Abstract = {Race is a socially constructed way of grouping people, which differs among societies and over time. It has no biological basis. In the United States, many individuals have experienced misrepresentation because of restrictive racial labels. Multiracial is an inclusive identification term that "refers to people who are of two or more racial heritages" and refers "to people across all racial mixes". The multiracial movement, which gained momentum in the late 1970's and early 1980's, has been proactively addressing the unique issues of the mixed race population in the United States. The multiracial movement is being pursued by people dedicated to the advancement of the rights and self-expression of multiracial individuals and families. Our chapter aims to advance the multiracial movement by bridging the language barrier that is present both within the mixed-race community and between multiracial and monoracial persons. We propose that this language barrier is the lack of a vernacular that is sufficiently reflective of the identities and existence of people of mixed heritage. The voice and authentic experiences of racially mixed people within the United States have been suppressed and silenced by a lack of inclusive terminology. Current racial conceptualizations emphasize an either/or approach that can unnecessarily dichotomize identity for people of racially mixed heritage. There is a need for people to openly consider the multiple possibilities of mixed race individuals' heritages. The language barrier in the United States can be overcome if society as a whole is willing to adopt a multiracial-affirmative language and mindset. In this chapter, we advocate suggestions for how all individuals—both multiracial and monoracial persons—can use various mixed race identity terminology, see the world through a multiracial-affirmative lens, and implement multiracial-affirmative actions.

Abstract = {In an attempt to comprehend the perceptions held about racially similar and dissimilar couples, 4 issues were examined. First, differences in perceptions based on the couple's racial composition were investigated. It was hypothesized that perceptions about the couple, its members, and its relationship quality would be more positive for same-race dyads than mixed-race couples. Second, the authors examined the impact of intimacy level on perceptions of these dyads. Pairs who were friends were predicted to receive more positive perceptions than the engaged couples. Third, it was hypothesized that racially dissimilar couples who were engaged would be perceived more negatively than the racially similar friend and engaged dyads and the racially dissimilar friend pairs. Lastly, the authors looked at the possible sex- and race-of-the-perceiver effects on perceptions of these dyads. Ss were 207 undergraduates. Results supported the 1st and 2nd hypotheses, and there was partial evidence for the last. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 to compare family characteristics of adolescents of a mixed-race or multiethnic background with those of a monoracial or monoethnic background. Mixed-race or multiethnic youth reported feeling less supported by parents and reported less satisfactory parent-adolescent relationships. Mixed-race/multiethnic youth were more like monoracial White youth in terms of being independent but were more like racial or ethnic minorities (African Americans, Hispanics) in regard to family activities. Reasons for these findings are explored. We discuss the need for future research on the experiences of mixed-race/multiethnic youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: The Internet and other eHealth technologies offer a platform for improving the dissemination and accessibility of psychoeducational programs for youth with chronic illness. However, little is known about the recruitment process and yield of diverse samples in Internet research with youth who have a chronic illness. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of youth with Type 1 diabetes on recruitment, participation, and satisfaction with 2 eHealth psychoeducational programs. Methods: Youth with Type 1 diabetes from 4 sites in the United States were invited to participate (N = 510) with 320 eligible youth consenting (mean age = 12.3, SD 1.1; 55.3% female; 65.2% white; and mean A1C = 8.3, SD 1.5). Data for this secondary analysis included demographic information (age, race/ethnicity, and income), depressive symptoms, and recruitment rates, including those who refused at point of contact (22.0%), passive refusers who consented but did not participate (15.3%), and those who enrolled (62.7%). Participation (80% lessons completed) and a satisfaction survey (ie, how helpful, enjoyable) were also analyzed. Chi-square or analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses were used. Results: There were significant differences in recruitment rates by income and race/ethnicity such that black, Hispanic, or mixed race/ethnicity and low-income youth were more likely to refuse passively compared to white and higher-income youth who were more likely to enroll (P < .001). Participation in program sessions was high, with 78.1% of youth completing at least 4 of 5 sessions. There were no significant differences in participation by program, age, gender, or race/ethnicity. Low-income youth were less likely to participate (P = .002). Satisfaction in both programs was also high (3.9 of 5). There were significant gender, race/ethnicity, and income differences, in that girls (P = .001), black, Hispanic, or mixed race/ethnicity youth (P = .02), and low-income youth (P = .02) reported higher satisfaction. There were no differences in satisfaction by program or age. Conclusions: Results indicate that black, Hispanic, or mixed race/ethnicity youth and low-income youth with Type 1 diabetes are less likely to enroll in Internet-based research than white and higher-income youth; thus, creative recruitment approaches are needed. Low-income youth were less likely to participate, possibly due to access. However, once enrolled, youth of diverse race/ethnicity and low-income youth with Type 1 diabetes were as highly satisfied with the eHealth programs as white youth and those with higher income. Results suggest that eHealth programs have the potential to reach diverse youth and be appealing to them. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

In this article, I explain how and why a mixed‐race Mapuche shaman charged me with writing about her life and practice in the form of such a “bible.” This book would become a ritual object and a means of storing her shamanic power by textualizing it, thereby allowing her to speak to a future audience. The realities and powers her “bible” stored could be extracted, transformed, circulated, and actualized for a variety of ends, even to bring about shamanic rebirth. Ultimately, I argue, through their use and interpretation of this kind of “bible,” Mapuche shamans expand academic notions of indigenous history and literacy.

Abstract = {Taken together, Section 2 discusses several different kinds of innovators or cheaters—if you will—in our society and the sources of anomie or strain that motivate them. Merton wrote about garden variety criminals and juvenile delinquent. Hagedorn reports on inner-city drug dealers. My connections reading discusses doping among elite athletes, and this introduction describes college students' illicit use of prescribed stimulants to achieve their academic goals. While it is true that all of us, despite our backgrounds, are susceptible to some level of anomie and strain, it is also true that there are racial and class patterns to deviant innovations. Merton studied the poor. Hagedorn focused on disadvantaged blacks. Doping in professional sports is a mixed-race, privileged group, while the college students popping Adderall to pass their exams are largely middle class and white. One question to consider then is if patterns in deviant innovation are related to cultural differences between race and ethnic groups or to economic status and social class position? Perhaps styles of innovation are simply a combination of a variety of social dimensions, including race, ethnicity, class, age, and gender. If so, then another important question to ask is, which types of cheating, and by whom, are tolerated in our society and which are not? How would you explain the differences? Which types of innovation and groups would you explain with the more macrolevel anomie theory or the more microlevel general strain theory? Would you combine them? I hope the readings in this section help you reach some conclusions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (introduction)},

Abstract = {The election of Barack Hussein Obama as the forty-fourth president of the United States suggests that conventional notions of blackness are being disaggregated. The old hypodescent rule has lost its power to define who is black and who is not, especially for light-skinned black Americans and individuals with some African ancestry and one white parent. Further, conventional racial designations today may be less important than factors such as skin tone, especially when combined with traditional tropes of high-status whiteness like elite education, stable family structure, high socioeconomic status, and "command of spoken English." Empirical research suggests the existence of a small group of light-skinned black elites that dates back to the antebellum era who were able to accumulate and pass on small amounts of wealth. The intergenerational transfer of even small amounts of wealth created opportunities for their descendants not available to most black Americans. Today, these' descendants still benefit from the advantages created as a result of light skin tone and relative economic success. This group and the mixed-race children of one white parent are posed to move beyond unitary blackness into a middle group between white and most black Americans. The movement away from unitary blackness may result in a pigmentocracy that reinforces whiteness even as the country becomes less white. One byproduct of this change is that racial inequality between those raced as white and black will become more severe. Twentieth-century antidiscrimination laws that treat blackness as one-dimensional are ill equipped to combat more subtle race-based discrimination. This chapter explores whether skin tone, rather than racial classification or racial self-identification, will, in the near future, determine who gets better access to quality education, jobs, and real power in America; in other words, does color and socioeconomic status, more than old racial classification schemes, matter in the "post-racial" Obama era and, if so; what are the legal implications of this development?

Abstract = {I never wanted to be White growing up. It is a good thing because I was not. But now, I am almost White in some people's eyes. How this happened tells not only a piece of some of my life story but, in hindsight, has allowed some of my critical thinking around racial and ethnic identity formation. My transformation of color has not been my own doing but a reflection of a larger racial project in this country. Reflections on my racial transformation, raised by one parent not familiar with the racial system of the United States and the other having internalized the system so well, figured critically into how I have been able to think about identity formation. I had to for survival's sake--both in the world and to make sense out of the subtleties of human interaction. When I came to the United States with my mother as a small child, we were not White.

Abstract = {This final chapter discusses psychotherapy in light of oppression due to gender, race and class. It reads in part: The important point for me as a psychotherapist is that this racist history has influenced how I see myself, the interest I take in my work, and what kind of work I do. It is no accident that most of my professional life has been spent working with mixed-race groups, exploring issues to do with black/white identity, and working with oppressed groups, because that is part of me. In contrast I must admit that another part of me was white supremacist—I was putting down black people and Asians as all Anglo Indians did, because they did not want to identify with the oppressed Asians. But although growing up in that kind of a family has taught me a lot, gut feeling just hasn't been enough. I have also had to look at how I could make use of existing theories and methods and work that has been done in the past. I am not going to be an apologist for psychotherapy. I would actually be harder than most on European, white psychotherapy because I have seen its tremendous failings and it has not given me enough—although I am a clinical psychologist with psychotherapy training—because its practice and its professional institutions are both severely limited and dominated by white Eurocentric thought.

Abstract = {Objectives: Contact theory posits that interracial contact can reduce racial prejudice and perceptions of prejudice. This relationship typically has been looked at from the perspective of whites’ views regarding race and racial relations, but few studies have examined the implications of interracial contact for blacks’ perceptions regarding the extent of prejudice and discrimination. Methods: With data from the National Survey of Black Workers, I examine whether opportunities for contact in settings with varying racial concentrations in youth and adulthood are associated with blacks’ perceptions of prejudice. I use racial concentration—measured here as mostly black settings, half‐black (racially balanced) settings, and mostly white settings (compared to all‐black settings)—as an indicator of opportunities for interracial contact. Results: Multivariate analyses offer some evidence of the benefits of opportunities for contact in mixed‐race and mostly white settings for blacks’ perceptions of prejudice. Conclusion: Although having opportunities for contact can be beneficial, this evidence is limited to noncompetitive childhood environments, namely residential neighborhoods. Findings highlight the important of accounting for the racial balance of settings where interracial contact takes place. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Principles of Mendelian genetics are not violated by anthropological findings that mixed races formed by hybridization between major known races have on the whole little or no more variability, perhaps in some cases even less, than the original races. However, "unincreased variability can not (as sometimes stated) be related to the number of generations of breeding of the mixed race, but must be as evident in F2 as later." Several possible Mendelian interpretations are given: (1) the more plausible is that most of "the intraracial variation of the original races is caused by relatively recessive genes that individually (at each given locus) are rather rare, but taken together are numerous"; and (2) "this variation is for the most part referable to different loci in the different major races, even though a variation of a similar phenotypic kind results." Requirements are stated that should be met by any future body of data dealing with the problem at issue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Two studies examined the consequences of this identity denial. In Study 1, mixed-race participants reported that their biracial or multiracial identity caused tension in a variety of contexts. Study 2 focused on one often-mentioned situation: completing a demographic questionnaire in which only one racial background can be specified. Relative to mixed-race participants who were permitted to choose multiple races, those compelled to choose only one showed lower subsequent motivation and self-esteem. These studies demonstrate the negative consequences of constraining mixed-race individuals’ expression of their chosen racial identity.

Abstract = {While many studies have established the relationship between experiences of racism and sexual risk among men of colour who have sex with men, the pathways by which this occurs are underdeveloped. To address this gap, we must better investigate the lived realities of racism in the gay community. In this study, we had the unique opportunity to examine experiences of racism among African American, Asian/Pacific Islander and Latino men who have sex with men living in Los Angeles through focus groups and individual in-depth interviews. We found three themes of racism: exclusion from West Hollywood and the mainstream gay community, sexual rejection based on race/ethnicity and sexual stereotypes. There were differences across the three racial groups in the experiences of each theme, however. We then considered how racism impacted partner selection and found that race played a salient role in determining power differentials within mixed-race partnerships. Finally, we discussed several future areas for research that can better establish pathways between racism and sexual risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Obama and the biracial factor: The battle for a new American majority edited by Andrew J. Jolivette (2012). This book a collection of essays that critically explore the role of US President Barack Obama’s biracial background not only in his 2008 election and first term in office but also in the context of an increasingly multiracial USA. This volume is part of a multidisciplinary body of scholarship on 'mixed race' or multiraciality that has grown exponentially in the USA and the UK over the past two decades. However, it also departs from this scholarship’s tendency to focus exclusively on the topics of identity formation and racial classification on government forms. Instead, utilizing the timely case of President Obama -'the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas'- the book examines what Jolivette terms ‘mixed race hegemony’, the assertion that 'biracial and multiracial individuals and families will lead to the end of a race-conscious and racially-discriminatory society in the United States'. Overall, many race scholars, likely, will find Jolivette’s concept of ‘mixed race hegemony’ a more contextualized alternative to broader terms like ‘colour-blindness’ in the critical examinations of multiraciality.

The discussion is set within a national context where children of African Caribbean origin are one of the lowest achieving minority ethnic groups in the UK and are disproportionately one of the highest ethnic groups of children excluded from school. The parents recount a pattern of cumulative negative experiences which for many of the children results in academic underachievement and becoming demotivated to learn, by a system that they feel has rejected them, or imposed exclusion. The story is hardly new but it provides important further evidence that schools need to tackle head-on factors such as low teacher expectations and negative stereotyping of young black people and their contribution to black underachievement.

The book draws us into a thought-provoking journey that engages readers with the key participants and their immediate and extended families. The main purpose of the book was to present an ethnographic longitudinal analysis of how white members of mixed-race families in the Midlands of the United Kingdom deal with race, racism, whiteness and racial identity. This book explores the thinking and the discourses of white women who have established families with black Caribbean men. The book begins with the introduction of two new theoretical concepts: racial literacy and ethnic capital. It goes on to describe how the women in the longitudinal study cope with racism, how their thinking about race and whiteness has been challenged and changed over time, how their whiteness can be viewed either as a social liability or as a source of injury to their families and how they raise their ‘trans-racial’ children to become racially literate.

Abstract = {We assessed reported communication with HIV providers about reproductive plans among HIV + men in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and factors associated with having had such communication. A total of N = 311 HIV + men (18– 50 years) receiving HIV care at one of six public primary care clinics in Rio de Janeiro between 2008–2009 were surveyed. We used descriptive statistics, and multivariate logistic regression to identify factors associated with communication about childbearing with an HIV provider. HIV + male patients (mean age = 42.7 years, 57% mixed race; 23% bisexual, 51% married/committed partner, 61% with at least one biological child, 77% on ART) reported accepting attitudes of HIV and childbearing (51%), the desire (39%), and/or intention (19%) to have a future child, and reported communication with the HIV provider (14%) or their primary partner (28%) about having children. There were no significant differences between the responses of HIV + heterosexual and bisexual men on the above outcomes. Men who discussed childbearing with their HIV provider were more likely to have accepting attitudes about HIV and childbearing [AOR 2.8, 95%CI (1.2–6.4), p = 0.014], and intend to have a child [AOR 2.6, 95% CI (1.2–5.6), p = 0.018], but less likely to have discussed this topic with their partner [AOR 0.32 (0.15–0.68), p = 0.003]. Among men reporting communication, 40% (17/42) reported advice against having a child. An unmet need for collaborative, nonjudgmental, and provider-initiated communication about childbearing goals exists for HIV + men in clinical care.

Results: during the study period, 307 cases of AIDS were reported among people 50 years of age or oven There was a predominance of males (205/66, 8%), mixed race, and low education levels. The municipalities with populations above 100 thousand inhabitants reported 58.5% of the cases. There was a progressive increase in cases among women; an increasing trend in the incidence (positive linear correlation); and an advance in the geographical spread of the disease, with expansion to the coastal region and to the interior of the state, reaching municipalities with populations below 30 thousand inhabitants. In some locations the risk of disease was 100 times greater than the relative risk for the state.

Abstract = {This four-volume set, The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination, takes a fresh look at that issue that is embedded in today's global environment. Images, attitudes and perceptions that sustain prejudice and discrimination are more covert, but no less pernicious. What people say, believe, and do all reflect underlying bias. We do not claim here to address every existing form of prejudice or discrimination, nor do we cite every possible group targeted today. What we offer are insights into a range from the most to least recognized, or openly discussed, forms of this injustice. Each chapter offers new perspectives on standing issues, with practical information about how to cope with prejudice and discrimination. The "toolbox" at the end of each chapter suggests steps to be taken at different levels to combat prejudice and discrimination and to achieve change. At the individual level, self-reflection needs to occur by both the victims and perpetrators of discrimination. Practitioners, educators, and all who deliver services potentially impart a bias perpetuating prejudice and discrimination. At the systems level, communities and policymakers must join together and have the will to combat discrimination. Volume 1, Racism in America, looks at stereotypes, racial bias, and race relations. Volume 2, Ethnicity and Multiracial Identity, looks at discrimination toward differences due to immigration, language, culture, and mixed race. Volume 3, Bias Based on Gender and Sexual Orientation, looks at gender bias, women's issues, homophobia, and oppression of gay/lesbian lifestyles. Volume 4, Disability, Religion, Physique, and Other Traits, strives to examine less-spotlighted bias against other forms of difference, and begins the difficult dialogue that must take place if we are to eradicate prejudice and discrimination.

Abstract = {Marital isonymy is frequently used to estimate inbreeding and the repeated pairs method is useful to investigate whether the population under examination has subdivisions. These methods can also be applied to registers, such as population censuses, where both spouses' surnames are noted. In this paper, the 1795 census for Córdoba province is analysed. Numerically speaking, Spanish and mixed-race people are the major ethno-social groups in the register. In order to estimate inbreeding, the isonymic method was applied to both groups, at provincial and at parish level. To appreciate to what extent the parishes were genetically isolated, Wright's Fst was also calculated. The repeated pairs method was also used for both groups to assess if population subdivision existed in the units under study. Finally, to evaluate whether the subdivision based on surnames reflected the ethno-social stratification, the same method was used considering the two groups together. At the provincial scale, both groups displayed low inbreeding and micro-differentiation, although the former was higher for the Spanish and the latter for mixed-race groups, which could indicate a more marked conjugal selectivity in the Spanish. At the parish scale, preferences for isonymic spouses were not pronounced either in Spanish or in mixed-race groups; in the Spanish group population subdivision prevailed, with the opposite occurring in the mixed-race group. The estimations from repeated pairs, taking the two groups together, indicated that for the studied populations the surnames do not allow the two groups to be differentiated into isolated reproductive units.

Abstract = {Three studies examined the implicit evaluative associations activated by racially-ambiguous Black–White faces. In the context of both Black and White faces, Study 1 revealed a graded pattern of bias against racially-ambiguous faces that was weaker than the bias to Black faces but stronger than that to White faces. Study 2 showed that significant bias was present when racially-ambiguous faces appeared in the context of only White faces, but not in the context of only Black faces. Study 3 demonstrated that context produces perceptual contrast effects on racial-prototypicality judgments. Racially-ambiguous faces were perceived as more prototypically Black in a White-only than mixed-race context, and less prototypically Black in a Black-only context. Conversely, they were seen as more prototypically White in a Black-only than mixed context, and less prototypically White in a White-only context. The studies suggest that both race-related featural properties within a face (i.e., racial ambiguity) and external contextual factors affect automatic evaluative associations.

Abstract = {Multiracials have the flexibility to opt out of multiracial identity, to shift identities depending on context, and are characterized by in-group diversity. Given this fluid space, how do multiracials come to see themselves as a collective? This article describes an empirical example of collectivization processes at work. Specifically, the author observed the process of collective identity-building through ethnographic research in a mixed-race student-run organization. This case study indicates that group identity formation is a negotiated process involving strategies to achieve a sense of belonging and cohesion. The author shows that over time, by using experiences of social conflict to construct shared experiences, the members of this mixed-race organization developed collective identity. In so doing, their experience underscores how collective identity development is socially constructed and how micropractices are essential components of group formation.

Abstract = {Observed the tendency of shoppers at a suburban shopping mall to walk between conversing Black, White, or mixed-race male dyads. Both male and female shoppers (N = 508, 93.7% White) were more likely to walk through the Black dyad than through the White or the mixed-race dyads. Results are interpreted as indicating a relative lack of consideration for the Black dyad's interaction territory. When walking around a mixed-race dyad, shoppers more often chose to pass behind the White member. Findings suggest that the often subtle effects of racial attitudes can be studied unobtrusively using the invasion of shared space paradigm.

Abstract = {The complexity of the concept of identity confounds the interactions that we as humans have with one another. In reality, we are not one dimensional, but multidimensional beings. Individual characteristics, family dynamics, historical factors, and social and political contexts all influence who we believe ourselves to be. In this chapter, we examine ethnicity as a separate construct from race, although related, along with how it impacts the workforce. Although there are other dimensions of our being that also blend with our race and ethnicity, making up our total being—gender, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, abilities versus disabilities, and religious or spiritual beliefs—ethnicity is generally understood as a "fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common or national tradition".

Abstract = {Evidence indicates that superior memory for own-group versus other-group faces (termed own-group bias) occurs because of social categorization: People are more likely to encode own-group members as individuals. The authors show that aspects of the perceiver’s social identity shape social attention and memory over and above mere categorization. In three experiments, participants were assigned to a mixed-race minimal group and showed own-group bias toward this minimal group, regardless of race. Own-group bias was mediated by attention toward own-group faces during encoding (Experiment 1). Furthermore, participants who were highly identified with their minimal group had the largest own-group bias (Experiment 2). However, social affordances attenuated own-group bias—Memory for other-group faces was heightened among participants who were assigned to a role (i.e., spy) that required attention toward other-group members (Experiment 3). This research suggests that social identity may provide novel insights into person memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

We exposed Whites to racially ambiguous Asian/White biracial faces and measured the perceived similarity between Asians and Whites. We found that exposure to racially ambiguous, biracial-labeled targets may improve perceptions of intergroup similarity, but only for Whites who are less racially identified.

Abstract = {Background/Context: The history curriculum is often used to help reach the goal of racial tolerance and understanding by teaching about the nation’s diversity. Many educators believe that teaching about diverse peoples in schools will bring about greater equity in society. This historical study looks at the segregated American South from 1928 to 1943 and an effort by a mixed-race voluntary organization to teach Black history in White schools. Focus of Study: This study examines the efforts of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation (CIC), beginning in 1928, to promote the teaching of Black history in southern segregated schools in an effort to bring about greater racial tolerance and awareness. The CIC circulated a booklet, which was a short history of African Americans titled “America’s Tenth Man,” and invited schools to submit essays on Black history for cash prizes. The contests ran from 1928 until 1943, when the CIC was renamed the Southern Regional Council, which reflected a change in the organization’s emphasis on regional planning. Research Design: This is a historical examination of teaching Black history in segregated schools. The author relies on primary sources—including teachers’ reports, correspondence, and students’ projects—and secondary studies in the history of education and the curriculum. Conclusions: By challenging historians’ views of the CIC—that the organization was largely ineffectual and that its Tenth Man contests did not result in any measureable improvement in race relations in the South—the author raises questions about the implementation of Black history curricula in order to influence students’ behavior and attitudes about race. Likewise, the author shows how White teachers were outspoken activists for Black history in schools. The study concludes that the teaching of Black history to White students was not uniform and was ideologically diverse. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Purpose: South African adolescents have high HIV risk, yet few prevention interventions are effective. Parents play a pivotal role in youths’ healthy sexual development and may be at risk themselves. We tested whether Let’s Talk!, a worksite-based parenting program, improves parent-child communication about HIV and sexual health and parent condom use self-efficacy and behavior. Methods: We culturally adapted Let’s Talk! in two languages, drawing on formative research and community stakeholder input. We then conducted a small randomized test at a large public worksite in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention consisted of 5 weekly 2-hour group sessions for parents of youth aged 11-15. Sixty-six parents (64% female) and their 64 adolescents (41% female) completed surveys before and 1-2 weeks post-intervention; surveys assessed comfort with talking about sex, communication about 16 HIV- and sex-related topics, and parents’ condom use self-efficacy and behavior. Thirty-four Black African (Xhosa language) and 32 coloured (mixed-race; Afrikaans language) parent-child dyads participated. Parents were randomized to intervention (n = 34) and control (n = 32) groups; randomization was stratified by language. Results: Multivariate regressions indicated that the intervention significantly increased parents’ comfort with talking to their adolescent about sex, b(SE) = .98(.39), p = .02, and the number of sex-and HIV-related topics discussed with their adolescent, b(SE) = 3.26(1.12), p = .005. Compared with control parents, intervention parents were more likely to discuss new sex- and HIV-related topics not discussed before the intervention, b(SE) = 2.85(.80), p <.001. The intervention significantly increased parents’ self-efficacy for condom use, b(SE) = .60(.21), p = .007. Conclusions: Let’s Talk! holds promise for improving parent-child communication, a critical first step in preventing HIV among youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study examined client and program factors predicting initiation and engagement for 2,191 adolescents at 28 outpatient substance abuse treatment sites implementing evidence-based treatments. Using Washington Circle criteria for treatment initiation and engagement, 76% of the sample initiated, with 59% engaging in treatment. Analyses used a 2-stage Heckman probit regression, accounting for within-site clustering, to identify factors predictive of initiation and engagement. Adolescents treated in a pay-for-performance (P4P) group were more likely to initiate, whereas adolescents in the race/ethnicity category labeled other (Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian, mixed race/ethnicity), or who reported high truancy, were less likely to initiate. Race/ethnicity groups other than Latinos were equally likely to engage. Among White adolescents, each additional day from first treatment to next treatment reduced likelihood of engagement. Although relatively high initiation and engagement rates were achieved, the results suggest that attention to program and client factors may further improve compliance with these performance indicators.

Abstract = {Brazil’s extensive Atlantic coastline has profoundly influenced the nation’s history, serving as the initial locus for colonial settlement, and, subsequently, the site for almost all its major cities. Rio de Janeiro has long been the nation’s dominant international tourist destination. While Carnival remains the city’s most popular event, Reveillon, the New Years Eve celebration on Copacabana beach in honor of the sea goddess, Iemanjá, has become a major tourist draw. A familiar personage in Brazilian popular culture, Iemanjá is a major deity in African-Brazilian religions. African and African-Brazilian beliefs, historically associated with lower class and mixed race peoples, were long scorned by Brazilian elites as the superstitious practices of ignorant people. The majority of practitioners of African-Brazilian religions in contemporary Brazil are lower class and visibly of mixed race. The Reveillon evokes and com modifies Brazil’s preferred national image as a multicultural, multiracial democracy free of the Western stain of racism. As such, the celebration serves as a confirming ritual for Brazilians while, at the same time, packaging and presenting that image to tourists.

Abstract = {Black beauty shame emerges within the Black/white binary because of the beauty values sedimented in our structure of feeling since African enslavement. This article does not start from white beauty as the ideal, but focuses on the performativity of Black beauty shame as it transforms or intensifies the meanings of parts of the body in Jamaica and its UK diaspora. Using extracts from interviews with UK Jamaican heritage women, the discussion illustrates how Black beauty shame produces such intensification. First, where white beauty is iconic and reproduces the Black other as ‘ugly’, and second, where the Black ‘mixed race’ body is constructed as ‘other’ because of Black Nationalist discourses on beauty. The women’s critique of the shaming event shows that shame is undone through dis-identification as speakers draw on alternative beauty discourses to produce new beauty subjectivities. Dis-identification illustrates the transformational potential of shame as new Black beauty positionings emerge within the diaspora, drawing on beauty ideologies and models from Jamaica and thus destabilising the Black/white binary.

Abstract = {Purpose: To explore differences and similarities in environmental, personal, and behavioral factors influencing eating behavior among low-income women of varying weight status. Design: Focus groups (n = 16) were used to collect qualitative data. Quantitative data collected included demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric (heights and weights). Setting: Community centers, libraries, and homeless shelters in low-income neighborhoods. Participants: Of the 83 participants, 58 % were African-American, 28 % were white, and the remainder were American Indian, Hispanic, or mixed race. A total of 35% of participants were lean/normal (body mass index <25 kg/m²) and 65 % were overweight/'obese (body mass index >25 kg/m²). Method: Focus group methodology was used to collect data on 83 participants. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) provided the theoretical basis. Transcripts were analyzed using the open-coding method and comments between lean/normal and overweight/obese women were systematically compared. Results: Focus group themes were food environment, aberrant eating behavior, health values, and beliefs. Differences in personal and behavioral factors were apparent between overweight/obese and lean/normal women, with the former group frequently discussing emotional eating, overeating, and stashing food, and the latter group communicating greater nutrition knowledge and describing regular physical activity. Both groups similarly expressed experiences with food insecurity and lived in low-income environments. Conclusion: For low-income women, personal and behavioral factors may modify the influence of their obesogenic food environment. Further research within the context of SCT should examine differences between lean/normal and overweight/obese women living in the same environment.

Abstract = {Preparing healthy community members with timely communications prior to engaging them in a request to donate biospecimens promises to improve the experience of biobanking participation. To this end, a qualitative study was conducted to assess community member knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and informational needs about cancer-related biospecimen collection in a large metropolitan area in southwest Florida. The study utilized purposive sampling techniques to recruit a total of 95 participants to participate in 12 focus groups, segmented by race/ethnicity and language preference (mixed race, African American only, and Spanish speaking) and age (18–29, 30–54, and 55 and older). Focus group interviews were analyzed using content analysis to identify emergent themes. Overall, participants in the 30 years and older groups were favorable toward participating in biobanking if their concerns were addressed, such as confidentiality and consent issues, in contrast to participants aged 18–29 who were more skeptical. For all participants, the desire to participate in research that seeks new cancer treatments outweighed mistrust. Moreover, many cited the potential scientific benefit for future generations as a primary motivator. Finally, in some groups a therapeutic misconception was expressed, where participants expressed a willingness to forego confidentiality of their health status in exchange for therapeutic benefit. This study contributes to the literature on community perceptions of the benefits and barriers of biobanking and adds to the development of meaningful education communication priming tools to advance understandings about biobanking.

Abstract = {Cautions against the risks of metaphorical imperialism in readings of codified gay and lesbian representation. The author disagrees with M. Foucault's (1978) view that the secret of the 19th century was the secret of sex, and suggests that, in 19th-century American culture, where African-American identity and equality were among the most controversial issues, the secrets of identity were also secrets of race. Because scientific and literary representations of pathological and/or secret essential identities are sites of intersection in the discourses of homosexual and mixed-race identity, they should be investigated as intersections, rather than read as codifications of sexual difference. A survey of the discourses of scientific racism, genetics, and eugenics suggests that F. E. Harper's (1892 [1987]) representation of the mulatto leader can be read as an act of resistance to the representation of the mulatto as a degenerate, hybrid species.

Keeping with the format traditionally used in the American Psychological Association (APA) videotape series, the video is essentially divided into three sections. The didactic portions of the video are conducted through dialogue between Root and her host, Jon Carlson. Root begins by explaining the necessity for a clinical framework for clients with mixed-race identities, and she explains the conceptual framework she developed to meet the unique needs of this client group. Root then carries out a practice session with a client, which is followed by commentary on various portions of the session that provide context for important considerations when working with clients from this population.

Abstract = {Objective: To determine whether physicians who interact with their patients between office visits using secure messaging and phone provide better care for patients with diabetes when controlling for physician, patient and care center characteristics. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States. Participants: 174 Primary Care Physicians. Intervention: We modeled the relationship between communication via secure messaging or phone communication and Diabetes Recognition Program (DRP) scores with a Generalized Estimating Equations model. Covariates included physician age and panel size, patient age, race, income and number of comorbidities, and the population density around the care center. Main Outcome Measure: DRP scores. Results: Physicians whose patients were predominantly white or mixed race were more likely than other physicians to use secure messaging and phone with their patients between visits, but there was no significant association between such contacts and DRP scores (P > 0.1). In contrast, physicians with predominantly black or Hispanic patients had significantly higher DRP scores associated with the use of secure messaging (P < 0.01) and higher, though not statistically significant, DRP scores associated with the use of phone (P < 0.1). These associations were strongest for outcome measures such as HbA1c and lipid levels, and were weaker or nonexistent for process measures such as annual foot and eye exams. Conclusions: The use of secure messaging, and, to a lesser extent, phone, appears to be associated with higher quality diabetes care, particularly among at-risk populations.

Abstract = {We tested relationships between social connections, hope, and violence among young adolescents from socially distressed urban neighborhoods, and examined whether relationships between adolescents’ family and school connectedness and violence involvement were mediated by hopefulness. Data were from middle school students involved in the Lead Peace demonstration study. The sample (N = 164) was 51.8% female; 42% African American, 28% Asian, 13% Hispanic, and 17% mixed race or other race; average age was 12.1 years; 46% reported physical fighting in the past year. In multivariate models, parent-family connectedness was protective against violence; school connectedness was marginally protective. Hopefulness was related to lower levels of violence. The relationship between school connectedness and violence was mediated by hopefulness; some evidence for mediation also existed in the family-parent connectedness and violence relationship. Findings warrant continued exploration of hopefulness as an important protective factor against violence involvement, and as a mediator in relationships between social connections and violence involvement.

Abstract = {We estimated the prevalence of conscious risk, specifically defined as unprotected anal intercourse with an HIV-serodiscordant partner, and identified individual-level and partnership-level predictors of this behavior. Conscious risk was estimated to be practiced by 4.8% of HIV-negative MSM and 15.7% of HIV-positive MSM over a six-month period (p < 0.01). Among HIV-negative MSM, episodes of conscious risk were estimated to be more frequent among individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 (compared to those 55 years of age or older), among African Americans and Whites (compared to Latinos and Asians), individuals earning less than 10,000 dollars per year (compared to those earning 50,000 and 70,000 dollars per year), and among users of methamphetamine, downers, pain killers, and amyl nitrate (poppers). Among HIV-positive MSM, episodes of conscious risk were more frequent among Whites and Asians (compared to those of "other" races, i.e., those of mixed race, or those who did not exclusively self-report as White, Black, Latino, or Asian), those with full-time employment (as opposed to those with part-time employment), those earning between 30,000 and 50,000 dollars per year or 70,000 dollars per year or greater (compared to those earning under 10,000 dollars per year), and recent users of poppers. Conscious risk was more frequently reported in partnerships with large age gaps and in main partnerships (as opposed to casual or exchange partnerships). Individuals at high risk for conscious risk may be ideal candidates for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Examined, in 2 experiments, the effects of beneficiary–victim status and race on the reactions of 173 4th and 5th graders to an inequitable allocation. In Exp I, mixed-race dyads of Black or White Ss were subjected to profitable or unprofitable inequity by Black or White allocators. Ss were then allowed to request portions of a 2nd reward and were interviewed to assess inequity distress and their cognitive reactions to the experience of being a beneficiary or victim. Allocator's race was found to have a significant impact on the efforts of Black victims to redistribute rewards and to be relevant to all Ss' perceptions of the inequity. Ss' race and beneficiary–victim status influenced their interpretations of the initial allocation and the amount of distress experienced. Exp II examined the impact of race of observer and participant on observers' perceptions of an inequitable allocation. Overall results confirm the pervasive and complex impact of racial identity on reactions to inequity, pointing to its influence even on persons who have nothing tangible to gain or lose by their ratings and allocations.

Abstract = {I use multiple perspectives on the racial order in the United States to generate hypotheses about the social position of mixed-race groups. Perspectives that view the racial order as binary, ternary with an undifferentiated middle, or ternary with a stratified middle present different expectations for the social position of multiracial groups. I use a group’s level of residential segregation as an index of social position. In 2000, multiracial persons lived in neighbourhoods that were more white than the neighbourhoods of single-race minorities, though more diverse than the neighbourhoods of whites. Thus, multiracial groups appear to occupy an intermediate social position relative to blacks and whites, a finding that supports contemporary arguments about shifting colour-lines in the United States and the emergence of a triracial system of stratification. Yet, findings also suggest that the social space between blacks and whites is, itself, racially stratified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {American Indians occupy a singular position in U.S. society, unlike that of any other racial or ethnic minority group, by virtue of having been the first people to occupy the land that is now the United States. Their unique relationship with the federal government has grown out of a long history of conflict and struggle. This unique relationship stems from the fact that in the early history of the United States, American Indians were not considered a part of the nation. From 1790 to 1871, the federal government dealt with American Indians much as it would with foreign nations, using a mixture of diplomacy, treaties, and warfare. By the late nineteenth century, the federal government had successfully overwhelmed American Indians' military resistance and had turned to the task of assimilating them into modern society. The campaign to assimilate American Indians lasted throughout much of the twentieth century. However, the failure of these efforts, combined with increasing American Indian opposition, led the federal government to abandon them in the 1960s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the federal government gradually replaced the old assimilationist policies with new ones that allowed self-determination. Despite their special status, American Indian/Alaska Natives are among the poorest of the poor in the United States. And like other disadvantaged groups in the nation, a disproportionate number of American Indian/Alaska Native children live in homes at the very bottom of this hierarchy. The subject of this essay is twofold. One is to outline the social and economic position of American Indian/Alaska Native children relative to other, better-known groups, namely Whites and African Americans. These two groups represent polarities of privilege in American society, and juxtaposing American Indian/Alaska Native children against them is a means for gauging more clearly their position in American society. However, to fully understand the place of American Indian/Alaska Native children, it is especially important to understand who is being depicted as an American Indian or Alaska Native in statistical data from sources such as the Decennial Census. As the data presented below will show, there are at least two ways that data for American Indians can be presented and, indeed, they depict two rather distinct communities: one is a mixed race, mostly urban, and less disadvantaged group, and the other group is poorer, more rural, and less inclined to identify with any other race than American Indian or Alaska Native. If there is a single lesson that can be taken away from this essay, it is the remarkable diversity that exists within the population of people who represent themselves as American Indian/Alaska Natives. The complexity of the American Indian/Alaska Native population makes broad generalizations difficult. Yet this complexity underscores the vibrancy and diversity of Native communities.

Abstract = {Background: Injection drug users (IDUs) are at risk of acquiring HIV through injection and sexual practices. Methods: We analyzed data collected in five U.S. cities between 2002 and 2004 to identify correlates of HIV infection among 3285 IDUs ages 15–30 years. Results: Overall, HIV prevalence was 2.8% (95% CI 2.3–3.4), ranging from 0.8% in Chicago to 6.3% in Los Angeles. Mean age was 24 years, 70% were male, 64% non-Hispanic (NH) white, 7% NH black, 17% Hispanic, and 12% were other/mixed race. HIV infection was independently associated with: race/ethnicity (NH black [AOR 4.1, 95% CI 1.9–9.1], Hispanic [AOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5–8.4], or other/mixed [AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1–5.2] vs. NH white); males who only had sex with males compared to males who only had sex with females (AOR 15.3, 95% CI 6.8–34.5); injecting methamphetamine alone or with heroin compared to heroin only (AOR 4.0, 95% CI 1.7–9.7); reporting inconsistent means of obtaining income compared to regular jobs (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1–4.8); and having a history of exchanging sex for money/drugs (AOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5–5.2). Conclusions: More than two decades after injection and sexual practices were identified as risk factors for HIV infection, these behaviors remain common among young IDUs. While racial/ethnic disparities persist, methamphetamine may be replacing cocaine as the drug most associated with HIV seropositivity. HIV prevention interventions targeting young IDUs and address both sexual and injection practices are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Jobs, social group memberships, or living arrangements lead many people to interact every day with another person from a different racial background. Given that research has shown that interracial interactions are often stressful, it is important to know how these daily interactions unfold across time and what factors contribute to the success or failure of these interactions. Both members of same-race and mixed-race college roommate pairs completed daily questionnaires measuring their emotional experiences and their perceptions of their roommate. Results revealed that roommates in mixed-race dyads experienced less positive emotions and intimacy toward their roommates than did roommates in same-race dyads and that the experience of positive emotions declined over time for ethnic minority students with White roommates. Mediation analyses showed that the negative effects of roommate race were mediated by the level of intimacy-building behaviors performed by the roommate. Implications for future research and university policies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

This book is an outstanding collection of essays that brings together scholars from the United States and the United Kingdom to offer analysis on a wide range of topics from Pan-Africanism to mixed-race identity in the 20th century. The essays are linked through common themes of resistance and struggle against White racism, marginalization, and racial discrimination. The author defines Black as persons/groups who can claim African heritage throughout the world. Although he refuses to be labeled an essentialist, the author takes pains to argue that there is an “essence” to being of African descent in the 20th century. Therefore, the contributors openly discuss the commonality of experiences that Black people have had throughout the various social histories of the United States and the United Kingdom. This offering is a much-needed vehicle for African-centered voices to the discourse on Black identity in the 21st century. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {After the completion of the first circumnavigation of the globe by Magellan in 1521, the cultural gaze of Europeans was widened through the notion of" discoverie," and the interconnectedness of the new capitalist world-system saw the Portuguese become the first European presence in a global web linking Portugal with Africa, the Americas, and Asia. The largely male encounter with the "other" inevitably led to the proliferation of travel narratives that attempted to make sense of the place of interracial intimacy as part of the discourse of a new world system. The imperial canon in numerous global contexts provides us with ample evidence to suggest that the European male encounter with the sensual and exotic "other" was often translated as a sexual encounter with indigenous women in which the project of commercial conquest and the acquisition of female bodies were symbolically intertwined with each other. Ann Stoler has argued, the politics of mixed race and the social categorization of mixed-race children constituted a social and political space where the colonial state sought to enforce categories of rule. Ann Stoler points out, "mixedness itself was a moving and strategic category," and different imperial projects produced a range of contested responses to mixedness across time, space, and location. This essay addresses this valuable point from two different angles in view of the fact that there has been surprisingly little attention to the moving category of whiteness in the context of early colonial India. In this essay, the author suggests that both gender and religion were important "political rationalities" that shaped the contours and meaning of whiteness in the discursive space of colonial India in different ways in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By focusing on the cultural dialogue between English and Portuguese colonialisms, the author charts how the role of Catholic Portuguese Eurasian women can illuminate these rationalities through the lens of intimate relationships that were deeply implicated in the politics of colonial knowledge.

Rather than emphasizing movement toward autonomy and self-sufficiency, it focuses on the power of connection in people's lives. Culture and power are seen as formative in individual and social development. As a model, RCT is ideal for work with couples: it encourages active participation in relationships, fosters the well-being of everyone involved, and provides guidelines for working with disconnections and building relational resilience. Creating Connection helps readers to understand the pain of disconnection and to use RCT to heal relationships in a variety of settings, including with heterosexual couples, stepparents, lesbian and gay couples, and mixed race couples. In addition to an emphasis on helping couples find authentic connection, RCT points to the need for changing the cultural conditions that contribute to the problems of disconnection.

Abstract = {In this chapter "Southern Africa" is restricted to South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. South Africa has 90% of this region's population; the other three countries are incorporated into the South African economy by their overwhelming dependence on bilateral trade and by longstanding patterns of labor migration. This chapter does not consider fathering among the original foraging or hunter-gathering population, who were by the time of European settlement restricted to areas too dry for cattle-herding or cultivation. Nor is it much concerned with fathering among the white population, for whom aspirations and institutional arrangements concerning family life are relatively similar to those in Western Europe and North America. This chapter focuses on the behavioral patterns and problems of fathering among the 45 million black Africans who make up 81% of the population of the region. Unless otherwise specified, references to men, women, families, and population are restricted to black Africans. South Africa's population is 9% white and 11% "other" (mostly "coloured" or mixed race, or of South Asian ancestry), and the percentage of the population that is black in Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland are 97%, 99%, and 97%, respectively. The national population of South Africa is 49 million; of Botswana and Lesotho it is 2 million each; and of Swaziland it is 1.35 million. In the regional map, the names of ethnic groups are indications of the areas of their greatest concentration; all the peoples of the region are now widely distributed. Southern African cultures include important roles for men in the lives of children even though the care of young children is seen as women's responsibility within a gendered division of labor and social activity. In a system of distributed or collective fatherhood, the father is one of several men expected to contribute to a child's well-being and fathers are expected to play a role in the lives of children other than their own offspring. More than a century of white domination, labor migration, and racial segregation have separated families. Social policy and cultural attitudes increasingly emphasize financial support as the central aspect of adequate fathering, but massive unemployment and economic inequality make it impossible for many fathers to provide financial support to their children. Families and governments must acknowledge and encourage the many non-financial ways that men can contribute to the lives of children. This chapter includes the following elements: 1) A case story of a specific father(s); 2) Cultural and historical influences on fathering; 3) Comprehensive review of fathering research in the target culture(s) or region; 4) Social policy issues related to fathering; 5) Sub-cultural variations in fathering; 6) Contemporary social/economic conditions that affect fathering; 7) Speculation, predictions for the future, and comparisons with fathers in other societies.

Abstract = {This study explores how religious congregations interact with other community organizations to address health and, in particular, HIV-related needs within their membership and/or local communities. Case study data from a diverse sample of 14 urban congregations (6 Black, 4 Latino, 2 White, and 2 mixed race-ethnicity) indicate that they engaged in three types of relationships to conduct HIV and other health-related activities: (a) resources flowed to congregations from external entities, (b) resources flowed from congregations to external entities, and (c) congregations interacted with external entities. These types of relationships were present in roughly equal proportions; thus, congregations were not primarily the recipients of resources from other organizations in these interactions. Financial, material, and human capital resources were shared across these three relationship types, and the most common organization types that congregations were involved with for health efforts were prevention and social service organizations, health care providers, and other congregations. In addition, congregations tended to have more collaborative relationships with other faith-based organizations (FBOs) and tended to engage with non-FBOs more to either receive or provide resources. Results suggest that congregations contribute to community health by not only sponsoring health activities for their own members but also by providing specific support or resources to enhance the programming of other community organizations and collaborating with external organizations to sponsor congregation-based and community-based health activities.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Raising Brooklyn: Nannies, Childcare, and Caribbeans Creating Community by Tamara Mose Brown (2011). Tamara Mose Brown’s new book, continues with this high-quality research and extends the analysis to new spheres. The author, a graduate student and mother of toddlers when she did the research, conducted participant observation and interviews over a period of 3 years with 25 West Indian nannies in a gentrifying neighborhood of Brooklyn. She also interviewed 10 employers of nannies, but we don’t hear too much about them. The author grew up in a Trinidadian immigrant household, and identifies as mixed race; yet she recognizes that like many of the West Indian immigrant nannies she studied, she is racially identified by others as black. All of the research subjects worked as live-out nannies in the neighborhood where the author lived as a resident, and the park benches in the local public parks provide one of the main places of study. This is a rich book. The study is beautifully observed, written in a calm affect, hitting the right pitch. We sociologists don’t usually evaluate this aspect of writing, but tone sets the scene for both ethnographic description and analysis. This book shows an important part of urban life in Brooklyn that goes beyond the media’s glossy portrayal of Brooklyn as iconic hipster neighborhood.

Abstract = {Background: South Africa’s Western Cape has experienced a dramatic increase in methamphetamine (“meth”) use over the past decade. There is concern that meth may further fuel the HIV epidemic in this country because of its association with risky sexual behaviors. This study describes the prevalence of meth use and its relation to HIV sexual risk behaviors among patrons of alcohol-serving venues. Methods: Participants (N = 3328) were surveyed in 12 venues in a mixed race township. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relations between meth use and sexual risk behaviors, and structural equation models were used to test whether meth use mediates the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and current sexual risk. Results: Meth use in the past 4 months was more common among Coloured than Black persons (10.5% vs. 3.5%). Meth users were more likely than non users to use marijuana, inhalants, and injection drugs, have a history of childhood sexual and/or physical abuse, and experience and/or perpetrate intimate partner violence. Among both men and women, meth use was associated with greater odds of engaging in sexual risk behaviors, and meth use partially mediated the relationships between childhood sexual abuse and all sexual risk behaviors. Conclusions: Meth users in this setting are at increased risk for HIV due to their greater likelihood of engaging in sexual risk behaviors and being in violent relationships. There is an urgent need to provide targeted HIV prevention and substance abuse treatment to meth users living in townships in Cape Town. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Introduction: As all published measures of dependence for users of smokeless tobacco (dippers) have poor reliability, in the present work the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) and the Autonomy Over Smoking Scale (AUTOS) were evaluated for use with this population. Dippers and smokers were also compared in relation to dependence, the pleasure derived from using tobacco and the latency to the onset of withdrawal. Methods: In 2010, an anonymous self-completed paper survey was administered to 1541 students of mixed race and ethnicity in grades 9-12 (mean age 15.9 years) in a Florida high school where students used cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Results: The reliability (Cronbach’s α) for the HONC was 0.90 for smokers (n = 139) and 0.91 for dippers (n = 85), and for the AUTOS was 0.94 for smokers and dippers. Dippers and smokers did not differ significantly in relation to scores on the HONC, AUTOS, latency to withdrawal onset or pleasure derived from smoking. One or more symptoms on the HONC were reported by 56% of dippers and 57% of smokers with <100 lifetime uses of their favoured tobacco product, and by 91% of dippers and 91% of smokers with ≥100 lifetime uses (not significant). Greater lifetime use was associated with a significantly shorter latency to withdrawal for smokers and dippers. Conclusions: The HONC and AUTOS are highly reliable measures of dependence for adolescent users of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Using these measures and other indicators, no meaningful differences in dependence were found between dippers and smokers at comparable levels of lifetime use.

Abstract = {New York's urban neighborhoods are full of young would-be emcees who aspire to "keep it real" and restaurants like Sylvia's famous soul food eatery that offer a taste of "authentic" black culture. In these and other venues, authenticity is considered the best way to distinguish the real from the phony, the genuine from the fake. But in Real Black, John L. Jackson Jr. proposes a new model for thinking about these issues--racial sincerity. Jackson argues that authenticity caricatures identity as something imposed on people, imprisoning them within stereotypes: an African American high school student who excels in the classroom, for instance, might be dismissed as "acting white." On the other hand, sincerity, as Jackson defines it, imagines authenticity as an incomplete measuring stick, an analytical model that attempts to deny people agency in their search for identity. Drawing on more than ten years of ethnographic research in and around New York City, Jackson offers a kaleidoscope of subjects and stories that directly and indirectly address how race is negotiated in today's world--including tales of book-vending numerologists, urban conspiracy theorists, corrupt police officers, mixed-race neo-Nazis, and gospel choirs forbidden to catch the Holy Ghost. Jackson records and retells their interconnected sagas, all the while attempting to reconcile these stories with his own crisis of identity and authority as an anthropologist terrified by fieldwork. Finding ethnographic significance where mere mortals see only bricks and mortar, his invented alter ego Anthroman takes to the streets, showing how race is defined and debated, imposed and confounded every single day.

Abstract = {Objective: We do not know how racial composition of a group influences behavior change for African Americans (AAs) in group-based weight loss programs. We tested the hypothesis that AA who participate in all AA weight loss intervention groups will lose more weight than AA who participate in mixed race groups. Methods and Procedures: This observational study was ancillary to Phase 1 of the Weight Loss Maintenance Study, a multi-center trial of strategies to maintain weight loss after a 20-week behavior modification program. Three of four centers recruited several all-AA intervention groups. Remaining groups were combinations of AA and non-AA participants. All participants received the same weight loss intervention. Change in weight was the primary outcome, comparing participants of all-AA groups with AA participants of mixed race groups conducted by the same AA interventionists. Secondary outcomes included measures of intervention adherence and behavior change. Results: Participants of all-AA groups (n = 271) were comparable to other AA participants (n = 106). The mean proportion of AA in mixed race groups was 56%. All-AA group participants had similar weight loss as those in mixed groups (-4.2 vs. -4.2 kg, P = 0.97). There were no differences between the groups in mean number of sessions attended or changes in dietary intake. Discussion: Significant weight loss was observed in both groups, with no effect of group composition on adherence or weight loss outcomes. Special logistics to accommodate all-AA groups may not be necessary. Despite varying instructional environments, AA appeared to respond positively to intervention messages with significant changes in dietary intake, physical activity (PA), and weight.

Abstract = {When the words ‘identity’ or ‘community’ are evoked, a homogenizing process forms for the sake of community coherence. This article is based upon interviews with nine bisexual and mixed race participants about their conceptualization of identity-based communities. All participants expressed discontent with the ‘established’ gay and lesbian community for being monolithically White in racial composition and also biphobic. More than one half of the participants had been involved in queer Asian American women’s organizations, within which they felt the least conflict and the most inclusion. The ideals of identity-based organizations have only sporadically manifested themselves for the bisexual-biracial women who are otherwise marginalized, silenced or excluded. Because their diverse needs and identities are not represented within these organizations, many of the participants felt they gave more than they received. Finding that communities based upon narrow identity clusters were not ideal, the participants created diverse communities based upon their expanded interests and identities. These bisexual-biracial women have revolutionized their personal concepts of community as they integrated the ideals of identity politics yet moved to include individuals who share similar progressive politics, responsibility and acceptance.

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine if spatial access to healthy and unhealthy outlets comprising the local food environment was associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Population-based sample residing in Hawaii. Subjects: Three hundred and eighty-four adults (36% Asian-American, 33% non-Hispanic white, 31% other/mixed race). Measures: A spatial model of the local food environment was constructed using radial buffers extending from participants' place of residence. Fruit and vegetable intake was estimated using the National Cancer Institute Fruit and Vegetable All-Day Screener. Analysis: Mean intakes of fruits and vegetables were compared for spatial access to total, healthy, and unhealthy food outlets at distances of .5 to 3.5 km. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate differences in fruit and vegetable intake for residing further from a food outlet or for residing in an area with a greater number of food outlets. Results: Residing in an area with a greater density of total or healthy food outlets was associated with a higher mean intake of fruits and vegetables (p < .05) at .5 km. No differences in mean intakes were detected for distances beyond .5 km or for regression models. Conclusion: Findings suggest that greater spatial accessibility to food outlets comprising the local food environment in Hawaii may not be meaningfully associated with fruit and vegetable consumption; however, associations were detected for the smallest spatial scale examined, warranting further investigation.

Black girls had significantly higher mean body mass index (BMI) values than either White or mixed race girls. Controlling for differences in BMI, White girls scored significantly higher on the BSQ than did mixed race or Black girls, whereas no ethnic differences were found for EAT scores. A comparable percentage of Black, mixed race and White girls had scores indicative of eating disorder pathology on the EAT, while a higher percentage of White, compared to mixed race and Black, girls had abnormal scores on the BSQ. The ideal body size desired by White girls was significantly smaller than that of the mixed race or Black samples.

Abstract = {Although multiple race responses are now allowed on federal censuses and surveys, most interracially married single-race parents report a single race for their children. It is well-established that the social context of these racial identification decisions affects their outcome. This research focuses instead on the physical context. It is argued that homelands—physical places with cultural meaning—are an important component of the intergenerational transfer of a single-race identity in indigenous mixed-race families. To test potential explanations for the relationship between homelands and indigenous identities, this research focuses on families in which an interracially-married American Indian lives with a spouse and child and was included in the Census 2000 5% Public Use Microdata Sample. Logistic regression reveals a strong effect of living in an American Indian homeland on the child’s chances of being reported as single-race American Indian. This effect remains even after accounting for strong ties to American Indians and other groups, family and area poverty levels, geographic isolation, and the racial composition of the area. The intergenerational transmission of strong identities continues in this multiracial era (as it has for centuries) in the context of culturally meaningful physical places.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Black Beauty: Aesthetics, Stylization, Politics by Shirley Anne Tate (2009). This book seeks to counter representations that depict black women as 'dupes of patriarchy and racism' who lack beauty agency and 'yearn for whiteness'. This book maintains that through stylization black women are ‘expanding the boundaries of what counts as black beauty', rather than 'inscribing a white aesthetic onto their bodies'. The book argues that 'Black mixed race' women use fake tan to become 'browning'. While their behavior mimics that of white people who wish to be brown, she suggests that the young women do not want to be white, rather, through fake tanning they ‘radically revalue dark skin positively' and subvert ‘the colonial priority of "race" in which white was right'. Perhaps the most controversial points the book makes are about skin bleaching. The book challenges the tendency for black women's beauty work to be automatically associated with a desire to be white. The book also problematizes the invisibility of politics in white women's beauty work and urges readers to consider the 'race' work inherent in white women’s beauty practices. The concludes that a non-essentialist, inclusive black politics is required that 'disrupts white supremacy's light skin privilege which seeks to place darker-skinned, kinkier-haired women outside of beauty itself'.

Abstract = {As he took the stage with his family on election night, the crowd rose in unison in Grant Park in Chicago. Many will never forget that image of the first African American striding to the podium to deliver his presidential acceptance speech before 250,000 joyful and tearful souls. Barack Obama had just been elected the 44th president of the United States. Older members of the crowd uniformly expressed their disbelief: "I never thought I would ever see in my lifetime a black man elected to be president of the United States." Despite what appeared to be overwhelming odds when he announced his candidacy for president 21 months earlier, Barack Obama had ascended to the most powerful position in the world. Many of the elders in the crowd had witnessed the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King on their grainy black and white television sets in 1968. They had seen news clips of Bull Connor and his police attack dogs in Birmingham, Governor George Wallace blocking the schoolhouse door to desegregation at the University of Alabama, Rosa Parks's refusal to be seated in the rear of the bus, the Watts Riots, and civil rights marches on Washington in the late 1960s. It's no wonder they couldn't conceive of Obama's ascent to power that night, a man who represented a culture and a race that had been oppressed since the origins of North American slavery in 1619. As biographers write of Obama's life, the term "resilience" will emerge as a predominant characteristic that helped carry him to a position of prominence on the world stage. Pundits will offer their opinions about how his sense of determination shaped his personality. They will reread and analyze Obama's books Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope in order to gain insight into the part of his personality that provided him with a venue for overcoming all odds. Obama clarifies in his autobiographical works the many struggles and obstacles facing a young man of mixed race without a father. In many ways, Obama's overall life serves as a symbol of the successful negotiation of cultural, racial, and gender dilemmas that young men confront on their path to adulthood. Obama's story symbolizes resilience at its best. This chapter discusses challenges in counseling young men, strengths-based approach to psychotherapy with adolescent boys, understanding a father's absence, crossing the bridge into manhood, and the audacity to believe.

Abstract = {This article uses the Hapa movement as a case study in order to provide a framework for understanding identity as a goal of social movements and to expand on a theoretical understanding of multiracial social movements. In contrast to current understandings of identity-based movements, this article argues that the Hapa movement seeks simultaneously to deconstruct traditional notions of (mono)racial identities and to secure recognition for a multiracial “Hapa” identity. Movements that have identity as a goal are motivated by activists’ understandings of how categories are constituted and how those categories, codes, and ways of thinking serve as axes of regulation and domination. The Hapa movement simultaneously challenges (mono)racial categories at both the institutional level through targeting the state and at the micro level through challenging the quotidian enactment of race and promulgating a Hapa identity. Activism by mixed-race individuals and organizations constitutes an important challenge to power that has significant implications for racial categorization and classification in contemporary American society.

Abstract = {During a period of unprecedented ethnicity data collection in Britain, an almost universal characteristic of this practice has been the mandated use of the decennial census ethnicity classifications. In Canada and the USA a greater plurality of methods has included open response, now recommended for the 2020 US Census. As the ethnic diversity of Britain has increased, driven by immigration dynamics and population mixing leading to 'superdiversity', the census is no longer able to capture the new populations. The validity and utility of unprompted open response is examined in several 'mixed race' datasets. It is argued that open response can be a modus operandi for large-scale ethnicity data collection and that the lack of consistency in recording of such responses need not necessarily be viewed as a drawback. Open response offers substantial insights into the country's superdiversity in a way that ethnicity categorization alone cannot. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Handbook of race, racism, and the developing child edited by Stephen M. Quintana and Clark McKown (see record [rid]2008-00226-000[/rid]). The title of their book is apt because the chapters in this book deal with two overlapping topics: (a) children's recognition and self-identification of race and (b) the formation of racial attitudes and the influence of racial bias on children's development and adjustment. Although most of the chapters in this book focus on these topics with respect to children in the United States, researchers' work from Australia, Canada, England, Israel, and the Netherlands is also included. Likewise most of the emphasis is on African Americans, although several chapters address how these topics apply to Latinos, Asian Americans, and those of mixed race. The first half of the book describes and attempts to explain the changes in children's thinking about race, racism, and racial attitudes. The second half of the book examines the outcomes of race and racism in such areas as mental health, academic achievement, and occupational aspirations. This is a good source book for those who want to read the latest thinking and research on race, racism, and children. Thus it will primarily appeal to researchers and graduate students.

Though no concrete numbers exist for children's mortality rates in New Spain, child sickness and death most likely formed an integral part of family and community life in Latin America throughout the colonial period. This chapter analyzes family and community responses to sick children through miraculous healing accounts, where children on the brink of death became healed through what those involved described as divine intervention. Such accounts contain detailed descriptions of children's illnesses, along with family and community healing strategies taken over the course of the sickness.

Abstract = {Objective: Explore how urban and rural Minnesotans access the food system and to investigate whether community infrastructure supports a healthful food system. Design: Eight (4 urban and 4 rural) focus groups were conducted. Setting and Participants: Eight counties with urban influence codes of 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10. Fifty-nine (urban, n = 27; rural, n = 32) adults. The sample was of mixed race and had a range of incomes. Almost half of the sample was obese. Main Outcome Measure: Food systems access and the role of community infrastructure, civic engagement, and reciprocal relationships in food provisioning in counties with different urban influence codes. Analyses: Themes and subthemes were identified through emerging concepts. Results: Food access varied based on rurality and community infrastructure. Three themes emerged: community infrastructure around the conventional food system and food provisioning, alternative food resources, and perceptions of the effect food and of the influence diet and exercise have on health. Conclusions and Implications: Civic engagement and community infrastructure affected food access. Rural residents rely more on retail grocery stores, gardening, hunting, and informal food exchange systems, whereas urban residents rely more on the retail grocery stores and food safety net systems. Hunting and gardening may contribute valuable nutrients to the diet. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

It also explores feelings of professional exclusion despite being the recipient of a privileged Northern hemisphere education and shows how the topic of restitution addresses some of the inherent tensions in my personal life, whilst offering potential for redemptive North-South partnerships. Moreover, researching restitution in global contexts of moral injustice, across the Global North–South divide, has the potential to expand the internationalisation of scholarship on morality and moral education.

We integrated an evidenced-based motivational interviewing (MI) approach with a social network component to develop a 20-minute session, a social network intervention delivered in an MI-consistent style. Female adolescents (N = 28) 14 to 18 years old were recruited, provided consent/assent, were screened, and were randomly assigned to the treatment or control (no treatment) condition. The sample was 82% African American and 18% mixed race, with 32% living below the U.S. poverty line. At 1-month follow-up, teens in the treatment condition reported less trouble due to alcohol use, less substance use before sexual intercourse, less social stress, less offers for marijuana use, and increased readiness to start counseling compared with the teens in the control condition.

Abstract = {Jeffrey Passel surveys demographic trends and projections in the U.S. youth population, with an emphasis on trends among immigrant youth. He traces shifts in the youth population over the past hundred years, examines population projections through 2050, and offers some observations about the likely impact of the immigrant youth population on American society. Passel provides data on the legal status of immigrant youth and their families and on their geographic distribution and concentration across the United States. He emphasizes two demographic shifts. First, immigrant youth—defined as those children under age eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents—now account for one-fourth of the nation’s 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children. Second, the wave of immigration under way since the mid-1960s has made children the most racially and ethnically diverse age group in the United States. In 1960 Hispanic, Asian, and mixed-race youth made up about 6 percent of all U.S. children; today that share is almost 30 percent. During that same period the share of non-Hispanic white children steadily dropped from about 81 percent to 56 percent, while the share of black children climbed very slightly to 14 percent. By 2050 the share of non-Hispanic white children is projected to drop to 40 percent, while that of Hispanic children will increase to about one-third. This changing demographic structure in U.S. youth is likely to present policy makers with several challenges in coming decades, including higher rates of poverty among youth, particularly among foreign-born children and children of undocumented parents; high concentrations of immigrants in a handful of states; and a lack of political voice. A related challenge may be intergenerational competition between youth and the elderly for governmental support such as education funding, Social Security, and government health benefits. In conclusion, Passel notes that today’s immigrants and their children will shape many aspects of American society and will provide virtually all the growth in the U.S. labor force over the next forty years. Their integration into American society and their accumulation of human capital thus require continued attention from researchers and policy makers.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine low-income mothers’ perceptions of their children’s height and weight in relation to actual measures, and perceptions of dietary quality and health status. Demographic, anthropometric, and dietary quality/health status data were collected during a multi-phase nutrition research project with low-income Minnesotans, and a sub-set of non-pregnant mother–child dyads (mothers ages ≥ 18 years, children ages 9–13 years) were analyzed (n = 257). Participants were Caucasian, African American, American Indian, Hispanic, Asian, or Other/mixed race, and most were homeless. Relationships between maternal perceptions of their child’s height and weight and the actual measures, and maternal perceptions of dietary quality and health status for the dyad, were examined using independent and paired samples t-tests, ANOVA, and paired samples correlations. Comparisons were also made by maternal and child body mass index (BMI) status and living situation. Mothers significantly underestimated their child’s height and weight (−4.8 ± 13.9 cm, P = 0.000; −5.3 ± 8.5 kg, P = 0.000); greatest misperceptions of weight were among mothers of overweight/obese children (P = 0.000). Mothers not reporting estimates of their child’s height and weight (n = 53) had higher BMIs (P = 0.029), and their children were younger (P = 0.000) and lighter (P = 0.021) compared to mothers who provided estimates. Inability to objectify children’s weight status may contribute to the obesity epidemic affecting low-income minority populations. Underestimation of weight status may be influenced by cultural perceptions of body image and socioeconomic status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We propose that hypodescent—the assignment of mixed-race individuals to a minority group—is an emergent feature of basic cognitive processes of learning and categorization. According to attention theory, minority groups are learned by attending to the features that distinguish them from previously learned majority groups. Selective attention creates a strong association between minority groups and their distinctive features, producing a tendency to see individuals who possess a mixture of majority- and minority-group traits as minority-group members. Two experiments on face categorization, using both naturally occurring and manipulated minority groups, support this view, suggesting that hypodescent need not be the product of racist or political motivations, but can be sufficiently explained by an individual’s learning history.

Furthermore, we tested whether concern about appearing prejudiced and prior knowledge of the topic predicted role adopted. Results confirmed that African Americans adopted a ‘teacher’ role whereas Whites adopted a ‘learner’ role during interracial discussions about race. Assuming a teacher role predicted greater willingness to engage in future interracial discussions about race; but Whites, who were concerned about appearing prejudiced when talking about race, were less likely to adopt a teacher role than African Americans.

Using pooled clinical data collected with the Global Assessment of Individual Needs, we identified racial/ethnic and other factors associated with co-occurring internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and the combination thereof in adolescents in federally funded treatment facilities. Results show that after controlling for demographic and socio environmental factors, African Americans, Hispanics, and mixed-race adolescents were more likely than Whites to have co-occurring internalizing problems. African Americans and Native Americans were less likely than Whites to have externalizing problems and to have combined internalizing and externalizing problems. Presence of co-occurring problems was also associated with victimization, homelessness, and family substance abuse. These results indicate that co-occurring mental health problems vary by race/ethnicity, and therefore, refined approaches are needed for culturally appropriate care of patients.

HDW measures included experiences and perceptions of sexual harassment (SH) and generalized workplace harassment (GWH), and perceived harassment or discrimination because of race or ethnicity. Prevalence was examined by sex, race, age, occupation, marital status, and education. Effects of HDW were assessed controlling for demographics and job and life stressors. Experiencing multiple types of HDW was common. SH was more prevalent among women, and Blacks and those of other or mixed race or ethnicity experienced the highest levels of HDW overall. HDW variables explained additional variance in problem drinking and mental health beyond life and job stressors, particularly for women. This study demonstrates that HDW is a prevalent problem associated with poor mental health and problem drinking in the U.S. workforce. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {South Africa is a remarkable mosaic of human society on the most Southern tip of Africa. Here, in an area roughly eight times the size of Belgium, live some 30 million people, comprising Whites, Coloreds (persons of mixed race), Asians and no fewer than 10 indigenous African tribes, of which the Zulus is the largest. The population is not only diverse, but it is also exploding. In the past two decades, the population has more than doubled from 13 million in 1964 to its present 30 million. New levels of education are opening new career horizons for a large percentage of our people, but virtually the whole population is experiencing economic changes. In this dynamic environment where change is the order of the day, the organization development (OD) consultant in South Africa has a task which can only be described as very exciting. Our consultancy has been in existence since 1979. In the past five years (possibly the period of greatest change), we have been fortunate enough to become involved in many projects which have a direct bearing on the conditions of social, political and economic change in our society. We should like to share with you our involvement in a number of these areas. Our new constitution is giving additional political rights to many persons of coloured origin who have as yet only had political experience at local government level. In a country as diverse as South Africa, sound industrial relations systems are essential. It has also been proved that the approach to industrial relations in South Africa should be unique and not a duplicate of similar systems in the UK, Europe or the US, mainly due to its cultural composition and the many migrant workers from bordering countries. OD practice in South Africa is in an early phase and we are proud of our involvement in the development of OD practitioners and in the establishment of a network of OD practitioners in South Africa. For three years we have presented a program for internal OP consultants, consisting of six modules, extending from March to November each year. It is abundantly clear that the situation in South Africa today offers challenges to the organization practice (OP) consultant which are unique in the Western World. To be successful in this field and to make a constructive contribution as behavioral scientists we are dependent upon continuous interaction between ourselves and our colleagues in other countries.

Abstract = {Children Who Wait is the report of a study that was commissioned by the Association of British Adoption Agencies following concerns about the number of children in local authority care waiting for permanent families. The study sought to understand the reasons why so many children in local authority care were waiting for permanent families. Their study was concerned only with children in long-term care under the age of 11 and living apart from their parents. At the time of the study there was a cultural adjustment to the diminishing numbers of babies available for adoption. The study indicates that a larger proportion of children in residential care had parents who objected to foster care. One of the factors which determined a decision for children to remain in foster or residential care was the difficulty in placing sibling groups, children from "black" or "mixed race" families, and the view that, through adoption, children should lose all contact with their biological families. The authors also described the effect of changes of social worker on children, saying that 80% of the children had a change of social worker within a two-year period. Social work needs to be more valued and have the resources needed to draw on existing knowledge to ensure that they are able to meet the needs of children who are waiting for them to act.

Abstract = {Classic minimal-group studies found that people arbitrarily assigned to a novel group quickly display a range of perceptual, affective, and behavioral in-group biases. We randomly assigned participants to a mixed-race team and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify brain regions involved in processing novel in-group and out-group members independently of preexisting attitudes, stereotypes, or familiarity. Whereas previous research on intergroup perception found amygdala activity—typically interpreted as negativity—in response to stigmatized social groups, we found greater activity in the amygdala, fusiform gyri, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsal striatum when participants viewed novel in-group faces than when they viewed novel out-group faces. Moreover, activity in orbitofrontal cortex mediated the in-group bias in self-reported liking for the faces. These in-group biases in neural activity were not moderated by race or by whether participants explicitly attended to team membership or race, a finding suggesting that they may occur automatically. This study helps clarify the role of neural substrates involved in perceptual and affective in-group biases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Little is known about the patterning of neighborhood characteristics, beyond the basic urban, rural, suburban trichotomy, and its impact on physical activity (PA) and overweight. Methods: Nationally representative data (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 1994-1995, n =20,745) were collected. Weight, height, PA, and sedentary behavior were self-reported. Using diverse measures of the participants' residential neighborhoods (e.g., socioeconomic status, crime, road type, street connectivity, PA recreation facilities), cluster analyses identified homogeneous groups of adolescents sharing neighborhood characteristics. Poisson regression predicted relative risk (RR) of being physically active (five or more bouts/week of moderate to vigorous PA) and overweight (body mass index equal or greater than the 95th percentile, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics growth curves). Results: Six robust neighborhood patterns were identified: (1) rural working class; (2) exurban; (3) newer suburban; (4) upper-middle class, older suburban; (5) mixed-race urban; and (6) low-socioeconomic-status (SES) inner-city areas. Compared to adolescents living in newer suburbs, those in rural working-class (adjusted RR[ARR]=1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.13-1.69), exurban (ARR=1.30, CI=1.04-1.64), and mixed-race urban (ARR=1.31, CI=1.05-1.64) neighborhoods were more likely to be overweight, independent of individual SES, age, and race/ethnicity. Adolescents living in older suburban areas were more likely to be physically active than residents of newer suburbs (ARR=1.11, CI=1.04-1.18). Those living in low-SES inner-city neighborhoods were more likely to be active, though not significantly so, compared to mixed-race urban residents (ARR=1.09, CI=1.00-1.18). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate disadvantageous associations between specific rural and urban environments and behavior, illustrating important effects of the neighborhood on health and the inherent complexity of assessing residential landscapes across the United States. Simple classical urban-suburban-rural measures mask these important complexities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Analyzed the factor structure of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) in 408 White, Black, Indian, and mixed race South African college students to see if the five-factor model can be recovered and determined the utility of the use of the test in South Africa and if a comparable factor structure can be recovered in White and Black South Africans. When the instrument was factor analyzed, the structure of the five-factor model was well reproduced for the entire sample as well as the White and Black subgroups. Parallel analysis indicated the appropriateness of the five-factor solution. Whereas the structure of personality was highly similar across race, there were statistically significant differences in mean scores of some domains and facets by race. The greatest difference was in Openness to Experience, particularly in the Openness to Feelings facet, with the White subgroup scoring relatively high, the Black subgroup scoring relatively low, and the Indian subgroup scoring in an intermediate range. The authors speculate that these differences are primarily the result of social, economic, and cultural differences between the races rather than the direct product of race itself.

Abstract = {The purpose of this interpretive descriptive study was to describe how eight Black-White couples with school-aged children constructed their interracial family identity through developmental transitions and interpreted race to their children. Within- and across-case data analytic strategies were used to identify commonalities and variations in how Black men and White women in couple relationships formed their family identities over time. Coming together was the core theme described by the Black-White couples as they negotiated the process of forming a family identity. Four major tasks in the construction of interracial family identity emerged: (a) understanding and resolving family of origin chaos and turmoil, (b) transcending Black-White racial history, (c) articulating the interracial family's racial standpoint, and (d) explaining race to biracial children across the developmental stages. The findings guide family nurses in promoting family identity formation as a component of family health within the nurse-family partnership with Black-White mixed-race families.

Abstract = {This article, which utilizes personal experience as well as other perspectives and theories on race and mixed race, suggests that multiracial identity is a manifestation of recent date that differs from traditional conceptions and descriptions of mixed race that conform to the dichotomous and hierarchical logic of the binary racial system. As delineated in this article, the emergence of multiracial identity is properly understood in the context of the post-civil rights era and has been coextensive with multiculturalism, the proliferation of information technologies, and with the emergence of the multiracial political movement in the 1990s. Further, this article suggests that multiracial identity is also in part a by-product of multicultural American universities of the 1980s and 1990s. That is, multiracial identity has to a certain extent taken shape in reaction to the rigid ethnoracial boundaries and discourses that are imposed on mixed race students in the multicultural academy.

Nonverbal communication patterns were coded and compared between the same-race and mixed-race groups. Results indicated that Black and White males were significantly different in their display of adaptors in the same-race groups. In part two, 40 Black and 35 White males completed the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA).

Abstract = {We aimed to assess prevalence and correlates of hazardous use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs in a primary care population in Cape Town, South Africa. Stratified random sampling was used to select 14 of the 49 clinics in the public health sector in Cape Town, and every "nth" patient, with those ages 18–25 oversampled (N=2,618). Data were collected from December 2003 through 2004, using the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test. Hazardous use of tobacco was most common, followed by alcohol and then other drugs. Hazardous tobacco use was associated with the 18–25 years age group, no religious involvement, high school completion, and higher stress. Hazardous alcohol use was associated with male gender, younger men, no religious involvement, employment, some high school education, and higher stress. Hazardous use of other drugs was associated with Colored (mixed) race (particularly among men), no religious involvement, employment, and stress. For all substances, women, particularly Black women, had the lowest rates of hazardous use. Although the study is cross-sectional, it does identify groups that may be at high risk of substance misuse and for whom intervention is urgent. Because prevalence of substance use is high in this population, routine screening should be introduced in primary care clinics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Between 1980 and 2000, residential segregation between non-Hispanic whites and blacks, as measured by the index of dissimilarity, declined by 8.7 percentage points. How this decline reflects stable racial integration at the neighborhood level remains to be seen. Using the Neighborhood Change Database, which provides 1980, 1990, and 2000 census-tract level data in 2000 boundaries, the descriptive analyses conducted here reveal three findings. First, the declines found in white-black segregation are due to increases in multiethnic neighborhoods rather than mixed white-and-black neighborhoods. Second, the decline in segregation appears not to be due to the fact that multiethnic neighborhoods are forming and remaining stable over time. Instead it is due to the increase in the number of these neighborhoods at one point in time. Finally, when focusing explicitly on the stability of mixed-race neighborhoods, such neighborhoods are less stable when examined over two decades as compared to one decade.

Abstract = {It is sometimes said that the most segregated time of the week in the United States is Sunday morning. Even as workplaces and public institutions such as the military have become racially integrated, racial separation in Christian religious congregations is the norm. And yet some congregations remain stubbornly, racially mixed. People of the Dream is the most complete study of this phenomenon ever undertaken. Author Michael Emerson explores such questions as: how do racially mixed congregations come together? How are they sustained? Who attends them, how did they get there, and what are their experiences? Engagingly written, the book enters the worlds of these congregations through national surveys and in-depth studies of those attending racially mixed churches. Data for the book was collected over seven years by the author and his research team. It includes more than 2,500 telephone interviews, hundreds of written surveys, and extensive visits to mixed-race congregations throughout the United States. People of the Dream argues that multiracial congregations are bridge organizations that gather and facilitate cross-racial friendships, disproportionately housing people who have substantially more racially diverse social networks than do other Americans. The book concludes that multiracial congregations and the people in them may be harbingers of racial change to come in the United States. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN), once thought to be a problem of wealthier, Western countries has now been documented in survey studies and case reports across geographic and economic groups; however, few epidemiological studies including interview have been done on these populations. We report on a comprehensive study on Curaçao, a Caribbean island in economic transition, where the majority of the population is of predominantly black African origin. As part of an epidemiological study on the island of Curaçao indigenous cases of AN were identified. Participants were interviewed and asked to complete standardized measures of eating behaviors and cultural attitudes. In addition, matched controls completed the same measures and were seen in a focus group to assess their knowledge of eating disorders and perceived current and future challenges to young Curaçao women. Six of the nine indigenous cases of AN were successfully traced; all were of mixed race. No cases of anorexia were found among the majority black population. The women with AN were from the high-education and high-income sectors of the society and the majority had spent time overseas. The women with a history of anorexia reported higher levels of perfectionism and anxiety than the matched controls. All of the women reported challenges to maintaining an active professional and personal life and viewed themselves as different from the norm. Women who presented with AN evidenced vulnerability to a triple threat to identity formation: (1) they were of mixed race, aspiring to fit into the mobile elite (and mostly white) subgroup while distancing themselves from the black majority; (2) they had the means for education and travel that left them caught between modern and traditional constructs of femininity; and (3) they had lived overseas, and therefore struggled upon reentry with the frustrations of what was possible within the island culture. The race, class and overseas exposures of the women with anorexia were anything but typical on the island. Cases of anorexia in other developing countries may similarly be limited to specific subgroups, which require specialized treatment and planning efforts.

Abstract = {Objectives: The primary goal of this article is to examine factors associated with grandparent care giving within the American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) population. Methods: Data from the 2000 Census of Population, 5% Public Use Microdata Sample, are used to evaluate a multivariate logistic regression model focusing on living with and caring for grandchildren. Particular emphasis is placed on characteristics that may reflect culturally-based ideas about grandparents' responsibility for the care of their grandchildren. Results: Indicators related to Native-American identity--specifically, reporting race as AIAN only rather than mixed race, reporting tribal membership, and living in a nonmetropolitan area of an "Indian" state--increase the likelihood of being responsible for a grandchild among Native-American singles and couples aged 45 and over. Conclusions: Cultural and resource characteristics combine to produce high levels of grandparent care giving within the AIAN population. Inasmuch as those with lower educational and economic resources are especially likely to have responsibility for a grandchild, special attention should be directed toward ensuring adequate support for these caregivers.

Abstract = {Used the Medical Outcomes Survey SF-36 instrument to determine if the quality of life (QOL) in males and females with HIV was affected by race, gender, or clinical stage of disease. Ss were 134 HIV outpatients (aged 20–40 yrs, 42 White, 49 Mixed race and 43 Black), who were referred to an HIV clinic in western Cape Town, South Africa, and 115 healthy, non-medical hospital personnel (36 Whites, 37 Mixed race, 42 Blacks). Scores on 8 QOL concepts were assessed. Black female controls scored significantly lower on all scales except physical function. HIV-infected Ss of Mixed race (both genders) reported poorer physical function; no other scale was affected by race. HIV Ss scored significantly lower on all scales; the majority of the decline in function occurred early in disease by WHO stages 1 and 2. It is concluded that HIV infection impacts early on all aspects of QOL and that this impact is largely independent of racial origin. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Male circumcision (MC) prevents HIV acquisition in males, leading to calls for extensive implementation in sub-Saharan Africa. The widespread adoption of male circumcision will require social marketing targeted at various families and family members. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the utility of conjoint analysis in the choice of social marketing strategies tailored to different populations to promote male circumcision in Johannesburg, South Africa. Seven social marketing strategies for MC were identified through open-ended interviews (n = 25). Preferences were assessed using conjoint analysis, implemented in a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected households. An oversampling strategy ensured balance between Blacks (34%), Coloreds (mixed-race; 32%), and Whites (34%). Respondents randomly received a block of 4 conjoint analysis tasks comparing 2 mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsets of the 7 strategies. Preferences were then evaluated using logistic regression stratified by ethnicity and family member. Whereas all strategies were attractive, television marketing, endorsement by church/school leaders, and a countrywide program were most preferred (p < .0001). Stratified analyses identified heterogeneity, e.g., only Coloreds valued radio (p < .0001) and a lasting presence in the community (p < .0001). Within families, mothers and sons were most concordant for Blacks (p < .05) and Coloreds (p < .01), but fathers were most concordant with sons among Whites (p < .05). Conjoint analysis provides valuable insight into preferences and can be used in the development of social marketing, especially when aimed at promoting behavioral change.

HIV prevalence was 12.1% overall and racial disparities in HIV prevalence were pronounced (range, 2.9% among non-Hispanic whites to 27.1% among non-Hispanic blacks). Risks independently associated with being HIV-positive were: being between 26 and 29 years of age, being non-Hispanic black or of other/mixed race, having had 20 or more lifetime male sex partners, having been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD), and not being currently enrolled in school. The majority of participants (78.9%) reported a prior HIV test. In multivariate analysis, being older, having had five or more lifetime male sex partners, having had anal intercourse with males, reporting an STD diagnosis, and reporting recent unprotected anal sex were associated with report of a prior HIV test. Prevention efforts must address high HIV prevalence among young non-Hispanic black MSM and must make testing and effective counseling for young MSM readily available.

Abstract = {Existing studies indicate that multiracial adolescents face greater substance use rates than monoracial adolescents. However, it is unclear whether the risk identified in adolescence persists into adulthood. The current study uses data from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey to analyze the alcohol and tobacco use of multiracial adolescents and adults compared to European American, African American, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander American, and Latino American individuals. Results generally support the hypothesis that multiracial adolescents and adults face higher rates of substance use than African American and Asian/Pacific Islander American individuals, though this pattern of results was reversed in comparison with Native Americans and European Americans, and less consistent compared to Latino Americans. We further establish and discuss the correlates of drinking and smoking behavior for mixed-race individuals—comparing them to other racial groups. We review the limitations of our design and the implications for future research on multiracial substance use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Participants were 2,193 mixed race adolescents (M = 14 years old) from 9 schools (4 intervention, 5 control) near Cape Town, South Africa. Students in the HealthWise school with the greatest involvement in teacher training and implementation fidelity reported increased intrinsic and identified motivation and decreased introjected motivation and amotivation compared to students in control schools. These results point to the potential for intervention programming to influence leisure motivation among adolescents in South Africa and represent a first step toward identifying leisure motivation as a mediator of program effects.

Abstract = {Objectives: We sought to determine the preventive healthcare needs of incarcerated women in the following areas: cervical cancer and breast cancer screening, sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening, hepatitis screening and vaccination, and smoking cessation. Methods: A cross-sectional interview survey of a random sample of 100 incarcerated women at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) in Cranston, Rhode Island, was conducted. Results: Participants were 62% white, 11% African American, 13% Hispanic, and 14% of mixed race. Mean age was 35 years. Of those surveyed, 67% reported having had a Papanicolou (Pap) smear in the past year, the strongest predictor of which was having received a Pap smear while incarcerated. Of the inmates >40 years old, 58% reported having had a mammogram in the past 2 years. The majority (88%) reported testing for STIs in the past, and 39% desired testing during their current incarceration. As for hepatitis C, 70% had been tested previously and 37% of those reported testing positive. Hispanics were less likely than whites to have been tested for hepatitis C (OR 0.1). Over half (54%) of the women who reported testing positive for hepatitis C also reported having completed the hepatitis A and B vaccine series. Among smokers (80% of all survey participants), 61% were interested in quitting. Those who had been incarcerated multiple times were less likely to want to quit smoking (OR 0.1). Conclusions: Incarceration presents a unique opportunity to provide preventive healthcare to high-risk, medically underserved women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {According to the 2010 U.S. census, approximately 9 million individuals report multiracial identities. By the year 2050, as many as one in five Americans could claim a multiracial background. Despite this population growth, a review of recent empirical and theoretical literature in social work suggests a disproportionate lack of attention to issues of multiraciality. Instead, social work practice models remain embedded in traditional societal discourses of race and culture that often exclude or marginalize the experiences of multiracial individuals and families. This article summarizes recommendations following the domains of awareness, knowledge, and skills in the NASW Standards for Cultural Competence in Social Work Practice to support culturally attuned social work practice with multiracial people. The authors argue that a culturally attuned practice approach—one that is inclusive of multiraciality—is not only timely, but also consistent with the profession’s ethical obligation to provide culturally relevant services to all consumers and clients.

Participants were presented with faces lying at various locations on mixed-race continua (i.e., Caucasian-North African and Caucasian-Asian faces were used as source images in a morphing program). In all studies, the prevalence of exclusive ethnic features in a face distorted participants' recollections of the face toward faces more typical of the category. Specifically, the recollection of 30% North African (or 30% Asian) faces shifted toward Caucasian source faces, whereas the recollection of 70% North African (or 70% Asian) faces shifted toward North African (Asian) source faces. Memory distortions did not emerge for extremely ambiguous (50%) faces and proved larger on mixed-race than same-race continua (Studies 3 and 4). Memory distortions also emerged with high levels of confidence. The authors elaborate on the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

Abstract = {White slavery narratives--stories about white women forced into prostitution--played an important role in the construction of racial distinctions in the early twentieth century. New York City politicians launched a well-publicized anti-vice crusade in 1910 that led to the imprisonment of a mixed-race woman named Belle Moore. In this article, I analyse this event to show the importance of sexuality and gender for creating racial boundaries. Testimony in People vs. Belle Moore designated certain intimacies as violating the color line, thereby clarifying what it meant to be 'White' or 'Colored'. I argue that theories of racial formation must include a more careful consideration of gender and sexuality because the ongoing maintenance of racial categories depends upon cultural narratives about sexual deviance and purity.

Abstract = {In this article I examine how a so-called "bush" college designated under Apartheid for the education of Coloured (mixed-race) students contributed to the radicalization of South Africa's Western Cape region. The creation of the University of the Western Cape (UWC) was part of an Apartheid divide and rule strategy to inhibit the development of political alliances between mixed-race and indigenous African peoples. However, in 1982, UWC rejected the use of Apartheid classifications for selecting entrants, thereby establishing the country's first non-racial, open admissions policy. UWC paid a price for its principled efforts, as the Apartheid regime slashed state subsidies and engaged the institution in a protracted legal and ideological struggle over the right to determine its own educational policies. Viewing UWC's transformation as microcosm of the country's negotiated settlement to end Apartheid, the article concludes with a critical discussion of Coloured identity and the limits of democratic reform in post-Apartheid South Africa.

Results show that EAT scores were significantly higher for Asians and Muslims and for mixed-race Ss than for White or African Caribbean Ss. Adjusted odds ratios for having a very high EAT score were 2.4 in Asians and Muslims and 2.9 in mixed-race Ss, compared to White Ss. Having only one parent employed was also independently associated with a very high EAT score, compared with having both parents employed. Similar associations were found for a moderately high EAT score and for a combination of low self-esteem and high EAT score. Low self-esteem and depressed mood were independently associated with a high EAT score. Overall, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, self-esteem, and depression, but not gender, were independently associated with eating attitudes. It is stated that effects of cultural and socioeconomic stresses on eating disorders may be mediated through depressed mood and low self-esteem.

The correlation coefficients obtained for the South African groups were compared to those Griffiths obtained in her work with the British standardization sample of the Griffiths Scales. The pattern of correlation for South African and British subjects was found to be similar. This suggests that the Scales are measuring a construct which is consistent across cultures and through time. A factor analysis was performed with the data for each South African ethnic group separately and the factor solutions were compared to determine whether the Griffiths Scales measure similar or different constructs for the groups. The results indicate that the Griffiths Scales tend to measure one factor, and including only common variables, the factor appears to be similar cross-culturally.

Abstract = {This study was conducted to assess the food and macronutrient consumption patterns of Head Start preschool children and their body weight status. Three data collections were conducted over 15 months with 125 children attending either morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) sessions. Sample portions from Breakfast (B), Lunch (L), and Snack (S) were photographed and weighed; individual student’s plates were photographed and plate waste was both photographed and weighed; consumption and nutrient content for each meal ⁄child ⁄day was calculated using Nutritionist Pro v. 14.0. Over half of the subjects (52%) were female; 50% were Caucasian, 22% were African American, 10% were Hispanic, and 18% were Other, primarily of mixed race. The mean age was 5 months, average height and weight were 107.9 cm and 19.3 kg, respectively; the mean BMI was 16.5 kg ⁄m2. Most (58%) of the children were Normal weight status, 19% were Overweight, and 18% were Obese; 20% of the males were Obese compared to 16% of females. Energy (kcal) and protein (g) offered was: B = 219 and 9; L = 353 and 17; S = 126 and 3; amounts consumed were B = 136 and 5; AM-L = 239 and 12; PM-L = 192 and 9; and S = 110 and 3. AM and PM children obtained only 22% and 18% of their daily energy requirement, respectively, while protein intakes were 2–3 times higher than the recommended one-third RDA. Children in the AM session had significantly higher nutrient intakes than those in the PM session. Children preferred energy-dense and familiar foods; acceptance rates for fresh fruit (33%–42%), raw vegetables (22%–29%), and cooked vegetables (15%–34%) were low. Food consumption patterns may be regulated by familiar foods and home food preferences. Preschool programs need to offer nutritionally balanced, palatable, and attractive meals and learning activities focused on increasing students’ acceptance of unfamiliar foods, especially fruits and vegetables.

Abstract = {As soon as the authority of the Public Health and Welfare Section (PHW) of the Supreme Commander for Allied Powers waned in May 1951, the Japanese government overturned several measures it had implemented. Although the PHW contributed greatly toward improving public health conditions, not all of its activities were models of cooperative success. Many Japanese perceived some measures—terminated pensions for wounded Japanese veterans, lack of support for segregated orphanages for mixed-race children, and suppression of Japanese atomic bomb medical reports—as promoting US national interest at the expense of Japanese public health needs. Similarly, the PHW’s upgrade of nursing education and separation of the professions of medicine and pharmacy were reversed because neither professionals nor the public saw these measures as urgent. Their reinstitution toward the end of the twentieth century suggests that the progressive measures were sound, but broke too sharply with Japanese tradition and were enforced prematurely.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Racial union: Law, intimacy, and the white state in Alabama, 1865-1954 by Julie Novkov (2008). Novkov views bans on interracial intimacy not as a legacy of a bygone era but as a key resource in state-building. Limiting her scope to the development of a single state on a single issue provides a focused lens to track the life of the law and its use in constructing a regime of white supremacy. Novkov steps out of the periodization in one chapter to capture a pattern in white masculinity in the period 1914–1944. White men who bequeathed property to their children were faced with the consequences of anti-miscegenation laws when their bequests to their mixed-race children were called into question. By narrowing her scope to one state and one legal construct, Novkov produces a history of the opportunities and challenges involved in state-building.

Abstract = {Background: The epidemiology of DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is not well characterized in developing country settings. In South Africa, given the high rates of violence and trauma, there is particular interest in traumatic exposures as potential risk factors for IED. Methods: We examined the prevalence and predictors of IED in a nationally representative sample of 4,351 South African adults. IED and other diagnoses based on DSM-IV criteria were assessed using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). A 28-item scale was constructed to measure exposure to traumatic events. Results: Overall, 2.0% of participants (95% CI: 0–4.9%) fulfilled criteria for the narrow definition of IED, and 9.5% (95% CI: 6.6–12.3%) fulfilled criteria for the broad definition of IED. Individuals with IED experienced high rates of comorbid anxiety, mood and substance use disorders compared to non-IED participants. In multivariate analysis, a diagnosis of IED was associated with Caucasian and mixed-race ethnicity, psychiatric comorbidity and exposure to multiple traumatic events. Conclusion: These data suggest a relatively high prevalence of IED in South Africa. By reducing violence and trauma, and by providing appropriate psychological support to trauma survivors, we may be able to reduce rates of IED.

Overall, Ss demonstrated generally positive attitudes toward aspects of their own culture and slightly favorable attitudes toward interracial tolerance. They also demonstrated a moderate to positive sense of similarity to other members of their own race. Several statistically significant differences between all the groups were found. Comparative analyses on identity and attitude variables performed with White American adolescents were also statistically significant for all groups.

Abstract = {Based on evidence from a French-Wolof phrase book published in Senegal in 1864, this article makes the case that urban Wolof, a variety of the language characterized by significant lexical borrowing from French, is a much older variety than scholars have generally claimed. Historical evidence suggests that urban Wolof emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries in the coastal island city of Saint-Louis du Sénégal, France's earliest African settlement and future capital of the colonial entity that would be known as French West Africa. The intimate nature of early contact between African and European populations and the later role played by the métis or mixed-race population of the island as linguistic brokers contributed to a unique, urban variety of Wolof that has important links to today's variety of urban Wolof spoken in Dakar and other cities throughout the country.

Abstract = {Historically, the principle of hypodescent specified that individuals with one Black and one White parent should be considered Black. Two experiments examined whether categorizations of racially ambiguous targets reflect this principle. Participants studied ambiguous target faces accompanied by profiles that either did or did not identify the targets as having multiracial backgrounds (biological, cultural, or both biological and cultural). Participants then completed a speeded dual-categorization task requiring Black/not Black and White/not White judgments (Experiments 1 and 2) and deliberate categorization tasks requiring participants to describe the races (Experiment 2) of target faces. When a target was known to have mixed-race ancestry, participants were more likely to rapidly categorize the target as Black (and not White); however, the same cues also increased deliberate categorizations of the targets as "multiracial." These findings suggest that hypodescent still characterizes the automatic racial categorizations of many perceivers, although more complex racial identities may be acknowledged upon more thoughtful reflection.

Abstract = {This paper looks at some of the problems concerning access of Black people to NHS Psychotherapy Departments. It examines some of the clinical issues that can arise in offering treatment to Black patients, including racism. It argues that in addressing these issues improvements could be made to services, so that Black people have a better and more equal chance (as compared to their White counterparts) of specialist psychotherapeutic help. The term 'Black' is being used in a broad context to signify different from white and to include African-Caribbean, Asian and mixed race people. These issues are inevitably emotionally charged and difficult to write about without stirring up uncomfortable feelings in the reader. As Bion (1962) understood, thinking is an emotional experience and, in thinking about race and inequalities in psychotherapy services, minus K can come into force--it can feel easier not to know. A clinical example is used to illustrate awareness of racism as an internal reality and that working with these issues helped to prevent the premature departure of a Black patient from therapy.

The author focuses his discussion on representations of race and seeks an analytic frame that avoids recreating the system it attempts to critique. He seeks to articulate a lens for explicating media that neither embraces racialization and racial divisions nor accepts a priori racial definitions that maintain existing hierarchies. After reviewing the predominant trends in research on media representations of race (good-bad representations, discrimination, pedagogy about race, audience reception, images and stereotypes, and uses and gratifications), he describes recent trends that examine Whiteness, diaspora, exhilic experiences, and "otherness." From these trends, he builds his discussion based on the assumption that media representations are sites of political contestation involving disparities of power. He is concerned about how media images participate in the construction of political realities in addition to reflecting social practice. He uses a text, Doubles, which problematizes binary, essentializing racial purity by focusing on bi- and mixed-race people to challenge images of racial purity and unpack the practice of substituting "American" for "White."

We use the 1990 US Census, which affords a unique look at racial identification because multiracial people were required to choose one race over another. The results show support for our argument that place plays a central role in Pacific identity processes, illustrated in this case among Hawaiians. We find that strong ties to Hawaii - the spiritual and geographic home of the Hawaiian population - are vital to the intergenerational transmission of Hawaiian identification in both continental and island multiracial families. We compare our results for multiracial Native Hawaiians to prior studies of American Indians and Asian Americans to identify any general patterns in correlates of racial identification choices. In each group, we find that familial and geographic relationships to the cultural and ancestral lands are strongly linked to racial identification.

Abstract = {We sought to determine the prevalence of HIV conspiracy beliefs in patients with HIV and how those beliefs correlate with access and adherence to HIV care and health outcomes. From March to December 2005, 113 patients at four public facilities in Houston, Texas, diagnosed with HIV for 3 years or less, participated in a cross-sectional survey. Conspiracy beliefs were assessed with five items that dealt with HIV origin, cure, and vaccine. Medical records were reviewed for CD4 cell counts, HAART use, and appointment dates. Statistical analyses (including analysis of variance [ANOVA], χ² testing, and regression) determined the predictors of conspiracy beliefs and correlated them with outcomes. Sixty-three percent of the participants endorsed 1 or more conspiracy beliefs. African American patients more often held HIV conspiracy beliefs than white and other/mixed race patients (73%, 52%, 47%; p = 0.045). Persons holding 1 or more conspiracy beliefs had higher CD4 cell counts at diagnosis (254 cells/mm³ versus 92, p = 0.03); and similar rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use (73% versus 71%), 100% adherence to HAART by self-report (53% versus 45%,), mean adherence by pharmacy refill (83% versus 87%), and gaps in care greater than 120 days (49% versus 53%), compared to subjects who did not hold any conspiracy beliefs (all p > 0.40). Since recruitment focused on patients in care, patients with extreme conspiracy beliefs may be underrepresented. Despite this, more than 50% of the study population endorsed 1 or more conspiracy belief. However, these beliefs did not negatively impact access or adherence to HIV care. Efforts to improve adherence to HIV care may not need to focus on eliminating conspiracy beliefs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Introduction: There is increasing awareness of the contribution of perceived social support (PSS) to emotional and physical well-being. Numerous scales measuring PSS have been developed, including the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The psychometric properties of the MSPSS have been demonstrated in diverse samples, although its reproducibility in the South African youth has not yet been investigated. Methods: This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the MSPSS in the South African youth using confirmatory factor analysis. The relationship of PSS to depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as the effects of sex and ethnicity, was investigated. Participants completed a battery of self-report measures, including the MSPSS, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist on a single occasion. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to validate the a priori factor structure of the MSPSS. In addition, Cronbach α coefficients and intercorrelations (for clinical variables) were calculated. A missing value analysis was performed to assess the influence of missing data on our findings. Results: Data are reported for 502 youth (11.3-23.5 years). The 3-factor structure of the MSPSS (significant other, family, and friends) fitted the data well. The MSPSS showed good internal consistency. Perceived social support was also positively correlated with resilience and negatively correlated with depression, exposure to community violence, and other potentially life-threatening traumas. Females and youth of white or mixed race reported significantly higher levels of PSS than males and black youth, respectively. Conclusions: The MSPSS is a psychometrically sound instrument that can be applied to South African youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

As slaves, "house negroes" were the psychologically dominated, mixed-race offspring of the antebellum master class. The political descendants of antebellum house negroes are today's Black Conservatives. Their political aspirations represent a corrupted version of the "American dream." In particular, those who are scholars take part in contrived research in their mandate to serve the political status quo.

The first prediction is that people of Mixed-Race average between the two parental populations. The second prediction is that the pattern of group means remains consistent over time and place.

Abstract = {Most child subjects of maltreatment reports to child protective services (CPS) are involved just once, whereas other children experience repeated investigations and victimizations. This study examines individual, maltreatment, and service-related factors associated with maltreatment rereporting and substantiated rereporting in a multistate context. Case-level National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System data (505,621 children) were analyzed. Within 24 months, 22% of children were rereported, and 7% were rereported with substantiation. Younger and White and mixed race children, those with disabilities, and those whose caregivers abused alcohol were more likely to be rereported and rereported and substantiated. Service provision, including foster care placement, was associated with increased likelihood of subsequent events. When CPS agency performance is assessed using measures of reentry, separate measures may be necessary for children who receive services, so that improvements in safety can be appropriately recognized. Rentry into CPS is a complex interaction of risks to children and systemic factors tied to the intervention they receive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Traditionally, the addiction literature has focused on white drug users and less attention has been given to users from ethnic minority groups. More recently, research investigating ethnic group differences in drug use and associated problem behaviors has emerged. This paper contributes to the growing research base by drawing on data collected from structured interviews with 4,631 arrestees conducted as part of the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (1999-2002) program. Clear ethnic group differences in drug use are identified. Arrestees who were white and of mixed race were found to be more serious drug users and to experience more associated problems than arrestees from other ethnic minority groups. The research and policy implications of the research are discussed and the study's limitations are noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to examine the factor structure of The Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC), an instrument designed to measure stress coping ability, in a sample of 701 South African adolescents. Confirmatory factor analysis failed to verify the original five-factor structure reported by Connor & Davidson, and an exploratory factor analysis suggested either a possible three-factor or two-factor structure in the current sample. Individual factor analyses by ethnicity suggested that the factor structure may differ among the different ethnic sub-groups. The reliability coefficient for the CD-RISC was 0.93. Age and ethnicity were the only demographic factors significantly correlated with CD-RISC scores. Age showed a negative relation to CD-RISC scores, and adolescents of black ethnicity had significant lower scores than their white and mixed race (coloured) counterparts. The CD-RISC scale could be a useful measure of resilience among South Africans, but future validation in South African populations is still needed.

Abstract = {Background: Increasing levels of youth obesity constitute a threat to the nation's health, and identification of the influences during childhood that lead to youth obesity is urgently needed. Physical activity is one such influence that is potentially modifiable. Purpose: This study examined the influence of children's social images of other children who engage in physical activity on the development of their own physical activity over 3 years and related growth in physical activity to levels of obesity 2 years later. Methods: Participants (N = 846, 50% female) were members of the Oregon Youth Substance Use Project, a longitudinal study of a community sample. The racial/ethnic composition of the sample was 86% Caucasian; 7% Hispanic; 1% Black; and approximately 2% each of Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Alaskan Native, and other or mixed race/ethnicity. The mean age at the first assessment was 9.5 years. A model examining the effect of early social images on the growth of physical activity (athleticism modeled as a curve of factors) predicting obesity was evaluated using latent growth modeling. Results: More favorable social images predicted the initial levels (i.e., intercept) but not the change over time (i.e., slope) of children's athleticism, and both the intercept and the slope of athleticism predicted obesity. Conclusions: Children's social images of exercise in early childhood influence their subsequent activity levels, and hence obesity, and should be targeted in obesity prevention interventions.

Abstract = {This qualitative analysis of interviews with women of Thai and non-Thai parentage throws into question the current celebration of Eur/asianness and multiraciality. The study describes multiracialisation as an ambivalent and differential process of categorisation which mobilises essentialist ideas of 'stock' and 'breeding'. A far cry from historical notions of 'mixed-race degeneracy', interviewees emerged from this process the 'best of both worlds'. However, beside the 'good mix' there ran the spectre of the 'bad mix', and some had more access to celebratory identities than others. Celebratory notions of Eur/asian femininity were further qualified by the competing discourse of the 'Thai prostitute'. The precariousness with which interviewees could access normative ideals of desirability was especially visible in narratives of masculinity, non-white parentage, gender variance and childhood. The article ends by advocating, in the place of a power-evasive celebration, challenges to the multiple overlapping power relations which underlie all acts of evaluation.

This article focuses on black beauty as performative through looking at how the discourse of dark skin equals black beauty is destabilized in the talk of 'mixed race' black women. A dark skin shade and natural afro hair become ambiguous signifiers as the women's talk leads to a mobility of black beauty. Their talk is thus an interception in which there can never be a definitive reading of black beauty while also pointing to the binaries of the black anti-racist aesthetics on which they draw. Thus, while women are rooted in racialized and racializing notions of beauty they expand the boundaries of the beautiful black woman's body. Black beauty as an undecidable resists binaries without ever constituting a third term and arises through the disidentification and shame of cultural melancholia.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, People of the Dream: Multiracial Congregations in the United States by Michael O. Emerson, with Rodney M. Woo (see record [rid]2006-07915-000[/rid]). According to the authors, those most likely to attend segregated churches are Blacks in rural churches, with lower-than-average educational levels (p. 162). Who attends racially diverse churches? The authors state that "people of mixed-race congregations are, on average, considerably different from other Americans" (p. 97), "people who seem to flow across racial categories and divisions" (p. 6). So much so, in fact, that Emerson invents a new term for them: "Sixth Americans" (p. 99) who do not fit socially into one of Emerson's five racial categories of Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American. Emerson is very clear that it is multiracial, not multiethnic, groups he is interested in. The book concentrates on Protestant churches, which is not surprising, given their marked differences in size and polity from Catholic churches. However, Catholic congregations pop in and out of the picture irregularly. Exactly where the Mormons, the fourth largest denominational group in the United States, fit in is unclear; aside from a passing reference to research on Black Mormons (p. 122) they do not appear. A graph concerning the relation between "level of market share" and "level of segregation" (p. 42) includes only the categories of Catholic, mainline Protestants, conservative Protestants, and non-Christians. The topic of multiracial congregations is certainly one worthy of research. A search of the Sommervogel Archive, a bibliography of over 60,000 in the social scientific study of religion (Donahue, 1999), produced only 10 relevant references when looking for the words racial, multiracial, or multi-racial in the title of dissertations, journal articles, and contributions to edited volumes. Emerson's own research combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to examining these congregations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reviews the book Making multiracials: State, family, and market in the redrawing of the color line by Kimberly McClain DaCosta (2007). Based on multiple methods, the book paints a multiracial mosaic from in-depth interviews with 62 participants in groups formed for intermarried couples, their families, and multiracial adults, in addition to fieldwork conducted at related events such as mixed-race conferences, college campuses, and public hearings on census classification. The book is divided into seven chapters on various realms including families, communities, and the market, woven together by connected threads on how multiracials have been constructed—socially, culturally, and politically. In the end, Making Multiracials provides a compelling and convincing analysis of not only multiracialism, but the larger racial politics. The strength of the work lies in DaCosta’s multilayered critique of the ways in which multiracialism is constructed. By blending theory, empirical examination, and strong analysis, Making Multiracials offers a nuanced context for understanding the roles that individuals, communities, and policies play in perpetuating and potentially combating racial inequality.

Abstract = {This paper tells the story of 4 sixth-grade students, of mixed race and social class, who worked together in a small group and experimented with colored solutions of different densities. In spite of common interests, they often failed to achieve intersubjective communication about the colored solutions or about the process of planning and making a poster to report their findings. The authors explain this using the concepts of polysemy, privileging, and holding the floor. In particular, Carla (an African American girl) was unable to hold the floor within the group, so her opportunities for science learning were diminished. The four students were not overtly prejudiced in their speech or actions. Yet the expectations they brought with them led them to reconstruct among themselves some of the most troubling inequities of our society as a whole. This story is about important connections. In particular it is about how the actions of children are connected to the histories of their families, and how the privileging of ideas is connected to that of people, and how the practice of science is connected to that of discrimination. Science education reformers may underestimate the difficulty of separating conceptual conflict about ideas from interpersonal conflict about privilege and status.

Abstract = {Derived indices on the Trail Making Test (TMT), a test often used for screening cognitive impairment, were examined in a sample of heroin abusers in drug abuse treatment programs. A mixed race sample of 1,548 Ss was drawn from electronic files of data from the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study, a naturalistic, prospective cohort study that collected data from 1991-1993 in 96 programs in the US. Data were analyzed to determine the effects of demographic variables on derived indices created by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing parts A and B of the TMT in this sample. Results show that the variables of age, ethnicity, and education were strongly statistically significant for the total (A+B) and interaction (A×B/100) derived indices of the TMT. Similarly, the difference score (B-A) was significant for race/ethnicity and education, but the ratio score (B/A) was not significant for any demographic variable.

Abstract = {Examined whether facial averageness and symmetry are attractive in non-Western cultures. Increasing the averageness of individual faces, by warping those faces towards an averaged composite of the same race and sex, increased the attractiveness of both Chinese (Exp 1) and Japanese (Exp 2) faces, for Chinese and Japanese participants, respectively. Decreasing averageness by moving the faces away from an average shape decreased attractiveness. The authors also manipulated the symmetry of Japanese faces by blending each original face with its mirror image to create perfectly symmetric versions. Japanese raters preferred the perfectly symmetric versions to the original faces (Exp 2). These findings show that preferences for facial averageness and symmetry are not restricted to Western cultures, consistent with the view that they are biologically based. Interestingly, it made little difference whether averageness was manipulated by using own-race or other-race averaged composites and there was no preference for own-race averaged composites over other-race or mixed-race composites (Exp 1). We discuss the implications of these results for understanding what makes average faces attractive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the conversational styles employed by students attending a desegregated middle school while discussing race. Students discussed issues related to race in focus groups initially comprised solely of White, Black, or nondominant individuals. Subsequently, subjects (Ss) then convened in mixed-race groups, with conversation styles examined. Results show that Ss employed 2 distinct types of conversational styles. In the 1st type, which may be labeled "bridging talk", Ss used multiple strategies to build unity across differences. In the 2nd type, "conflict talk," Ss discursively created borders and conflict. Findings suggest promises and challenges for each type of discussion. A 3rd form for consideration, "democratic conversation," would invite perspectives while acknowledging the privileging and silencing that accompany them. It is concluded that educators should hold conversations that explicitly address the power dynamics inherent in such conversations and teach the conceptual tools and language to identify these dynamics. Although these conversations across racial lines are sometimes threatening and difficult, they are a critical component of democratic education.

Abstract = {Purpose: To use the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations to examine the predisposing and need characteristics of newly homeless youth that are associated with sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing over time. Methods: A longitudinal cohort of newly homeless youth from Los Angeles County (n = 261; ages 12-20 years) were followed for 24 months. Youth were interviewed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and asked about their background, housing situation, emotional distress (using the Brief-Symptom Inventory), substance use, sexual risk behaviors, and their STD testing rates. We modeled our longitudinal data using logistic random effects models. Results: Characteristics of homeless youth that were associated with STD testing in our multivariate model included time in study (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.6), age at baseline (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4), being African-American (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.3), being from a mixed race/ethnic group (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-5.8), self-identifying as a gay/bisexual male (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.9), self-identifying as a heterosexual female (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.7), using amphetamines (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6), and history of having gotten someone/becoming pregnant (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.9). Youth who lived in an apartment were less likely to have received an STD test than youth who lived in other types of housing (OR .4, 95% CI .2-.9). Sexual risk behaviors such as inconsistent condom use (OR 1.0, 95% CI .6-1.4) and number of sexual partners over past 3 months (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.1) were not predictive of STD testing over time. Conclusions: A need exists for interventions to target young newly homeless youth who engage in high-risk sexual behaviors to increase their STD testing rates and thereby decrease their risk for HIV infection.

Abstract = {Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of drinking, binge drinking (4 or more drinks), and alcohol abuse and dependence and to identify predictors of heavier drinking among women of child-bearing age (18-44 years). Methods: Subjects are part of a national multistage random sample from the 2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Results: Binge drinking, abuse, and dependence are higher in younger (<30 years) pregnant and nonpregnant women. Among pregnant women, binge drinking is highest among Whites; alcohol abuse and dependence rates are relatively low and similar in all racial/ethnic groups. Among nonpregnant women, Whites and mixed race women have the highest rates of binge drinking. Alcohol abuse and dependence are highest among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, followed by Native American/Alaska Native women. Women who are White, younger (21-29 years), single, or cohabiting and with a higher income (>$40,000) are at a higher risk for heavier drinking. Conclusions: Drinking and heavier drinking remain at high levels among women of child-bearing age. Prevention efforts must be comprehensive and should target pregnant women who are drinking and those who could become pregnant and are drinking at high-risk levels.

The process of immigration to and settlement in Australia provides a major focus. Two components of identity that emerged were perceptions about skin colour and Indian heritage. 22 women who participated in this study emigrated from India between 1947 and 1996. Four other women were Australian-born. This qualitative study involved in-depth, semi-structured interviews with the participants who expressed varying levels of identification with Anglo-Indian identity. Realisations about prejudice and discrimination came to the fore during the interview process. This paper picks up on these realisations, investigates the social environments within which they developed and their implications for the identities of Anglo-Indian women.

Except for the Xhosa speaking parents, the majority of parents received the diagnosis in their own language (English or Afrikaans). Most Xhosa speaking parents denied having received an explanation of the diagnosis, or having had an opportunity to ask questions. Only a few Black parents reported being asked as to their understanding of the diagnosis. White parents tended to deny the diagnosis of mental handicap more often than the other groups despite reporting that explanations were given. Most parents felt satisfied with the way the news was given to them and reported good progress in their children, and some of them expected their children to go to a normal school.

Abstract = {In 3 studies, a total of 207 White university summer school students observed slide and type portrayals of interacting small groups that were of mixed sex or mixed race. Hypotheses were that (a) social perceivers encode person information by race and sex; (b) this fact leads to minimizing within-group and exaggerating between-group differences; (c) perceivers stereotype accordingly; (d) within-group attributes, both stereotyped and nonstereotyped, are exaggerated in inverse proportion to the size of the minority subgroup; (e) better discriminations are made within smaller subgroups; (f) imputations of attributes to groups as a whole are also sensitive to the makeup of the group; and (g) all these behaviors are attenuated when the perceiver is a member of the subgroup evaluated. All but the last hypothesis received at least partial support. Results are discussed in terms of categorization processes and suggest that normal cognitive processes explain the process of stereotyping quite well.

The focus of this investigation is on whether, and to what extent, this assimilation can be observed in interviewees' discourse and, moreover, whether the speakers' self-concepts entail their incorporation of "criminal" as an aspect of Black identity. Using social construction, post-colonial and cultural transmission theories to inform this analysis, interviews are inspected to determine whether and to what extent stereotypical views of Black persons are constitutive of the subjects' views of themselves. Findings suggest not only that the persons under study here recognize such stereotypes, but also that they adopt and embrace them. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 6.8 million people, or 2.4% of the national population, identified themselves by two or more races (i.e., biracial or multiracial; Jones & Smith, 2001). Nearly 1.8 million of these individuals reported being Black or African American in combination with another racial or ethnic group. Reported population figures regarding biracial African Americans, however, may be underestimations of the actual size of this population (Brown, 1995; Root, 1996). In particular, the degree to which parents of interracial children address their children's racial group orientation and how people of mixed race heritage identify with either or both racial groups may influence population estimates (Winn & Priest, 1993). In this chapter, we provide some background information pertaining to the historical and current experiences of biracial and multiracial African Americans. We also discuss considerations in the self-identification process for biracial and multiracial African Americans, and we present several prominent identity development models for biracial and multiracial people. In addition, we present issues that mental health counselors might wish to consider when working with biracial and multiracial African Americans.

Abstract = {First and foremost, I am a happily obsessed mother of two--not atypical among older and intellectual types. I am also single by choice, German by birth, part of a mixed-race family through life's interesting turns (my two adopted sons are African American), and, based on my university position, a resident alien (I could go on and on about being a quirky alien, but that's best left for another essay). And I'd like to stress one significant element in this puzzle right from the start: Without the flexibility of an academic schedule, it would have been nearly impossible for me to both continue a rewarding professional and international life (living months on end in Germany) and spend lots of formative baby time (plus now preschool time) with my sons. So I am very grateful to academia. Nonetheless, there are still countless ways to help the typical university environment grow into a more family-friendly one. And this is precisely what inspired me to contribute to this volume, because over my 20 years in academia I have observed far too many incidents of "antifamily" structures and acts. It is not enough to have a "family leave" policy at any given academic institution, although it is a necessary first step. For any reader contemplating a parental leave in the future, I hope to provide a model or two that go beyond the individual and anecdotal. My experiences with the "powers that be" were unique, frustrating, funny, and--in the end--supportive, which I hope will make this an interesting narrative. I mainly hope to show elements any new academic-parent-to-be could use to plan for a smoother transition from a more traditionally male academic role to a more inclusive one.

Abstract = {This empirical study sought to establish the views of a sample of 319 members of the British public concerning the practice of child-specific advertising. It also examined the sample members' relative levels of interest in child-specific advertisements that featured youngsters of specific ages, ethnicities and possessing various forms of disability (physical, psychological or behavioural). Interviews were conducted with individuals of the type targeted by an inner-London local government social services department in venues currently displaying the department's child-specific advertisements. The respondents were generally supportive of child-specific advertising, although older people and individuals of African or African-Caribbean heritage tended to be less enthusiastic about the practice than the rest of the sample. It emerged that behavioural problems were regarded as a more unattractive impairment than either a physical disability or a psychological difficulty. Single people, the less well educated, females, white and mixed-race respondents, and persons with highly altruistic dispositions exhibited significantly different preference structures vis-à-vis alternative combinations of attributes (age, ethnicity and form of impairment) associated with children requiring adoption. The findings should assist managers of local government adoption units to draft child-specific advertisements in manners that maximise the probability of their securing substantial numbers of serious enquiries from particular target audiences.

Abstract = {Presents a clinical case report of approaching homosexuality in a 15-year-old mixed-race boy ("JM") with anxiety and depression. He reported that his anxiety had been growing progressively worse since enrolling in a nearby vocational high school. He endorsed multiple depressive symptoms, including sadness and hopelessness, loss of interest, poor concentration, decreased energy, and increased sleep and appetite, with a 30-pound weight gain over several months. He had experienced occasional passive suicidal ideation, however, he denied any history of self-injurious behavior. The clinicians discuss the complications that may arise in an initial encounter with an adolescent dealing with issues of sexual identity with the reference of JM's case. The exploration of adolescents' sexuality and of positive and negative feelings about their sexual orientation should take place in a therapeutic relationship in which the therapist can remain neutral. Premature closure of the therapist's thinking about an adolescent's sexual orientation may be harmful. It should also be noted how important it is for the therapist to help the gay adolescent find positive role models. While gender identity and sexual orientation are sensitive issues, especially for an adolescent, clinicians must inquire about them in the same caring, nonjudgmental manner as any other aspect of the patient's life.

Abstract = {In this historical period of globalization, new constructions of identity as well as new clinical questions arise. They concern cultural mixing (of birth), identity mixing (due to acculturation and to social, intellectual or spiritual changes). They also concern the different figures of neoparentality (family reconstructions after divorces and separations, homo-parentality, single parentality), as well as adoptions, medically attended procreations, and transidentities (transsexuals, transgenders). The author shows why and how the clinic of crossbreedings constitutes a new paradigm that helps to understand other new constructions of identities. In such cases, psychotherapy consists in accompanying the vicissitudes of a metamorphosis of identity. Finally, crossbreedings play also an interesting political role: they are interlinkers between heterogeneous worlds. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Quality of sexually transmitted disease (STD) primary care in South Africa varies widely but reasons for this are poorly understood. We investigated 37 randomly sampled clinics providing STD care, with simulated patients, and staff interviews and record review. Census data provided local socioeconomic indicators. Multiple regression identified independent predictors of quality. Of 271 simulated patient visits, 79% were correctly treated and 39% were correctly managed. Women received worse care, and care tended to be poorer in mainly African and mainly coloured (mixed race) areas. African and Indian nurses were more likely to provide correct treatment. Previous STD training was marginally associated with correct treatment. Quality assessments using simulated patients were not generally associated with assessments using staff interviews and record review. There were frequent missed opportunities for STD prevention and treatment, and evidence of racial but not socioeconomic inequalities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This is a lively and sensitive account of a session with a latency-aged boy beginning to engage in a dialogue with his therapist. As such it illustrates what must have been an internal change, a change that allowed Ben to feel safe enough to have moments of talking to the therapist as a nine-year-old boy as opposed to as a superhero. It is helpful to know at the outset that a first sibling is soon due, and to have a sense of the material preceding the session given. The introduction conveys a clear sense of Ben as a boy relying on omnipotent defences to protect him from feeling frightened, helpless, powerless, and perhaps also terrifyingly small in the face of others experienced as mercilessly powerful. The session begins in the waiting room. Ben is hiding. Understandably, the therapist does not want to engage in play in the waiting room, but Ben is disappointed to be found. Soon Ben puts the therapist on the spot in regard to the date of his birthday. At this point in the session, however, Ben withdraws when the therapist explicitly takes up his anxiety about the new baby messing up his birthday. We also learn why we were given the detail that Ben is a boy of mixed race. The baby must have a different father from Ben, as the new sibling will be white.

Abstract = {This session occurs in the fifth term of twice-weekly psychotherapy with a nine-year-old mixed-race boy. In the weeks before this session, the therapy time has been filled with much manic activity. Ben has been leaping around the room with great athletic agility from chair to table to sofa while at the same time recounting to me in much detail and with a great deal of animation the exploits of his favourite characters from films such as Spiderman, Dragonball-Z and the James Bond films. Attempts by me to help him feel less anxious and to think about what is behind all this activity have usually been met with verbal abuse or an angry leaving of the room. He has been particularly hostile to any links I have tried to make between his worries and the impending arrival of a first sibling. However, we have been able to establish together that watching television and playing computer games are his 'addiction' (his words), and that he feels that he needs to act like a warrior and be on his mettle most of the time as life can be so frightening.

Abstract = {In this paper, we present evidence that supports the hypothesis that to be socially successful, people must have good self-regulation. Fifteen lines of research, including resistance to influence attempts, self-presentation, regulatory focus and interpersonal inspiration, accommodative responses, resisting the temptation of attractive alternates, self-serving biases in close relationships, conforming to group pressures, mixed race interactions, and stereotyping outgroup members, confirm the hypothesis. This review concludes that social functioning hinges on a host of self-control strategies: when people regulate their emotions, control the contents of their thoughts, override initial impulses, and redirect their behavior, they improve their chances at social inclusion. When people fail at self-regulation, they are likely to be ousted from groups and relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Abstract = {The Trail Making Test (TMT) is often used for screening cognitive impairments in substance abusers. A possible limitation of the TMT in clinical settings is that substance abusers may malinger and give poor effort. In this study, previously validated cutting scores for malingering were applied to a sample of 7,689 substance abusers (aged 18-44+ yrs) in drug abuse treatment programs. A mixed race sample was drawn from electronic files of data from the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study. Data were analyzed to determine the number of substance abusers that fell beyond the preset malingering cutting scores on the TMT. Results indicate that the TMT variables of seconds to complete Part A and Part B, and the ratio score of Part B divided by Part A (B/A), ranged from no subjects beyond the preset cutting score for Part B to 2.28% for Part A to 9.74% for the ratio score. Most substance abusers fell within preset cutting score ranges, a finding that suggests that their scores are valid. Another interpretation of the data, however, is that the cutoff scores were not particularly sensitive to biased responding. Further research is indicated.

Abstract = {While studies of racial residential preferences generally converge on the pattern that blacks prefer neighborhoods with a substantial proportion of African Americans, but whites are uncomfortable with no more than 20% black, the forces underlying these preferences receive comparatively less empirical attention. This paper uses perceptions of community undesirability as a measure of racial residential preferences to address this question. Data come from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, which asked large samples of whites and African Americans in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles to rate the desirability of 5-7 local communities. In addition to the closed-ended ratings, this paper draws on a systematic analysis of open-ended survey data asking respondents to explain why they find communities undesirable. Overall, blacks rate most communities as more desirable than whites, and African Americans find desirable many of the communities in which they are the numerical minority. Whites rate mixed race communities as undesirable, in part because of a desire to avoid black neighbors, but also because of what may be an over-inflated perception of crime in those communities. Analyses of African American community ratings highlight the importance of racial climate in shaping perceptions of communities and argue against the assertion that racial composition alone is the key factor in black preferences.

Abstract = {Using a life course perspective, this paper traces cigarette use over ages 13-17 yrs among a mixed-race sample of economically disadvantaged urban students. Compared to African American teens, cigarette use by white teens was much more prevalent. Still, experimentation with cigarettes (aged 13-14 yrs) was a powerful predictor of cigarette use at ages 15 and 17 for youth of both races, with those who were least engaged in school more likely to experiment at early ages. Employment during the school year predicted more use of cigarettes mainly by white males, with cigarette use by white females not related to employment. The number of African Americans in this sample who used cigarettes was so few that to analyze cigarette use in relation to employment is not possible. White male students were more disengaged from school, and more likely to be performing adult-type work than other students. This paper suggests they use cigarettes as a means to signal their acceleration of the adult transition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study investigated possible associations between ethnic background of referred children and non-attendance, referrer type, problem type, age and gender. The sample consisted of 769 children (aged 15 yrs or under) offered outpatient appointments. Ethnic background influenced referrer type. Over-referrals against expectations were: White children more by GPs than expected, Black and South Asian children by specialist doctors, Black children by education services and Mixed Race children by social services. There was neither a significant difference in ethnic background between attendees and non-attendees nor were gender, age or problem types related to ethnic group. Clinicians should be aware that referral routes may appropriately, or inappropriately, be different for different ethnic groups. Differences found may be due to genuine variations in morbidity, thus leading to presentation to different referrers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Children from divorced homes had more positive sibling relationships than children from intact homes. Mixed-race samples of children had more negative interpersonal relationships than white samples of children. Younger children from divorced homes experienced a lower quality of mother–child relationship than older children. The quality of relationships are lower for studies conducted more recently when compared with those conducted in earlier decades. Larger samples and studies utilizing attitude measures yielded stronger evidence for a lower quality of interpersonal relationship. Effect sizes were stronger for clinical samples than in studies based on convenience or random samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) across the US. Face-to-face interviews were conducted among 2612 randomly selected Ss (aged 15-25) from 13 cities in venues identified with large samples of ethnic minority YMSM. The 13 sites were divided into 4 ethnic strata, within which only YMSM of 1 of the following ethnic backgrounds were recruited: African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and mixed ethnicity. Results show that 22% of Ss reported that their last sexual contact with their main sexual partner, someone other than a main sexual partner, or both involved unprotected anal intercourse. Ss from Asian/Pacific Islander sites, mixed sites, and Hispanic sites were more likely than Ss from African American sites to report unprotected anal intercourse. Within the mixed sites, Hispanic Ss, followed by Asian/Pacific Islander and White Ss, were more likely than African American Ss to report unprotected anal intercourse. It is concluded that interventions are needed that are responsive to the racial/ethnic differences in HIV risk behaviors of YMSM throughout urban American cities.

Abstract = {Examines the prevalence of gambling and measures the relationships between gambling behavior and a number of demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral variables among 78,582 male and female Minnesota public school 9th and 12th graders. Ss completed the 1998 Minnesota Student Survey, a 121-item, questionnaire that inquires about multiple health-related content domains, including gambling behavior. The majority of students had gambled at least once during the past year, however, most students did not report gambling frequently, nor did they report problems associated with their gambling. Boys reported gambling more often than girls, and older students gambled more often than younger students. A larger percentage of Mexican/Latin American, African American, American Indian, and mixed race students gambled at weekly and daily rates than Asian American and Caucasian students. Variables associated with gambling frequency included antisocial behavior, gender (being a male), alcohol and tobacco use, age, feeling bad about the amount of money they bet, a desire to stop gambling, and increased sexual activity. Gambling appears to be related to other risk-taking behaviors and may be a part of the adolescent experimentation with adult behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

She volunteered to take a battery of tests for the author and took the Draw-A-Person Questionnaire (S. A.

Abstract = {This book explores a model of counseling and psychotherapy based on the multicultural perspective that evolved from the author's work with "the different." It introduces 5 new case studies to supplement the 5 presented in the earlier edition and includes a chapter on family therapy that adds insights into counseling and/or therapy for mixed-race couples. A new chapter has also been added on how the multicultural model can be useful in meeting guidelines introduced through managed care.  The principal objectives of the model are to help people who feel different and alienated accept and understand their uniqueness. The model also seeks to enhance cultural values and to develop flexibility in cognitive styles. Although its primary focus is on ethnic/racial minorities, the model is appropriate for members of any group that differs from the societal ideal.  The ultimate goal of this model is the development of a multicultural orientation to life. The techniques and strategies reflect an eclecticism, ranging from the intensive study of the client's life history and the use of insight, to the employment of cognitive behavioral as well as humanistic and cross-cultural approaches. Multicultural therapy, however, is unique in its theoretical concepts and goals for change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (preface)},

Abstract = {The psychometric properties of a multidimensional measure of social support, A. Vaux's Social Support Behaviors Scale (SS-B), were evaluated. The SS-B is represented by subscales describing 5 central categories of supportive behaviors (Emotional, Socializing, Practical, Financial, and Advice/Guidance), assessed for both friends and family. The SS-B was administered to a low SES, mixed-race (19% Anglo, 37% African American, and 40% Hispanic) sample of 105 adolescents who were attending pregnancy prevention programs. A trend toward high scores, low variance, and few differences between pregnant/parenting and nonpregnant/parenting teens were found on subscale scores. Factor analyses on separate subscales showed loadings more consistently for "family" than "friends." Overall results of psychometric analysis indicate that the scale needs further work to more accurately assess the salient behavioral dimensions of social support for samples from varying racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.

Abstract = {This study provides a demographic portrait of multiracial households, using children as the units of analysis. The authors conceptualize three dimensions for understanding multiracialness: (1) the racial composition of a household overall, (2) where in the household a racial difference exists relative to the household head, and (3) where in the household a racial difference exists relative to each child. Using microdata from the 1980 U.S. census, the authors explore the first two of these dimensions and test two propositions about the links between racial diversity and other nonracial attributes of children's household environments. The finding is made, among other things, that the largest proportion of children live in Asian-white households, and that about 60% live in households headed by mixed-race couples. Support for the notion that attributes of multiracial households fall between those of their same-race counterparts was mixed. Nonetheless, there appears to be a link between location of diversity and some nonracial characteristics of the household. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Initial group encounters were intellectual and somewhat educational as Ss shared their life experiences. Armoring was used by Black and other Ss of color to promote self-caring during direct encounters with racist experiences. Co-leaders of the group were a Black clinician (the author) paired with a graduate student who had or was experiencing a mixed race relationship. Most Ss moved to the host environment of the spouse upon marriage. Group activity focused on establishing a definite identity for children and reinforcing it with models to support pridefulness. Group concerns about childrearing practices were racial: White Ss were criticized for being too permissive with children, and Black Ss were criticized by spouses for being too strict and by their families for being too permissive. Ss needed support and clarification around the question of what is developmental and what is cultural. Ss were trained to take leadership roles and continued meeting in their homes.

Abstract = {Examined familial and contextual factors that influenced the development of racial self-perceptions among 30 Black or mixed-race children and adolescents (aged 10–21 yrs) who had been adopted by White parents. Questionnaires and interviews with both children and parents revealed 3 ways that families dealt with racial identity issues. 18 of the families rarely discussed racial issues or associated with Blacks, and the children perceived themselves as different from other Blacks in terms of attitudes and culture. These children also held strong feelings of "differentness" and negative attitudes toward other Blacks. A 2nd group of 6 families acknowledged the child's racial identity and the need to provide Black role models for the child. These families lived in integrated neighborhoods, and the children expressed an interest in contact with other Blacks and often discussed racial identity issues with parents and peers. A 3rd group, in which parents generally had adopted several Black children, were characterized as interracial, and children were taught to emphasize their Black heritage. These families also provided a psychological support network for the adopted children. Findings suggest that transracial adoptions require special efforts on the part of parents and children and postplacement work on the part of the adoption agency.

Although great similarities were found between the factor structures of the 4 populations, the factor structures were not invariant. Factorial invariance was shown to exist for the 2 high socioeconomic status (SES) groups and for the 2 low SES groups. A marked similarity between the nonverbal reasoning factors was also found for all populations. (34 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the preference of Asian children to use their parental language over English in various contexts, such as when counting, by means of a questionnaire completed by a group of 40 bilingual Asian children that was compared with an age-matched mixed race monolingual group of 24 children (aged 7 and 8 yrs for both groups). SES was low. Group allocation was based on a specially devised Language Preference Questionnaire (LPQ) examining different contexts of language use (e.g., during numerical analysis). Standardized tests of non-verbal intelligence, vocabulary, basic reading, reading comprehension and the LPQ were given. Results indicate that controlling for non-verbal intelligence, there was a marked difference in receptive oral vocabulary and a weaker difference in reading ability between the 2 groups. The LPQ show that bilingual children who reported thinking in their parental language had poorer English vocabulary development than bilingual children who preferred to think in English. These findings are discussed in terms of either an effect of frequency of exposure to language or in terms of differences in phonological development between the 2 groups.

The scores of the racial groups and the total population in general were superior in 1938 to what they were in 1924, but the rank order of the racial groups changed only slightly over the interval; the high-scoring groups made more improvement than the low-scoring groups. More improvement was made in the non-verbal test than in the English tests. 1924 group non-verbal scores predicted 1938 group printed English comprehension scores better than 1938 group non-verbal scores. No downward trend in non-verbal scores with increasing age was shown for low as compared with high scoring groups. There was a high correspondence between school achievement rank and rank order in test scores.

Racial differences were noted on 4 of the 13 raw Wiggins scale scores, with scores for African-American patients more elevated on Poor Health, Feminine Interests, Phobias, and Psychoticism. A backward multiple-regression procedure was used to predict raw Wiggins scale scores from parent descriptions as measured by the Personality Inventory for Children clinical scales. Predictors supported the validity of the Organic Symptoms, Social Maladjustment, Family Problems, Authority Conflict, and Hypomania scales, and to some extent, Poor Morale, Depression, Poor Health, and Phobias. Predictors differed across racial groups for 9 of the scales, with particular discrepancies in predictive meaning for Poor Health, Hypomania, Family Problems, and Authority Conflict.

These educational centers included special schools for physically disabled children with normal or borderline IQs, training centers for children with IQ 30–50, and special care centers for profoundly retarded children. The results show that 75% of Black, 40% of mixed race, and 10% of White children had no regular contact with a doctor through their special educational centers. Staff at the centers identified this as a major encumbrance; many times their advice was not followed or no response was received from the referral center.

The author draws on fieldwork conducted in the Midlands area and a suburban town in the south east of England and traces the ways in which project participants mobilised their biographies and ancestries to express feelings of empathy and relatedness across black, white and Asian identities. The author discovered the same people articulated a strong sense of classed distinction between themselves and others who were thought to lack respectability, social ambition and mobility. These observations have led me to reflect upon the theoretical contrasts between what Stuart Hall has famously called ‘new ethnicities’ and what the author calls ‘old classities’.

Abstract = {Discusses the experiences of Black children in the care of Social Services and away from home. The issues explored are particularly pertinent for these children in making sense of their own identities, lives and emotional attachments. The material referred to is drawn from work carried out within the Southwark Social Services/Guy's Hospital Child Psychology's Service for Black Children Looked After program. The author concentrates on the concept of self- and ethnic identity as it affects Black children and children of mixed parentage. W. E. Cross's (1991) model of identity development is referred to and is found to be helpful in understanding self-rejection and conflict not as indicative of long-term crisis, but as part of a process, a quest for self and integration.

Abstract = {Originally published in Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books, 1996, Vol 41(1), 19-20. Is there a "color line" in psychotherapy? Certainly there are stereotypes developed and preserved by psychological theorists and therapists that serve as expressions of established expectations and assumptions. These have, it is argued in this book (see record [rid]1994-98466-000[/rid]), prevented adequate treatment and service delivery to women who do not fit their image of a model client. The color line, a term drawn from recent U.S. history, was an actual demarcation drawn down hallways and waiting rooms to keep "colored people" (as Blacks and others were designated) separate from Whites as part of enforced segregation. This compendium of conceptual analyses, case examples, and suggestions for therapy invites those who would address the therapeutic needs of women to consider change. The goal of this book, which is well conceived and carefully organized, is to alert therapists to the changing realities of the U.S. demographics and prepare them to deliver services to an increasingly diverse population. This book makes a respectable effort at covering the topics of importance for women of the major ethnic groups now in the United States. As it stands, they include chapters on at least six ethnic groups (African Americans, American Indians, Asians, Latinas, women from the Caribbean, and women from India) and five special populations (professionals, lesbians, women of mixed race, refugees, and women who are battered). If there is any major omission, it is the surprising lack of any detailed discussion of the therapist-client relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Previous research has indicated that preschool-aged children are aware of racial differences, but this awareness does not affect their interaction in mixed-race groups. The present study extended this work by comparing 2- and 4-person homogeneous and racially mixed groups of 31/2-5 yr. old children. Results indicate that the frequencies of initiations and negative responses were lower in 4-person racially mixed groups than in 4-person homogeneous groups. Also, the ratio of responses in general to initiations was lower in mixed groups than in homogeneous groups. Thus, racial awareness was found to inhibit social behavior.

Abstract = {This study looked for long-term effects of Cesarean birth, using a stratified mixed-race random sample of Baltimore school children who began first grade in 1982. There were no effects on children's California Achievement Test scores in the verbal or math domains at the start of Grade 1. There were also no effects on a personal maturity/temperament measure or on special problem status in Grade 1. Parents of Cesarean-born children, nevertheless, believed that their children had more ability to do schoolwork than did parents of other children, and the Cesarean-born children themselves expected higher marks in reading and math than did other children. These findings dove-tail with the limited prior research on short-term or long-term sociopsychological effects of Cesarean birth on children or on parents.

Abstract = {Examined the relationships between ethnicity, conceptions of mental illness, and attitudes associated with seeking psychological help in 321 White and 192 Black schoolteachers (aged 20+ yrs). Ss completed a conception of mental illness questionnaire, an attitude scale, vignettes that elicited opinions on certain counseling issues, and a demographic datasheet. Results indicate significant differences between Blacks and Whites in their conceptions of mental illness; Blacks' responses were more stereotypic, and Whites' were closer to those of mental health professionals. Both Blacks and Whites had similar positive attitudes toward seeking psychological help; however, significantly more Whites had actually been in therapy. Blacks showed more positive attitudes toward mixed-race dyads in counseling but showed more negative attitudes concerning the efficacy of psychological treatment for certain problems. Conception of mental illness was significantly related to attitudes associated with seeking psychological help. Findings support the assertions of C. Tucker (1979) that the different conceptualization of mental illness among Blacks may be a factor in their underutilization of mental health services.

Abstract = {A study of 218 cases shows the following: (1) The disease is not frequent in the Michigan state hospitals. (2) It appears to be one of the few strictly inheritable diseases. (3) The age of onset varies widely. (4) There seems to be no reliable indication in early life of the later development of the disease. (5) Behavior difficulties appeared in two-thirds of the choreics. (6) With regard to mental disease, the greater number of the hospitalized cases were classified with the psychosis undifferentiated. (7) The average length of life after the development of the disease was found to be 16.1 years. (8) Exhaustion was the most frequent cause of death. (9) Seventeen cases of Sydenham's chorea were found to have occurred in otherwise non-choreic relatives; Sydenham's chorea also occurred in three individuals who afterward developed Huntington's chorea. (10) Other neuropathic conditions found in the families of choreics appear to be incidental. (11) The families were largely of mixed race and rural environment predominated. (12) Only 31 per cent of the choreics became public charges. (13) Potential choreics evidently do not abstain from marriage. Prevention will best be gained through education of the public to the dangers of transmission, in the hope that the affected stock will avoid marriage, or employ voluntary sterilization.

The author has been involved in the treatment of 9 black female South Africans with eating disorders and notes the absence of any unique features designating the sufferers as black. These observations suggest that, within the urban setting, there is a homogenization of eating-related psychopathology across racial groups. In a sample of 213 adolescent female South African private school students, the author found that 20.7% of white Ss and 37.5% of black Ss were classified as having abnormal eating attitudes based on their responses to the Eating Attitudes Test. 18.6% of black and white adolescent government school students (N = 1,353) also showed abnormal eating attitudes. The author suggests that it is clear that, within the broader South African community, eating attitudes exist that place a significant proportion of adolescents and young adults of all racial groups at risk for the development of eating disorders.
