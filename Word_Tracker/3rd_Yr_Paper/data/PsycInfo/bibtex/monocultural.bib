Abstract = {The synchronized terror attacks on July 22, 2011 was the worst politically motivated assault in post-WW2 Norway. To the perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik, 22/7 was a "marketing operation," designed to draw attention to his compendium, 2083: A European Declaration of Independence. While Breivik acted alone, his political philosophy is far from unique. Through a detailed analysis of the compendium's content, identifying the original authors whose texts Breivik used but did not always acknowledge, this essay discusses the political traditions that informed the assailant's worldview: Islamophobia (anti-Muslim racism), cultural conservative nationalism, antifeminism, and selected elements of White Power thought, far Right evangelical theology, and the Knights Templar tradition, all permeated by romantic male warrior ideals. The stunning violence of July 22 was a hyper-masculine performative act aimed at producing a heroic avant-garde of nationalist warriors who will rise to purge Europe from the corrupting influence of its internal enemies and defeat its external enemies. Through the cleansing fire of the civil war, he believes that a reborn Europe will arise to reclaim its ordained position of glory as the world's leading civilization. In the final analysis, Breivik's political philosophy may thus be recognized as a 21st-century articulation of the fascist legacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The study explored the content and hierarchical structure of representations of New Zealand national character and identity. We argue that at the most abstract level perceived elements of New Zealand national character reflect a tension between two different domains. The first reflects an Anglicized monocultural representation of what it means to be a “true New Zealander” derived primarily from dominant majority (NZ European or Pākehā) groups’ symbols and values. The second reflects an inclusive recognition, albeit tokenized, of symbolic aspects of Māori culture and pluralistic intergroup relations. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified five distinct sub-factors of national character nested within these two broader exclusive (Anglicized monocultural) and inclusive (pluralist) factors (or overall representations). Monocultural aspects of national character included representations of rugby/sporting culture, citizenship and ancestry, and to a lesser extent patriotic values. Pluralistic aspects of national character, in contrast, included representations of cultural/bicultural awareness and liberal democratic values, but also patriotism. The socio-cultural geneses of this hierarchically-organized representational structure are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to explore the impact of independent and interdependent self-construals on relations between work and family demands (workload and family conflict) and work/family conflict (WFC and FWC). Three hundred and ten Taiwanese employees were surveyed at two times (6 weeks apart) using structured questionnaires. For Taiwanese employees, workload was positively related to WFC (r = .39), whereas family conflict was positively related to FWC (r = .24). Furthermore, independent self-construal exacerbated the positive relation between workload and WFC (the interaction effect accounted for an additional 1.7% of variance in WFC), but buffered the positive relation between family conflict and FWC (the interaction effect accounted for an additional 2.6% of variance in FWC). However, interdependent self-construal did not have a moderating effect on either the workload−WFC or family conflict−FWC relation. It is recommended that culture as construed at the individual level needs to be studied in order to understand its intricate effects on individuals' perceptions of work and family demands and conflict.

Abstract = {Comprehensive comparison and conceptual analysis of cross-cultural, cultural, and indigenous psychologies in terms of their aims and theoretical and methodological perspectives lead to the conclusion that the first 2 are special cases of the third. Two basic types of indigenous psychology are distinguished on the basis of conceptual analysis: monocultural indigenous psychologies (including monocultural cultural psychologies) and cross-cultural indigenous psychologies (including both cross-cultural psychology and cross-cultural cultural psychology). Corresponding to these 2 types of indigenous psychology are 2 basic ways to conduct indigenous research, namely, the monocultural indigenous approach and the cross-cultural indigenous approach. Both approaches require achievement of the condition of indigenous compatibility, which stresses the sufficient congruity of the researcher's theory, methods, and results with the studied psychological or behavioral phenomenon and/or sociocultural context. Finally, several ways to integrate research findings obtained by the monocultural and cross-cultural indigenous approaches are delineated and discussed with respect to their function in creating and indigenously derived global psychology.

Abstract = {In recent times reports into incidents of racist violence in Britain identified a prevailing institutionalized racism and social segregation (Cantle, 2002; MacPherson, 1999). In this article I present an analysis of authoritative educational discourse in the form of school inspection reports, focusing on a single issue: the cultural practice of minority ethnic families visiting their heritage country. Using critical discourse analysis, I suggest that the discourse of the inspection reports racializes the cultural practices of the Asian minority, defining them as the alien and foreign. In this discourse an uncontested, common-sense discourse emerges, which blames minority families for the presupposed harm done to their children's education by visits to the heritage country. I conclude that such cultural practices become an emblem of difference, whereas the dominant ideology in official discourse is one of homogenization. This discourse implies that for minority ethnic families to be part of the imagined community of successful learners in Britain, this cultural practice will have to stop.

Abstract = {Introduces this special section of American Psychologist. Behind this collection of articles lies a shift in national attention comparable to that inspired by the 1957 appearance of Sputnik, an event that triggered an unprecedented commitment of U.S. national resources to the fields of engineering and foreign language and area studies. Repeated shocks to America's position in the world--as we Americans understand it--over the past five years have raised renewed interest in the unpredictable world beyond our borders. Bills to provide greatly increased funds for language training have passed one or both houses of Congress, the Fulbright programs held their own in the 1981 budget offensive, and the American Psychological Association (APA) was asked to join a multidisciplinary effort to call attention to the need of our students, particularly those whose field of study is human behavior, to learn more about the world. The five articles that follow were commissioned by APA's Board of Directors as part of a "Project on International Education in the Undergraduate Disciplines" supported by the National Council on Foreign Language and International Studies (NCFLIS) through a grant from the U.S. Department of Education. A major theme emerges clearly from the articles that appear in this special section. There appears to be general agreement among the authors that U.S. psychology suffers from insularity, perhaps born of the very great size of the "domestic market" in psychology in this country, For the sake of the science, however, and to increase its scope of application, the authors urge that U.S. psychologists reach out toward a more truly international science, one fully sensitive to the powerful, multiform variable of culture.

Abstract = {This study provides new evidence concerning task specificity in creativity—examining through a cross‐cultural perspective the extent to which performance in graphic versus verbal creativity tasks (domain specificity) and in divergent versus convergent creativity tasks (process specificity) are correlated. The relations between different creativity tasks in monocultural and multicultural samples of Chinese and French children were compared. Electronic versions of the Wallach and Kogan Creativity Test (WKCT, Wallach & Kogan, 1965; Lau & Cheung, 2010) and the Evaluation of Potential Creativity (EPoC; Lubart, Besançon, & Barbot, 2011; Barbot, Besançon, & Lubart, 2011) were used. Both measures showed satisfactory psychometric properties and cross‐cultural structural validity. The results showed that culture has an impact on the structure of creative ability: It appeared that correlation patterns were different across Chinese and French groups and across monocultural and multicultural groups. Such results show that it is crucial to take task specificity into account when investigating the effect of culture on creativity. Indeed, our study implies that cultural differences that are found using one specific creativity task might not be automatically generalizable to all sorts of creativity tasks. Limitations are discussed and perspectives for future research on culture and task specificity in creativity are proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The current study examined the structural composition of the communication networks of Korean immigrants’ ethnic church community, which became the main sources of their social capital. The study measured the effect of their network characteristics (i.e., size, diversity, and centrality) on individuals’ monocultural and intercultural orientations. A total of seven hypotheses, drawn from Smith's (1999) theoretical propositions on intercultural communication networks, were tested. An organizational member survey (N =178) of a Korean immigrant church was used to construct the whole network of the organization. Additionally, the relationships between major constructs (i.e., social capital and intercultural development) were analyzed with hierarchical regression modeling. Results suggested that network diversity had a positive influence on intercultural orientation while network centrality had a positive influence on monocultural orientation among Korean immigrant church members. Network size was positively associated with network diversity after controlling for the effect of English proficiency. Among the three groups of Korean immigrant occupations (i.e., professional, unskilled labor, unemployed), the professional group and the unskilled group showed a significant difference in their intercultural orientation. The research findings suggest that regardless of an individual immigrant's will, over-embeddedness in intra-cultural communication networks can increase one's ethonocentric cultural attitudes and beliefs.

However, young adolescents from binational families performed better on creativity tests (fluency, flexibility, and originality) than those from monocultural families. In addition, when variables of family background and young adolescents’ personalities were controlled for, the effect of binational families on creativity remained.

Abstract = {The influences of globalization have permeated various aspects of life in contemporary society, from technical innovations, economic development, and lifestyles, to communication patterns. The present research proposed a construct termed global orientation to denote individual differences in the psychological processes of acculturating to the globalizing world. It encompasses multicultural acquisition as a proactive response and ethnic protection as a defensive response to globalization. Ten studies examined the applicability of global orientations among majority and minority groups, including immigrants and sojourners, in multicultural and relatively monocultural contexts, and across Eastern and Western cultures. Multicultural acquisition is positively correlated with both independent and interdependent self-construals, bilingual proficiency and usage, and dual cultural identifications. Multicultural acquisition is promotion-focused, while ethnic protection is prevention-focused and related to acculturative stress. Global orientations affect individuating and modest behavior over and above multicultural ideology, predict overlap with outgroups over and above political orientation, and predict psychological adaptation, sociocultural competence, tolerance, and attitudes toward ethnocultural groups over and above acculturation expectations/strategies. Global orientations also predict English and Chinese oral presentation performance in multilevel analyses and the frequency and pleasantness of intercultural contact in cross-lagged panel models. We discuss how the psychological study of global orientations contributes to theory and research on acculturation, cultural identity, and intergroup relations.

Abstract = {Indigenous peoples have poorer health outcomes than their non-indigenous counterparts and this applies to cancer outcomes for Māori in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Differential access to and quality of healthcare contributes to poorer survival rates for Māori. This research provides insight into some of the mechanisms that hinder and facilitate care access. Thirty four people who had undergone cancer treatment (19 Māori and 15 non-Māori) were interviewed by two Māori researchers. The analysis of the interview transcripts was informed by membership categorization analysis. This form of analysis attends to the categories that are used and the activities and characteristics associated with those categories. From this analysis it is argued that the classical patient role, or sick role, inadequately captures the kind of role that some Māori take in relation to their healthcare. Māori can also have culturally specific family (whānau) influences and a greater draw towards alternative approaches to healthcare. Dissonant roles contribute to a different experience for Māori. A better understanding of the categories and roles that are relevant to those who have cancer provides opportunities to attenuate the monocultural impacts of healthcare.

Abstract = {This article examines how essentializing ideologies of language and identity in Toronto's Portuguese ethnic market, constructed as monolingual and monocultural within the larger mainstream market of English-speaking Canada, provide the background for humorous sociolinguistic performances that playfully acknowledge, reproduce, and challenge ethnolinguistic stratification. After more than sixty years, the dominant spaces of the local Portuguese market continue to exclude most Portuguese-Canadian youth by rarely legitimizing the use of English, bilingual code-switching, or ‘broken’ or ‘Azorean’ Portuguese. By choosing YouTube as a space in which to engage audiences in ideologies of language and identity through performances of sociolinguistic caricatures, three young Portuguese-Canadian amateur comedians negotiate sociolinguistic boundaries with an ambivalent agency. The mocking performances are legitimized by the performers' in-group status and reveal, among other things, how a stigmatized variety of Azorean Portuguese and certain ethnolinguistic stereotypes can be reap-propriated and reinforced relative to sociolinguistic hierarchies.

Abstract = {This article explores how Islamic values influence management and business practice in Morocco with a view to a new understanding of how one of the global, socio-political tides of the early twenty-first century is now beginning to make itself felt commercially. An interpretivist approach, coupled with access to a rich and hitherto inaccessible mix of diverse and highly placed participants, allows the authors to augment extant research with a vivid rendering of the lived reality of Islamic management practice. And in consequence, sweeping monocultural generalisations about national character and practice can be refined into a nuanced and layered analysis of actual management behaviour. In order to understand how Islamic values influence management practice the findings unravel what has hitherto been presented in the extant literature as a Gordian Knot of complex influences. By putting the voices of participants ‘centre-stage’ the Gordian Knot is replaced by the metaphor of the Arabesque, a Moorish artform typically comprising motifs of flowing branches, leaves and scroll work all interlaced and entwined. Just as these typical motifs are ever-present in the form of the Arabesque yet take on a unique pattern in each individual depiction, so it is with the characteristics which influence management practice in Morocco. The principal motifs elicited from participants include: ‘living’ Islam (including the interaction of Islam and personal beliefs, alongside the influence of kinship); Islam versus Moroccan Islam (the national culture's ingestion of a religion); national characteristics of family and patriarchy (including the support that employees expect from their managers); socio-economic factors, in particular education and gender (life experiences including education and the home); and foreign influences (the impact of Western colonialism). This research identifies that these principal motifs are ever-present in their influence on management practice, yet in each individual's case the pattern of such influence bears the unique imprint of the individual manager's own religiosity and character.

Abstract = {Understanding the value of monocultural acculturation orientation to the host culture (assimilation) and bicultural acculturation orientation (integration) for language learning is critical in guiding educational policy and practices for immigrant students. This study aimed to enhance our understanding on the relationship between acculturation orientation and second language (L2) learning. It generated two conceptual models to describe how cultural identification affects language learning as hypothesized in different theories on identity and L2 learning and tested these two hypothesized models in the immigration context of Hong Kong. A survey was conducted among a group of senior high school South Asian minority students on their learning of the language of the host culture, Chinese, to provide the basis for comparison. It was found that the students mainly adopted the bicultural/integration orientation and that bicultural orientation was the optimal acculturation orientation for learning Chinese. Bicultural orientation influenced the participants' Chinese language learning outcome through impacting psychosocial well-being and engagement with the target language and community. The findings suggest that we need to take both linguistic and psychosocial adjustment factors into consideration when conceptualizing the role of identity in L2 learning. Furthermore, this study cautions us against a context-independent stance toward the utility of assimilation for language learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The present study tests the hypothesis that involvement with a new culture instigates changes in personality of immigrants that result in (a) better fit with the norms of the culture of destination and (b) reduced fit with the norms of the culture of origin. Participants were 40 Japanese first-generation immigrants to the United States, 57 Japanese monoculturals, and 60 U.S. monoculturals. All participants completed the Jackson Personality Inventory as a measure of the Big Five; immigrants completed the Japanese American Acculturation Scale. Immigrants’ fits with the cultures of destination and origin were calculated by correlating Japanese American mothers’ patterns of ratings on the Big Five with the average patterns of ratings of European Americans and Japanese on the same personality dimensions. Japanese Americans became more “American” and less “Japanese” in their personality as they reported higher participation in the U.S. culture. The results support the view that personality can be subject to cultural influence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how bicultural consumers differ from monocultural consumers in terms of personality traits and identity negotiation. Design/methodology/approach - Through a multidisciplinary literature review, some anecdotally and qualitatively supported differences between biculturals and monoculturals are reviewed and formulated as hypotheses, and a survey is used to collect quantitative data from a mixed random-purposeful sample. Findings - Relative to monoculturals, biculturals exhibit greater concern about their acceptability within pertinent reference groups and society at large; have comparable levels of need for uniqueness and art enthusiasm; and consume more artwork as a means and in the process of their routine negotiation of (ethnic) identity. Ethnicity, need for social acceptability, need for group identification, and art enthusiasm are predictors of artwork consumption. Ethnicity, in particular, is a key precursor of artwork consumption. Research limitations/implications - As a starting-point for understanding the bicultural consumer, the study is subject to exploratory research limitations. Originality/value - As partial manifestations of globalization, businesses are challenged today in several ways by the rise and proliferation of the bicultural neotribe. Businesses do not have to fall victim to these challenges; they can turn them around and strategically leverage them as marketplace opportunities. The study provides some early insights that can help businesses to leverage such opportunities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: The paper's aim is to explore how bicultural consumers differ from monocultural consumers, and among themselves, in terms of country-of-origin effect and ethnocentrism. Design/methodology/approach: A multidisciplinary literature review pointed to a set of hypotheses regarding the differences between biculturals (Mexican Americans) and monoculturals (Mexicans and Americans), and between bicultural groups (integrating biculturals versus alternating biculturals). Two pilot tests and two experiments were conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings: Bicultural Mexican Americans are less ethnocentric than either American or Mexican monoculturals; exhibit more favorable quality evaluation and purchase intention toward American brands than Mexican monoculturals; and exhibit more favorable quality evaluation and purchase intention toward Mexican brands than American monoculturals. Although ethnocentrism does not significantly demarcate alternating biculturals from their integrating counterparts, alternators are more likely than integrators to provide a favorable evaluation of foreign brands and entertain the intention to purchase them. Research limitations/implications: As a starting-point for understanding the bicultural consumer, this study is subject to exploratory research limitations. Originality/value: The country-of-origin literature implicitly assumes that consumers identify with either the country where the product is originated or the country where it is sold. This assumption, however, might not hold for ethnic groups who identify with both countries. Such bicultural consumers might identify with the product's origin country as well as target country and, therefore, be less amenable to the country-of-origin hypothesis. We address this important research gap. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Today’s diverse society often includes culturally rich environments that contain cues pertaining to more than one culture. These cultural cues can shape cognitive processes, such as creativity. Recent evidence shows that bicultural experience enhances creativity, and that for culture-related domains, this effect is particularly evident among biculturals who blend their two cultural identities. The present study tested whether enhanced creativity among more blended biculturals was due to increased idea generation (i.e., ideational fluency). Moreover, the authors tested whether these effects generalized to noncultural domains, which may indicate that bicultural experience enhances creativity in broader arenas. One hundred seventy-seven Chinese Americans completed a creativity task in either a monocultural or bicultural context (manipulated via Chinese or American symbols or both). Greater bicultural identity blendedness predicted domain-general creativity in bicultural but not in monocultural contexts, and this was mediated by ideational fluency. Implications for enhancing creativity in our diverse society are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to provide recommendations to teacher educators in terms of structuring service-learning experiences in ways that promote beliefs and help preservice teachers develop the skills necessary to be effective with English language learners (ELLs). Teacher education is at a crucial juncture as the demographic makeup of current students is changing rapidly, resulting in a need to reexamine teacher education in light of these shifts. For example, the percentage of minority students in K-12 public schools increased from 33% in 1990 to 46% in 2010, whereas only 16.5% of teachers reported belonging to minority groups in 2007-2008, and most do not have the experience of becoming proficient in a second language, the kind of experience that may help them relate to the learning histories of their students. This disparity raises concern about the limited abilities of those with monocultural and monolingual experiences when they view and value the perspectives of their students from other cultural backgrounds. Additionally, many preservice teachers believe they are not as capable of instructing students who differ from themselves in terms of race or language as they do those from their own cultural backgrounds.

Abstract = {The traditional model of literacy coaching makes great sense in monocultural and monolingual settings; however, in multicultural and linguistically diverse settings, we suggest a broadened approach in order to achieve culturally responsive coaching. This chapter provides two case examples of developing literacy coaches who learn about others through stories and experiences presented with the ABCs of Cultural Understanding framework. In particular, we examine how the ABCs model helps literacy coaches learn to work effectively in diverse settings. Based on experiences with in-service teachers and those who are in the process of becoming literacy coaches, all of the components in a traditional literacy coaching model need to revolve around the cultural and linguistic needs of communities and schools. While there is a strong rationale for literacy coaching positions, and guidelines that define effective literacy coaching, what is often missing is a conversation about literacy coaches' abilities to talk across race and class lines. Specifically, to be effective when relating to teachers, students, administrators, and the community; literacy coaches must be able to have cross-cultural conversations to learn with and from others.

Abstract = {This article describes some valuable resources, especially those available on the web, which can assist in conducting cross-national survey research. Cross-national survey research is a complex and challenging endeavor. Designing a reliable and valid comparative study is notably more difficult than constructing a single monolingual/monocultural survey. Besides the whole array of components that encompass total-survey error in one survey, there is a parallel set of comparison errors that apply in cross-national surveys. Likewise, comparative analysis is complicated by these comparison errors, and even well-conducted comparative surveys may produce erroneous results due to failing to achieve functional equivalence at the design, collection, and/ or analysis stages. Even locating cross-national data for secondary analysis can be a challenge. The best overall resource for conducting cross-national survey research is the Cross-Cultural Survey Guidelines (CCSG). CCSG is frequently updated, and a comprehensive revision is underway with release scheduled for 2015. Besides the major archives and the catalogues and search tools designed to access their holdings, there are the websites maintained by individual cross-national programs.

Abstract = {Identity development is conceptualized as a series of distinct stages in the developmental pathway, including acquisition of self-knowledge, establishment of independence and personal continuity, and acquisition of a sense of affiliation. For those negotiating more than one cultural/racial/ethnic identity, a unique set of stages may be undertaken in the development of identity, particularly during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Although the sociocultural factors that shape identity development are relatively well-conceptualized, much less well understood are the biological mechanisms that facilitate identity development throughout the lifespan for both majority and minority group members. This chapter discusses sociocultural and biological pathways of identity development through the lens of cultural neuroscience, elucidating how dynamic culture-biology interactions shape the development of social identity in majority and minority group members and the etiology underlying adaptive social development in people living in monocultural and diverse multicultural communities.

Abstract = {Studies indicate that Latino immigrant youths engage in a wide range of sophisticated literacy practices outside of school that are often transnational, crossing various linguistic, cultural, and social spaces. However, Latino immigrant youths drop out of U.S. schools at disproportional rates, suggesting that their literacy practices are not recognized or valued by the educational system. This collective case study investigated the range, form, and purpose of the Out‐of‐School literacies of four Latina/o adolescent English learners who are new arrivals. Findings demonstrated that the most prevalent out‐of‐School literacies that the participants practice take place on the social networking site Facebook, in their workplaces, and through entertainment media sources. A cross‐case analysis suggests that the literacy practices in these spaces have unique and purposeful roles for the individuals that allow them to connect to their home countries and maintain their Latina/o identities. Additionally, the participants use their out‐of‐school literacy practices to acquire English, support themselves, and establish a place to succeed. The five aforementioned spaces that their Facebook, workplace, and entertainment literacy practices fill are virtually absent from their in‐school literacies. This study suggests that literacy pedagogy must not continue to impose a narrow monolingual, monocultural, monoliterate, and monomodal view of Latina/o immigrant students that essentially divests them of their greatest resources. Their literacy practices demonstrate that they are emerging as multilingual, multiliterate, and multicultural transnationals who competently engage in multimodal means of communication.

It notes that Japan's economic success in the latter part of the twentieth century was achieved with Japanese as the medium of instruction and observes that in terms of ideology and cultural politics at least, there are inherent contradictions with recent moves to have academic courses taught in English. Dominant motifs marking attitudes and practices relating to language, culture and to Japan's dealings with the world beyond Japanese shores are initially examined vis-à-vis the larger situ of a Japan that continues to live down the consequences of post-war occupation and the conservative politics that ensued, circumstances that have bolstered narratives of Japan as a predominantly monolingual and monocultural nation. This is followed by a discussion on how various ideological as well as macro- and micro-political forces bear on the use of English for content instruction. Finally, it will be noted that the present state of affairs calls for deeper thought and critical scrutiny – if recent initiatives towards having more English in higher education are not to be found for superficiality or even a lack of sincerity.

Abstract = {The article examines two key concepts in research on policy borrowing and lending that are often used to explain why and how educational reforms travel across national boundaries: reception and translation. The studies on reception analyse the political, economic, and cultural reasons that account for the attractiveness of a reform from elsewhere. Translation, in turn, captures the act of local adaptation, modification, or re-framing of an imported reform. Strikingly, in most cases the act of policy borrowing is deterritorialized and draws on broadly defined international standards or “best practices”. The exceptions are references to the league leaders in international student achievement tests such as, most recently, Singapore, Finland, and Shanghai. The article makes the argument that policy analysts in other countries only emulate the system features of league leaders if it fits their own domestic policy agenda. Furthermore, there is a new body of research emerging in comparative education that investigates the country-specific projections into the educational systems of the league leaders. Finally, the article points to the “yes, but …” phenomenon in cases where there is resistance to learn, adopt or borrow from league leaders. It is in such moments of resistance to change that policy makers tend to highlight fundamental differences by insisting that the contexts are not sufficiently comparable to learn a useful lesson: Finland is too monocultural, Shanghai too urban, and Singapore relies too much on private tutoring to be relevant for lesson drawing.

Four major groups of fundamental issues are discussed: conceptual, measurement, procedural, and practical. The conceptual issues relate to the nature of interview data, potential sources of problems, and sample size. Next, it is shown how the SSCI method can be used to informally evaluate validity, reliability, and cross-cultural equivalence. This is followed by the procedural steps and the practical issues in implementing cross-national SSCI studies. Some methodological and practical limitations are also noted.

Material: Mexican immigrants have lower rates of psychopathology than the US population. This is less true for Cubans and not true for Puerto Ricans. The ‘advantage’ also occurs in other groups. Biculturals have better mental health and endorse both cultures.

Abstract = {To explore the possible cognitive consequences of biculturalism, the authors examine the complexity of cultural representations in monocultural and bicultural individuals. Study 1 found that Chinese American biculturals' free descriptions of both American and Chinese cultures are higher in cognitive complexity than that of Anglo-American monoculturals, but the same effect was not apparent in descriptions of culturally neutral entities (landscapes). With the same procedures, Study 2 found that the cultural representations of biculturals with low levels of Bicultural Identity Integration (BII; or biculturals with conflicted cultural identities) are more cognitively complex than that of biculturals with high BII (biculturals with compatible cultural identities). This article shows that cultural frame switching and BII have meaningful cognitive consequences; furthermore, it suggests that exposure to more than one culture may increase individuals' ability to detect, process, and organize everyday cultural meaning, highlighting the potential benefits of multiculturalism.

Abstract = {Poland—a country situated between eastern and western Europe. Polish people are a nation torn between eastern emotionalism, impulsivity, and western rationalism, cautiousness—a buffer between eastern and western Europe. It is a country whose identity is constantly changing; formerly multicultural (including Poles, Ukrainians, Belamsians, Jews, Tatars, Lithuanians, and Armenians) it is nowadays monocultural. Poland is a Catholic state situated between the eastern Orthodox Church and western Protestantism. Geographically located in the center of Europe, for centuries it had to defend its borders, a country that still remembers its past power that used to reach from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The same country that was later geographically annihilated, absorbed, balancing between existence and nonexistence. "A seasonal state (saisonstaat)"—as Germans ironically called it after the World War One. The theme of constantly redefining its self-image and re-establishing its borders seems to be a leitmotiv of Polish history. Settling the Polish borders after World War One, and the fact that the borders were approved by Germany in 1989, constitutes a very important factor in the current image of Poles and Poland. Modern Poland and Polish people are like a newly discovered Self that derives energy from its clear definition and from memories of its difficult past that remind Poles how bad things can get. Can Poland and Poles be compared to a patient who has won a fight for his own identity within his own borders? A patient who has recovered from borderline syndrome that has lasted for centuries? In the following, we would like to discuss whether and to what extent the metaphor of a borderline personality—with its weak self, a tendency to split objects into good, idealized, and bad, devalued—is an adequate illustration of the historical process of building the identity of Poland and of its people.

Abstract = {While social identity challenges probably confront all school administrators, the authors focus on a doubly marginalized leadership population—Black female principals—whose experiences are rarely tapped. Based on lessons from this study and the literature reviewed, the authors think that leadership preparation programs should give prospective administrators opportunities to gain knowledge and develop skills relevant to navigating their leadership identities. In the age of accountability, and with the pressures placed on the education system to ensure the success of all students, school leaders are under constant scrutiny. The appearance, speech, body language, and interactions of principals with students, parents, teachers, and community members are dissected. Stretching to satisfy expectations, many principals find themselves trying to conform to a predefined image. Work pressures like these prove immeasurably intense for many Black women. Society has subscribed to certain beliefs about different groups, and these beliefs affect the roles, responsibilities, and identities of the individuals. They can have a positive or negative influence. Many principals have created professional identities that they have fine-tuned and learned to steer Trial and error has helped them learn identity-fitting techniques, while other principals may still be learning how to effectively manage people, address supporters and nonsupporters, and be politically savvy. Regardless of how they develop their identity, principals work toward inventing and branding themselves, fulfilling public identities (e.g., caregiver) and trying out new identities, such as commander-and-chief. Black female principals must navigate their identities as bicultural beings with different stakeholder groups and within work spaces that are traditionally geared to monocultural White males.

Koreans and European Americans differed in their conflict resolution styles in a manner congruent with individualism-collectivism theory. Korean Americans displayed a complex bicultural pattern of conflict resolution: They endorsed “competing” (a traditionally individualistic style) more than Koreans and similar to European Americans, while also endorsing "avoidance" (a traditionally collectivistic style) more than both European Americans and Koreans.

Abstract = {The present article focused on two types of communicative intent (directing behaviour vs. eliciting talk) expressed by mothers and teenagers during everyday family interactions in Estonian, Finnish, and Swedish mono- and bicultural families. Three monocultural groups consisted of 17 Estonian, 19 Swedish, and 18 Finnish families living in their country of origin; two bicultural and bilingual groups consisted of 18 Estonian and 18 Finnish families residing in Sweden. All the children were between 9.0 and 13.0. The results revealed that the Estonian monocultural mothers were highly directive and direct: issuing behavioural directives most frequently and using the highest proportion of imperatives among all samples. Contrary to our expectations, the mothers who tended to be more concerned with controlling their children's behaviour also elicited conversation more frequently from teenagers by using a larger number of information requests. These requests seemed to serve as another form of attempted control over adolescents' behaviour--their communicative behaviour. The Swedish monocultural children were more active in controlling their mothers' behaviour than their counterparts, possibly illustrating the Swedish value of generational equality.

Abstract = {In a series of interviews with leading cross-cultural management (CCM) educators, we examine the state of the CCM field within business education. We invited eight prominent scholars and executive educators to consider the following main questions: What is the role of cross-cultural management in business curricula? What challenges do we face teaching this material? How can we create an engaged learning environment with the diverse audiences we encounter in our classrooms, and what theoretical frameworks best support these efforts? Last what is the future of cross-cultural management education? What changes and challenges can we expect? The learnings that emerged from our interviews are grouped around three main themes: the content of what we teach, our understanding of audiences with whom we work and their evolving expectations of cross-cultural management education, and the role, preparation, background and assumptions of the educators. This series of interviews contributes to highlight current trends in cross-cultural management education: a shift in content from knowledge to conditions of knowledge creation, a transition from monocultural audiences toward biculturals and global cosmopolitans, and finally, educators' changing responsibility from providing knowledge to developing and honing responsible, tolerant, and resilient global citizens.

Abstract = {The top 86 students were selected from a pool of approximately 400 applicants to a summer clinical psychology research training program for undergraduate students of color. Forty-three of the students were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 clinical psychology research training programs, and 43 were randomly assigned to a control condition without training. The multicultural version of the training program emphasized the cultural context of psychology in all areas of training, whereas cultural context was de-emphasized in the monocultural version of the program. Although the cultural content of the 2 training programs was effectively manipulated as indicated by a fidelity check by an outside expert, there were no significant differences between the effects of the 2 programs on the outcomes measured in this study. The primary differences in this study were between students who did versus those who did not participate in a training program. Sixty-five percent of the students who completed the multicultural training program applied to graduate schools in psychology, compared with 47% of those who completed the monocultural training program, and 31% of those in the control group. Participation in summer research training programs also increased self-perceptions of multicultural competence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the effects of contact with Gypsies on prejudice and its affective and cognitive components in their Italian classmates. Via a repeated measure quasi-experimental design multicultural classes that also included Gypsy children were compared with monocultural classes made up only of Italian children. A questionnaire was distributed at the beginning and at the end of the school year to the same pupils (n = 133). Main results indicate that, at the beginning of the school year, evaluation of Gypsies is more positive in the multicultural classes but worsens over the school year while it remains stable in monocultural classes. Over the school year perception of parents' attitude and positive emotions toward Gypsies also decrease in multicultural classes whereas negative emotions remain the same. At the end of the school year pupils from all classes report greater school difficulties due to the presence of Gypsy children in class, decrease social interactions with them and have a less positive Gypsy stereotype. These negative effects on school integration are discussed in light of the psychosocial literature on interethnic contact effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Building upon recent research that defines psychological development as a continuous process of sense-making situated within a cultural and historical context, this paper explores how culturally diverse youth growing up in New York City use evaluative language to enact relational complexity as they make sense of technologically mediated interpersonal interactions with their peers. Forty-four individuals (ages 15–20) participated in a quasi-experimental research workshop that engaged them in the process of sense-making by asking them to write projective narratives toward a vignette depicting text-massage mediated interpersonal interaction embedded among monocultural and bicultural group of peers. Data analyses focus on evaluative devices used by youth and manifest the relational flexibility of sense-making by immigrant youth and their U.S. born peers across diverse relational dimensions. Results suggest that immigrant youth are able to coordinate diverse ways of interpreting interpersonal interactions across relational dimensions, manifest by varied use of logical/hypothetical, causal and affective evaluative devices. In contrast U.S. born youth largely use same frequency of evaluative devices across two relational dimensions. Statistical analysis highlights the use of affect in projective narratives by exploring a discursive learning hypothesis: that higher use of emotions in the process of sense-making by U.S. born youth gradually scaffolds the use of emotions in narrative by immigrant youth.

Abstract = {An ethic of care acknowledges the centrality of the role of caring relationships in moral education. Care ethics requires a conception of ‘care’ that differs from the quotidian use of the word. In order to teach care ethics more effectively, this article discusses four interrelated ways that teachers’ understandings of care differ from care ethics: (1) conflating the term of reference ‘care’ with its quotidian use; (2) overlooking the challenge of developing caring relationships; (3) tending toward monocultural understandings of care; and (4) separating affect and intellect. Awareness of these conceptions of care supports teacher educators to teach care ethics in more meaningful and relevant ways. We explore stories and their dramatization as a medium to facilitate effective and in-depth teaching of care ethics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

The Guardian. Available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/15/worst-place-womenafghanistan- india). Somali women refugees, particularly those living in the South of Somalia, face heightened possibility of rape and sexual humiliation, and are subject to everchanging religious restrictions and punishments (Abdi, C. M. (2005). In limbo: Dependency, insecurity and identity amongst Somali refugees in Dadaab camps, Refuge: Canada’s Periodical on Refugees, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 6–14; The New York Times, 2011). Some of the latest religious restrictions are that bras are forbidden and women must purchase specific clothing from stores owned by religious leaders. Also, pregnancy out of wedlock, which includes pregnancy as a result of rape, is forbidden and punishable by stoning (BBC (2009, November). Somali woman stoned for adultery. Available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8366197.stm). A recent 2011 Sharia law bans unrelated men and women from shaking hands, walking or talking together in public.

After settling in Canada, these past traumas intersect with the resettlement challenges faced by Somali women refugees. This often produces healthrelated issues that women struggle to overcome—within a monocultural medical system that is not always responsive to their needs (Danso, 2002; Galabuzi, G. E. (2002, November). Social exclusion. A paper and presentation given at The Social Determinants of Health across the Life-Span Conference, Toronto, ON; Bokore, 2009). This paper explores the connections between trauma and resettlement in the lives of Somali-Canadian women, and how this can in turn effect the next generation via ‘intergenerational trauma’. Through personal experience, community-based conversations and existent trauma research, I will then outline how social workers can respond to this unique nexus of needs.

Abstract = {The ways in which national prototypes are defined constitute an important symbolic resource for maintaining hierarchy between groups within society. Two studies examined how New Zealanders downplayed or emphasized inclusionary versus exclusionary features of the national prototype. Study 1 tested a structural equation model indicating that people high in Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) rated monocultural features that best fit an exclusionary (Anglo/European) ideal as characteristic of the national prototype (citizenship and ancestry, rugby/sporting culture). Simultaneously, people high in SDO also rated pluralistic features that were inclusive as less important for the national prototype (cultural awareness, liberal democratic values; n = 95). Study 2 replicated and extended these opposing effects to show that they held controlling for Right-Wing Authoritarianism and patriotism (n = 258). People high in the competitive-driven motivation for group-based hierarchy and inequality position representations of the national prototype in ways that privilege some groups over others in defining who constitutes a ‘true’ citizen. This likely helps legitimize various subtle discriminatory and exclusionary practices directed toward recent immigrant groups, to the extent that such groups are seen as not really ‘belonging’ to the nation.

Abstract = {This third paper on older people nursing and spirituality moves beyond the literature reviewed in the two previous papers, exploring directions for the practice and continuing research in this field. Issues of chronic illness challenge nurses working with older people to focus on continuing health promotion and opportunities for spiritual promotion of resilience and transcendence. The changes from monocultural to multicultural societies challenge nurses to know how to provide culturally and faith appropriate care. The extension of palliative care to the needs of those growing older and dying is noted as an important area for developing spiritual care. It is asserted that spiritual assessment forms a basis for the provision of spiritual care for all of these themes. Ethical perspectives of older people nursing must be carefully addressed as frail and vulnerable older people struggle with issues of compromised autonomy. Further research should focus on spirituality as seen through the eyes of older people and examine the interface between nurses and patients, where the relationship becomes the guiding basis for practice. Education in nursing courses and through continuing programmes of education is needed to ensure adequate understanding of spirituality in the nursing role.

Abstract = {This chapter examines transitions from a monocultural perspective toward a multicultural perspective embodied in a model for education, training, and professional practice in psychology. A rich history of Child and Adolescent Service System Program advocacy, followed by exemplars, demonstrations, practice models and guidelines, chronicled the development and implementation of a multicultural perspective. The development of a multicultural perspective was accompanied by an increasing diversity of students, faculty, and professional service providers. At present, however, multicultural education is imperfectly represented in professional psychology training programs and by services in the public and private sectors. The recent Cube Model is a contemporary stimulus toward more coherent, comprehensive, and competency-oriented education in training programs incorporating a multicultural perspective. The Cube Model foundational domain of individual and cultural diversity was fleshed out by an expansion of the counseling psychology triadic training model to include California Brief Multicultural Competence Scale (CBMCS) measurement of a fourth factor, Sociocultural Diversities. This new factor extends the conceptualization of multicultural competency to include multiple identities and contexts represented by the poor, aged, disabled, gender, and gay/lesbian populations. The CBMCS is one component of the Multicultural Assessment-Intervention Process (MAIP) practice model for systematically including multicultural issues in services and service delivery. A multicultural competency training model complements the Cube Model by articulating components germane to multicultural education. These components address implementation within training programs by selection of students, more comprehensive competency-oriented training employing diverse modalities, and routine evaluation of educational-training outcomes. Two illustrative programs suggest how these components can be incorporated into graduate training. These programs articulate both the difficulties and the promise of training agendas that incorporate both Cube Model components and CBMCS/MAIP procedures into multicultural education.

The extent of considering cultural competency initiatives for multicultural populations within each profession was determined by self-scrutiny, or "reflexivity," within a larger context of hierarchal status, special interests, disparate objectives, and membership needs. Values of autonomy and self-sufficiency inherent in each discipline minimized formal interdisciplinary exchange of ideas or partnering in the development of complementary training experiences for professional practice with diverse populations. This chapter examines overarching education and training considerations in these professional disciplines that have sustained historic monocultural activities and minimized reflexivity in the development of multicultural perspectives. These considerations have placed limits on the (a) scientific premises and activities providing a coherent basis of knowledge for practice; (b) discipline permeability for racial/ethnic minorities and balanced representation by gender; and (c) openness of the discipline to cross-cultural exchange of ideas, practices, and working alliances on a global basis. For each professional discipline, basic scientific premises and activities are examined within a context of racial/ethnic minority and gender representation. These disciplines occupy different positions on dimensions of science, critical membership ratios for minorities and gender, and especially on the extent of transition from monocultural to multicultural perspectives. Globalization has dramatically affected international communication, information exchange, and cooperative affiliations. These professional disciplines have responded differently to globalization. Global outreach is at different levels of prioritization and development within each profession. This chapter identifies common themes and problems across disciplines that curtail increased respect and cooperative interdisciplinary alliances national and international objectives.

Abstract = {Examined the relation between cultural contact and psychological aspects associated with cultural identity, as conceptualized in 2 research approaches: social identity theory and acculturation research. The groups studied were German and US American Ss (aged 16–70 yrs) who either lived in the respective nonnative culture (biculturals) or had no direct contact (monoculturals). A total of 291 Ss provided information about their sociocultural backgrounds and their cultural experiences, and they rated how characteristic each of 120 trait-attributes was of themselves, their native cultural group, and their nonnative cultural group. Comparisons between monocultural and bicultural groups revealed a reaffirmation effect. Compared with monoculturals, biculturals saw themselves as more similar to their native cultural group, they evaluated that particular group's attributes more positively, and they saw the 2 cultural groups as less similar to each other.

Bicultural participants of Greek descent who live in the Netherlands were randomly primed with either Greek or Dutch cultural symbols and language. A monocultural Dutch group in the Netherlands and a monocultural Greek group in Greece, were involved as control groups. Structural equation modeling indicated that the Greek participants in Greece and the bicultural participants primed with Greek culture had a similar pattern of associations. This pattern differed from that of the Dutch participants and the participants primed with Dutch culture. Thus, the two different monocultural association patterns were replicated among bicultural individuals. The findings show that meanings are affected by cultural frame-switching, and provide further support for the dynamic constructivist approach.

Abstract = {Current knowledge about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) families has developed mainly in a Euro-American (Westernized) cultural context, which, although characterized by diversity, represents a fairly monocultural perspective on LGBT families. When examining research from a non-Western perspective, factors such as globalization, geographical location, social and cultural frameworks regarding race, language, and religion, and localized understandings of gender, sex, and sexuality need to be recognized. This chapter briefly explores the historical background of same-sex-oriented people within non-Westernized cultures, to account for the possible presence and existence of LGBT-parent families, as well as to provide a background against which the diversity and complexities of same-sex practices in various cultures influence the way LGBT families should be considered. After this overview, research from five regions is explored along significant signposts of gender, heteronormativity, the legal and political framework, and religious influences.

The qualitative research has made use of Atlas-ti to understand the transformation of “making therapy” from a monocultural world to a multicultural world. The study has pointed out how therapists deeply need to update their own intervention and how this change occurs at different levels: epistemological, theorical, methodological. Within a multicultural environment the therapy looks to request a clinical practice that is able to vary its own means to more extensively interconnect with patients, clients, users having problems, expectations, perspectives different from those sharing the same cultural background. The reasearch eventually shows how the migrants bring in plenty of new therapy issues and urge into reckoning the therapy not anymore as a treatment but as a “health project”.

This interesting book compares the phenomena of suicide across cultures. The authors tear us away from our monocultural, ethnocentric perspectives in the United States by pointing out the stark differences in suicidal patterns in different cultures This book underscores the reality that behavior has many determinants. It also highlights some universal drivers of risky behavior, such as social disorganization, cultural conflict, and the breakdown of the family. However, protective factors, may mitigate these pressures. In the conclusion, the editors cite 3 recent books concluding that "there is no sound research evidence that psychiatric disorders are caused by dysfunctional neurotransmitter, systems in the brain, and second, that psychiatric medications are no better than active placebos in helping patients."

Abstract = {With the goal to facilitate cultural competency development of students enrolled in graduate-level health professional education, this study examined the effectiveness of a curricular program guided by the Intercultural Developmental Continuum (IDC) as measured by the Intercultural Developmental Inventory (IDl). The IDl was administered to 17 occupational therapy (OT) students and a control group of 25 non-OT health professional students upon matriculation into their respective programs of graduate study and again upon completion of 3 years of study. OT students participated in a cultural curricular design guided by the IDC, while the control group participated in cultural study not guided by the IDC. Though OT students did not show a significant change in overall developmental orientation mean scores from pre-test to post-test (t = 0.847, p = 0.41), the results indicate that the designed intercultural curriculum increased intercultural competence among those OT students who began their program with the monocultural mindset of polarization (an "us vs. them" evaluative viewpoint) and moved to the interculturally transitional mindset of minimization (recognizing cultural commonalities and elimination of the "us vs. them" mindset). The control group showed a significant decrease in developmental orientation mean scores at post-test (t = 6.1, p < 0.001). No significant group or group by baseline interaction effects were found when comparing overall postdevelopmental scores adjusting for baseline (F = 2.4, ρ = 0.131). The curriculum design as guided by the IDC, though it did not significantly increase overall cultural competency of OT students, appears to have mitigated a decrease in competence. Results suggest that the cultural challenges that students face appear to be considerable arid, without targeted, integrated intercultural preparation, can overwhelm new health professionals' intercultural capability.

Abstract = {The global mental health (GMH) research agenda should include both culture-general and culture-specific perspectives to ensure ecological validity of findings. Despite its title, the current GMH research agenda appears to be using a monocultural model that is individualistic, illness-oriented, and focused on intrapsychic processes. Ironically, issues of culture are prominently absent in many discussions of global mental health. This paper highlights some issues and concerns considered key to conducting ecologically valid and socially responsible GMH research. The concerns are particularly directed at researchers from dominant cultures who are working in low-income countries. Central to these issues is the balance between etic and emic perspectives in assessment, diagnosis, and intervention, as well as language, engagement of stakeholders and their agendas, and evaluation of the benefit of interventions to the community. New terminology is proposed that identifies broad cultural groups, and recommendations provided for a research agenda to encourage both basic and applied research that mutually benefits all stakeholders in the GMH research endeavor.

Abstract = {Seventeen years ago Gloria Ladson-Billings (1995) published the landmark article “Toward a Theory of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy,” giving a coherent theoretical statement for resource pedagogies that had been building throughout the 1970s and 1980s. I, like countless teachers and university-based researchers, have been inspired by what it means to make teaching and learning relevant and responsive to the languages, literacies, and cultural practices of students across categories of difference and (in)equality. Recently, however, I have begun to question if the terms “relevant” and “responsive” are really descriptive of much of the teaching and research founded upon them and, more importantly, if they go far enough in their orientation to the languages and literacies and other cultural practices of communities marginalized by systemic inequalities to ensure the valuing and maintenance of our multiethnic and multilingual society. In this essay, I offer the term and stance of culturally sustaining pedagogy as an alternative that, I believe, embodies some of the best research and practice in the resource pedagogy tradition and as a term that supports the value of our multiethnic and multilingual present and future. Culturally sustaining pedagogy seeks to perpetuate and foster—to sustain—linguistic, literate, and cultural pluralism as part of the democratic project of schooling. In the face of current policies and practices that have the explicit goal of creating a monocultural and monolingual society, research and practice need equally explicit resistances that embrace cultural pluralism and cultural equality.

Abstract = {In this article, drawing on qualitative interviews and documentary analysis, we argue that the Jewish community in Britain has undergone a fundamental shift since 1990 from a ‘strategy of security’, a strategy of communal leadership based on emphasizing the secure British citizenship and belonging of the UK’s Jews, to a ‘strategy of insecurity’, where the communal leadership instead stresses an excess of security among Anglo-Jewry. We demonstrate this based on two case studies: of the Jewish renewal movement in the 1990s and the ‘new antisemitism’ phenomenon of the 2000s. We conclude that this shift is tied to the shift from a monocultural Britain to an officially multicultural one, and that therefore there are lessons that can be taken from it for the study of British and other multiculturalisms.

Abstract = {This article discusses a study that examined cultural frame switching among bicultural Greek participants living in the Netherlands. The research demonstrated that self-evaluations, self-stereotypes, and attitudes toward family integrity and friendship were affected by cultural framing. Experimentally primed bicultural participants and monocultural comparison groups in the Netherlands and Greece were used. Activating Greek culture especially, in comparison to activating Dutch culture, led to a less positive evaluation of the personal self, stronger Greek self-stereotyping, and stronger endorsement of family integrity and friendship. Similar differences were found when comparing monocultural Dutch and monocultural Greek participants. In addition, cultural priming affected group identification, which was found to be associated with perceptions and attitudes. The pattern of results suggests that group identification, in part, mediates the relationship between cultural framing and perceptual and evaluative responses. It is concluded that social identity principles are important for understanding the experiences of bicultural individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This research examines the mediating role of emotions implicated in the multicultural experience—creativity link. We propose that when individuals are dealing with apparent cultural contradictions upon encountering two cultures simultaneously, mentally juxtaposing dissonant cultural stimuli could lower positive affect or increase negative affect, which could in turn induce a deeper level of cognitive processing of cultural discrepancies and inspire creativity. Two studies compared dual cultural exposure versus single cultural exposure among bicultural Singaporeans (Study 1) and compared self-relevant (jointly presenting local and foreign cultures) versus self-irrelevant (jointly presenting foreign cultures only) dual cultural exposure among monocultural Taiwanese (Study 2). As in past research, dual cultural exposure promotes creativity, particularly if one presented culture is self-relevant. Further, this effect was mediated by a less positive or a more negative emotional state. These findings illuminate the underlying influence of emotions activated by simultaneous exposure to diverse cultures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This issue of International Journal of Social Research Methodology: Theory & Practice focuses on the management of the decline of globalized methodology. The limits of globalization are evident in many fields, from economy to politics, from marketing to culture. Methodology is not free from these limits. However while European or US societies are becoming more and more multicultural, many methodologists and researchers still use monocultural methods. Moreover these colonial methods are still applied in non-Western countries with little reflexivity. Consequently these traditional methods do not capture the richness of meanings embedded in opinions, attitudes, and actions of participants under study. There is an emerging need to find postcolonial methodologies when working with multicultural populations, in order to make culturally flexible contemporary research methods. The attempt to decolonize contemporary methodology requires a reflexive investigation of what are the common-sense assumptions, conceptions or ideologies behind research methods, both quantitative and qualitative. Starting from this reflection methodology and research methods need to be recreated in order to suit the local cultures. Irrelevance is associated with methodology presented as universal and context-free as seen in textbooks uncritically exported around the globe.

Abstract = {This study investigates the link between motivational and affective experiences in the daily life of bicultural individuals. Employing a diary design, the authors examined the role of cultural identification in the dynamic goal–affect association in East-Asian Canadian biculturals. Using multilevel modeling procedures, the authors found that momentary cultural identification systematically moderated the association between extrinsic motivation and Negative Affect (NA) over time. Similar to previous findings observed from monocultural Westerners, biculturals in this study showed a positive association between extrinsic motivation and NA when they identified with Western culture. When they identified with Asian culture, however, biculturals' extrinsic motivation was not linked to NA, suggesting that when their Asian identity is salient, they are less negatively influenced by extrinsic goal pursuit than when they identified with Western culture. Findings indicate the importance of within-individual short-term variations in cultural identification for understanding the affective implications of extrinsic motivation in the lives of bicultural individuals.

Abstract = {Migrations have intensified with the advent of globalisation. Societies once solidly monocultural are becoming increasingly multicultural. It is, however, not clear how social capital would travel across cultural boundaries. A multicultural environment might result on agents preferring to interact with those of their own culture, discriminating against others. We study trust, an aspect of social capital, between domestic Australian students of non-Asian origin and international students of Asian origin. To measure the degree of trust and patterns of discrimination between these groups, the Berg et al. (1995) trust game and a series of control games were used in framework where each participant played each game against several partners knowing their domestic or international status. Controlling for individual heterogeneity, domestic students significantly discriminated against international students in the trust game, and individual discrimination was taste-based rather than based on beliefs towards international students’ trustworthiness. Moreover, the average amount that international students sent in the trust game was negatively related with the number of semesters studied at university in Australia, which may partly reflect cultural adjustment but also institutional disadvantages faced specifically by international students. The study furthers understanding of the patterns of discrimination between domestic and international university students and the nature of this discrimination.

Abstract = {In this issue of the Journal, Pinkham et al. (see record [rid]2008-06006-020[/rid]) report findings on own-race and other-race effects in their research on facial recognition in schizophrenia. The authors found that the capacity to recognize and remember emotions in faces is no different between Caucasians and African Americans, whether they have schizophrenia or not. But memory for the faces and discrimination of emotions in them are higher when the study subject is of the same race as the person expressing the facial emotion. As did the mental health report on culture, race, and ethnicity from former Surgeon General David Satcher, this study underscores the unfortunate reality that "monocultural ethnocentrism" continues to pervade "good science" in psychiatric research. Aside from the important scientific information Pinkham et al. have elicited, for me this study's greatest contribution to the literature is in showing why, despite legitimate reasons for being suspicious of research, African Americans need to volunteer to participate in research studies and why scientists need to diversify the culture, race, and ethnicity of their research subjects. Until researchers learn to correct the problems emphasized in Guthrie's book Even the Rat Was White, our science will be lacking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants were interviewed in the language of their choice concerning their level of symptomatology (i.e., depression, anxiety, somatization, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity), language acculturation, monocultural involvement (assessed by separate adherence to American and Puerto Rican cultural values), and dual cultural involvement (assessed by a combination of cultural values). Results indicated that biculturality significantly predicted adjustment above and beyond monocultural involvement. In addition, although biculturality and bilingualism were both significantly related to psychological adjustment, linguistic balance showed a stronger association with adjustment than biculturality.

Abstract = {Intercultural competence/sensitivity is increasingly recognized across the global spectrum of educational institutions, corporations, government agencies and non-government organizations as a central capability for the 21st century. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) is an assessment tool that measures the level of intercultural competence/sensitivity across a developmental continuum for individuals, groups, and organizations and represents a theoretically grounded measure of this capability for perceiving cultural differences and commonalities and modifying behavior to cultural context. This study represents additional cross-cultural validity testing of the IDI, building on the previous work of Paige, Jacobs-Cassuto, Yershova, and DeJaeghere (2003) and Hammer, Bennett, and Wiseman (2003). The 50 items from IDI v2 were administered to 4763 individuals from 11 distinct, cross-cultural samples. Confirmatory factor analysis confirms the following basic orientations toward cultural difference originally explicated by Bennett (1986, 1993) in the Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS): Denial, Defense, Reversal, Minimization, Acceptance, and Adaptation. In addition, it also identifies Cultural Disengagement as an additional scale within the IDI; but one that is not located along the developmental continuum. Second, the inter-scale correlations support the theoretically proposed, developmental formulation from Denial through Adaptation. Third, the current analysis offers strong support for an overall Developmental Orientation (DO) scale and an overall Perceived Orientation (PO) scale. Fourth, Minimization is found to be a transitional orientation toward cultural differences and commonalities, between the more monocultural (ethnocentric) orientations of Denial and Polarization (Defense, Reversal) and the more intercultural mindsets of Acceptance and Adaptation. Fifth, readability analysis indicates the IDI is appropriate for high (secondary) school students (age 15 or above) or individuals with a 10th grade reading level. Finally, criterion validity of the IDI was assessed. The results indicate that the IDI has strong predictive validity toward bottom-line goals within organizations; namely, the achievement of diversity and inclusion goals in the recruitment and staffing function. These findings complement previous results that demonstrated that the IDI also possesses strong content and construct validity across culture groups.

Although Personal Leadership was originally developed in the mid-1990s in the context of intercultural education and training to promote multicultural teamwork in the intern program of the Summer Institute for Intercultural Communication in Portland, Oregon, it has evolved into an approach that can be applied by people who want to inspire themselves to live and work more mindfully and creatively in any context. The reference section shows that in addition to intercultural communication, the sources that have informed the development of Personal Leadership also include education, leadership development, positive psychology, the biological and the quantum sciences, whole person self-development, and the wisdom traditions.

Abstract = {There is a compelling argument that universities should be committed to advancing the Indigenous agenda. With respect to social work, as well as to nursing, psychology, and allied health, this commitment is often translated into a single goal: that graduates should be "culturally competent". While acknowledging that there can be tactical advantages in pursuing this goal the current paper develops a practical critique of the expectation that cultural competence is an unproblematic "add on" to professional education. Using a single case study as an example—how the subject "individual development" is transmitted as a monocultural and unproblematic formation—we argue that it is impossible to learn to work cross-culturally without developing a capacity for reflective self-scrutiny. Less likely to be a flag of convenience than "cultural competence", an allegiance to "critical awareness" prompts the interrogation of received knowledge, for example how human development and personhood is understood, as well stimulating an engagement in the lifelong process of reflecting on one’s own ideological and cultural location.

Abstract = {Substantial variations have been found in the ways in which individuals within different cultural groups identify themselves. Typically, members of individualistic national cultures perceive themselves as more independent of others, while members of collectivistic national cultures perceive themselves as more interdependent with others. In early studies, self-construal was most frequently conceptualised as a relatively trait-like quality that could be measured by open-ended self-description or by self-report scales. To be validly employed, data from such measures need to be analysed in ways that take account of cultural differences in the tendency to acquiescent responding. Independent and interdependent self-construals have been found to correlate with cross-national differences in a wide variety of social behaviours. More recently, greater account has been taken of individuals' capacity to choose between a range of personal and social identities, dependent upon the salience of alternative social contexts. The effect of context is much greater among respondents from collectivistic cultures. The contrast between independent and interdependent self-construal has proved oversimple, and a range of alternatives has been proposed. A distinction between individual, relational and collective identities may more validly capture the range of cross-cultural variation. Given that self-construals are mutable, experimental priming techniques can be used to determine the extent to which variations in self-construal are able to cause effects that are equivalent to cultural differences in social cognition. Recent studies have focused primarily on bicultural respondents, and the utility of priming studies to explain differences between monocultural populations remains to be determined.

Abstract = {In Quebec, the link between national identity and literature has been a central question for a long time. This was particularly the case between the emergence of the idea of a national text in French at the beginning of the nineteenth century and the nationalist project of the so called Quiet Revolution at the beginning of the 1960s. It was not until the 1980s, after the "no" to Quebec sovereignty in the referendum of 1980, that Quebec literature entered a new era in terms of the relationship between literature and national identity. From the 1980s onwards, feminist writing, so called intimate writing and migrant literature would play central parts. Migrant literature is particularly interesting here, since it can be looked upon as a decisive change of focus in Quebec literature. So far, the literary canon had been determined by a monocultural French-speaking we. With the arrival of migrant literature new perspectives came in which were not always so easily integrated in what had previously been looked upon as Quebec national literature. Among the best known authors in Quebec migrant literature are Marco Micone, Ying Chen, Régine Robin, Dany Laferrière, Émile Ollivier, Wajdi Mouawad, and Marie-Célie Agnant.

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the value of teaching about mental illness through the use of literature. Design/methodology/approach: Using the examples of two colleges in eastern USA that focus on educating students for healthcare careers, the paper examines two different course formats for using literature to teach about mental illness: a course that places the topic within the larger context of medicine and literature; and a freestanding madness and literature course. Findings: While professional education tends towards specialization, it can lead to a monocultural vision that limits approaches to patients and problems alike. Courses integrating mental illness and literature were found to be effective means of counteracting this trend. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited to two healthcare-centred colleges in eastern USA. Practical implications: For mental health clinicians and healthcare professionals in general, literature broadens the scope of both perspectives and analytical tools for understanding mental disorders and responses to them. Originality/value: While literature courses often contain such themes as mental illness, courses that truly integrate literature with mental illness meet a growing need for interdisciplinary education as a means of preparing more flexibly thinking healthcare professionals.

Abstract = {New views of biculturalism have transformed the "melting pot" vision of American culture to one in which immigrants are encouraged to maintain multicultural diversity rather than assimilate to the dominant culture. Indeed, the marker of bicultural competence is now seen as the ability to display culturally appropriate behaviors in both the new and old cultural settings (e.g., LaFramboise, Coleman, & Gerton, 1993). Recent social cognitive research emphasizing both the shifting nature of the self (e.g., Gardner, Gabriel, & Lee, 1999) and of cultural world-views (e.g., Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martínez, 2000) can illuminate the mechanisms underlying this more dynamic form of biculturalism. The current research demonstrated bicultural flexibility by comparing monocultural (European-American) and bicultural (Asian- American) participants' self-construals, values, and responses to social obligations as a function of the situational accessibility of independent and interdependent self-construal. As expected, Asian-Americans appeared more responsive to the primes than their European-American counterparts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this research, I examined how biculturals, or individuals who have been equally influenced by an East Asian and Western cultural orientation, respond to various types of persuasion appeals that promote values unique to a particular culture. In the first experiment, I found that biculturals, relative to monoculturals, tend to react favorably toward both individually and interpersonally focused appeals due to their having 2 equally developed and accessible cultural dispositions. In the second experiment, I identified boundary conditions under which having relatively equal access to both cultural dispositions leads to favorable responses. Results indicate that biculturals who tend to compartmentalize each culture react less favorably toward appeals that are both individually and interpersonally focused than biculturals who tend to integrate the 2 cultures. In other words, the former type of bicultural prefers appeals that activate one cultural disposition, whereas the latter type of bicultural favors appeals that activate both cultural dispositions. These findings are discussed in light of the growing trend toward multiculturalism and the increasing need for researchers to understand the impact of this trend on various consumer behavior issues.

By means of experimentally primed bicultural children and the, use of monocultural comparison groups in the Netherlands (n=51) and Greece (n=58), it was demonstrated that social explanations, self- identification, and attitudes toward family integrity and obedience were affected by cultural identity salience. Compared to Dutch identity salience, activating Greek identity especially led to more external attributions, stronger identification with friends, a more positive evaluation of social identity, and a less positive evaluation of personal identity. Similar tendencies were found for the attitude measures. In addition, similar differences were found when comparing monocultural Dutch and monocultural Greek children. It is concluded that this kind of experimental study and its results help to improve our understanding of the experiences of bicultural individuals and the way culture influences people's lives.

Abstract = {It is currently estimated that up to 40% of Aboriginal youth (aged 13-17) will experience some form of mental health problem within their lifetime. Of greater concern is the evidence that indicates that Aboriginal youth fail to access mental health services commensurate with this need. This is due, in part, to the characteristically monocultural nature of service delivery of existing services. This paper overviews a model that has been developed specifically for the engagement of Aboriginal youth (aged 13-17 years) in mental health settings. Importantly, a mix of urban (N=43) and rural (N=68) Aboriginal youth were represented within the sample to determine its efficacy across different language and tribal groups. The model proved to be effective in engaging 97% of Aboriginal youth (n=108), with only a small number not effectively engaged (n=3). The model provides a foundation for the further development of evidence-based models of best practice that have so far provided to be elusive within this complex field.

Abstract = {Media provides a material site for girls' identity formation and presents conflicting images of femininity, which challenge young women's self-expression and physicality development. The 'problem' with girls' physicality has not been resolved, but rather complicated by discourses of new femininities in sport, fitness and health promoted by the new economies. Girls' conscious and unconscious consumption of messages of new powerful femininities might be troubling for some girls, especially 'Other' girls and/or girls 'at risk,' whose physicality collides with the emerging image of the new girls. Therefore, in this paper, I contend that an investment in the third-wave feminist agenda is still necessary to engage scholars, educators and girls in critical conversations about media, genders, the body and identity. To this end, first I discuss the feminist reappraisal of Foucault's analysis of the body as an emancipatory socio-educational and political project for (en)gendering research on the feminine 'docile body' in society. Second, I highlight emerging contemporary monocultural discourses of the 'Alpha Girl' and the 'Future Girl,' powerful sporty, fit and healthy femininities that contradict discourses of the traditional feminine docile body, and I analyze the ways these new images subsume race, class, religion and disability. Finally, I conclude this article by advocating the adoption of critical media pedagogies as a potential strategy for schooling girls' hybrid bodies.

Abstract = {Since an amendment to the Immigration Control Act in 1990, which granted 2nd and 3rd generation Japanese unlimited visa status to work in Japan, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of Brazilians of Japanese descent coming to Japan. As a result, there is a large number of couples comprising Japanese and Japanese-Brazilian in Japan. In this paper, I investigated the conditions involving Cross-Culture Kids (CCK) born of these marriages. The children’s first language is Japanese, and an overwhelming number of parents want their children to learn English as a second language rather than Portuguese. Regarding the children’s name, there were few cases in which the child used a Brazilian name. In Japanese society, which emphases uniformity and homogeneity, using a Japanese name is one method of resolving the issue of being different from others. Parents with children who are not immediately recognizable as CCKs based on characteristics of outward appearance have developed strategies for avoiding discrimination and prejudice through passing. However, passing offers little possibility of enjoying the advantages of multicultural society. CCKs with two nationalities and cultural backgrounds should be guaranteed the right to enjoy the benefit of maintaining and developing an identity as a Japanese, in addition to one more identity. W e need to encourage a new awareness of CCKs as agents for a transition from a monocultural system to a multicultural system, not only in Japanese schools, but in Japanese society as a whole.

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper seeks to report on the evaluation of Zippy’s Friends, an international emotional wellbeing programme, for primary school children in disadvantaged schools in Ireland. The paper aims to present case studies of the profile and ethos of two specific schools participating in the programme, their links with the local community, the degree of parental involvement and the factors that influence programme implementation in the local context. Design/methodology/approach: Within the framework of the overall evaluation study, which employs a randomised controlled design, two schools self-selected to participate in case studies. Employing interviews and group discussions, the case study method was used to explore the views of teachers, pupils, parents and key informants from the wider community on the delivery of the programme within the context of a whole school approach. Findings: The findings from two contrasting schools are presented, a large urban school with a multi-cultural profile in an area of multiple disadvantage, and a smaller, almost monocultural, rural school on the border region with Northern Ireland. The findings reveal largely positive attitudes on the benefits of the programme and support for a whole school approach. The data indicate contrasting levels of parental involvement in the two schools and highlight the importance of socio- economic and cultural influences in the local communities and the challenges these present for effective implementation. Research limitations/implications: The paper explores the specific contextual factors in two schools and may, therefore, lack generalisability. However, this effort to focus on the specific local context is useful within the framework of the overall randomised control trial evaluation study. Practical implications: The reality of implementing an emotional wellbeing programme in disadvantaged school settings and effectively engaging teachers, parents and the wider community, is explored through the use of case study methods. Originality/value: The paper explores the real-life context of two schools participating in the Zippy’s Friends programme and provides an insight into the contextual factors impacting on programme implementation in disadvantaged school settings.

Abstract = {Reviews the book Translating lives: Living with two languages and cultures edited by M. Besemeres, and A. Wierzbicka (2007). This book is edited by a team of mother and daughter, each contributing a chapter as well as coauthoring the introduction. In the introductory pages they allude to the gap that still exists between the reality of Australia as a multilingual, multicultural country and the ongoing dominance of a monolingual, Anglo-centric perspective both at societal and individual levels. This book is a timely addition to the literature on issues relating to cultures, languages, and identities. It consists of 12 chapters—each one devoted to an experiential account of a life in which more than one language plays a part. These succeed in covering a range of linguistic heritages including Noongar, Indo-Fijian, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, and three European languages: German, Russian, and Polish. The book can be read on a number of levels. It can sensitize the monolingual, possibly monocultural, layperson to issues that may not have occurred to him/her previously. It can reassure the bilingual or multilingual man/woman in the street, who may feel alienated living in a monolingual society, that he/she is not alone. Many critical questions are raised about the interplay of languages, world views, and a sense of self. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {An experiment was carried out to examine the effect of language accents on children's evaluations and stereotyping. 40 10-yr-old and 40 12-yr-old Australian children from monocultural and multicultural schools listened to the same passage read in English by boys with strong and mild Italo-Australian and Viet-Australian accents, and broad (i.e., strong) and general (i.e., mild) Australian accents. In addition, for half the children each accent was given its appropriate ethnic designation, whereas the remaining children listened to unlabeled accents. The children rated the accents on evaluative (status, solidarity) scales and on traits comprising the stereotype of each group. The findings indicated that their evaluations were influenced by accent ethnicity and accent strength. In addition, the older but not the younger children's evaluations were affected by accent identification and ethnic contact. The data also suggested that the accents evoked ethnic stereotypes. The emerging complexity of the language attitude-stereotype relationship is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Students participated in an hour-long, semistructured, audio-taped interview of 4 sets of open-ended questions. Experiences were analyzed, including the goals of multicultural education, the monocultural dimensions of high school curricula, and the possible impact of a multicultural curriculum and school attitudes. The discussions suggested that curriculum design should reflect contributions and perspectives of various groups to address student alienation and prejudiced, discriminatory behaviors that they encountered, and it should be inclusive of all students. Findings revealed that minority students cared very deeply about their education and validated the goals and practices advocated in multicultural education literature.

A stochastic analysis of decision making was conducted to illuminate some of the differences between group types in leader communication over time. 32 American and 10 French and Arab undergraduates were divided into 3 intercultural and 3 monocultural groups and administered, prior to and immediately following group interaction, a participant questionnaire that measured their rules governing leadership behavior. Results show that each monocultural group presented an internally consistent set of leadership rules prior to group interaction; however, each intercultural group initially presented internally varied rules. Fewer message types and interact patterns were used in the intercultural than monocultural groups. Intercultural groups also used more evaluative responses and fewer reciprocal communication behaviors. (33 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We examined the extent to which Hispanic orientation and American orientation are associated with substance use (cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana) both directly and indirectly through acculturative stress and self-esteem. Participants were 347 Hispanic early adolescents (50.7% male; mean age = 12.57, SD = 0.92, range 11–15) from two middle schools in western Michigan. Findings showed that self-esteem emerged as the most consistent predictor of likelihood and extent of substance use. Ethnic identity was positively related to risk for substance use, and acculturative stress and self-esteem mediated the relationships of Hispanic cultural orientation to alcohol use. Self-esteem was the most important protective factor against substance use, and as such, we conclude that prevention programs designed to address precocious substance use that incorporate a self-esteem building component could prove useful among Hispanic early adolescents residing in monocultural contexts within the United States.

This is a highly enjoyable collection of personal narratives by 12 Australians who share glimpses of their journeys in being and becoming linguistic and cultural boundary crossers. It is the first book of its kind to deal with the Australian context, and it is meant to provide monocultural and monolingual Australians with a sense of living with and between two or more languages. This book is meant to expand the worldview of such Australians who operate exclusively in English through learning about the experiences of bilinguals living in Australia. There are two strong threads that tie the narratives together which make this collection an important contribution for the interrelated fields of bilingualism, biculturalism, identity studies, and global migration. The first thread is the development of intercultural awareness as a result of living with two languages and two or more cultural scripts. The second, perhaps less prominent, thread is some authors’ recognition of cultural changes in the linguistic and cultural scripts of their first languages in their countries of origin or in heritage-language speaking communities in Australia.

Fifteen preservice teachers completed pre- and posttest measures related to hope, motivation for teaching, and efficacy for teaching. Throughout the semester, they were required to investigate personal beliefs and past experiences with cultural diversity in the form of writing reflective response letters and cultural autobiographies. Providing the students with these opportunities was beneficial; however, findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest that (a) multiple opportunities across time are needed to uncover and dialogue about beliefs to present significant change rather than single, isolated opportunities and (b) teacher candidates with multicultural schooling and life experiences are more likely to have favorable beliefs and attitudes regarding cultural diversity than are candidates with monocultural schooling and life experiences.

Design/methodology/approach: The study elaborates on the framework of Milliken and Martins, further examining the effects of both average age and age differences. The authors collected objective data as well as data through questionnaires among 150 work teams with more than 1,500 white-collar and blue-collar workers from an automotive company in Sweden. With these data the authors conducted correlation and step-by-step hierarchical regression analyses. Findings: The analyses showed significant positive effects of average age on both short-term and long-term consequences. No significant effects of age differences were found. Research limitations/implications: Conducting a longitudinal study in an automotive company in Sweden resulted in monocultural findings. The use of a sample from one organization may limit the generalization of our findings. Future research should pay more attention to effects of age in teams, compared to individual age effects in organizations and to explore more advanced models that help to understand the dynamic processes of age in teams. Practical implications: The results have implications for management of teams and HRM policy in organizations relating to recruitment, early retirement, training developments and team composition in general.

The aim is (a) to provide a brief review of two influential areas of multilevel organizational research, namely climate and leadership and (b) to broaden the perspective of published multilevel research of organizations by including national culture as an additional level of study. Using guidelines for developing multilevel theories and research in monocultural settings (Chen, Mathieu, & Bliese, 2004; Hofmann & Jones, 2004; Klein & Kozlowski, 2000b; Kozlowski & Klein, 2000), guidelines for multilevel theories and studies incorporating national culture are presented.

Abstract = {This study examined acculturative stress and self-esteem as mediators of the association of ethnic identity and acculturation with psychosocial outcomes. The study sample consisted of 347 Hispanic adolescents in a "new" immigrant-receiving community in the Midwest. The authors expected acculturation to influence psychosocial adjustment through acculturative stress and ethnic identity to influence psychosocial adjustment through self-esteem. Results indicated that relationships of ethnic identity to academic grades and to externalizing symptoms were mediated by self-esteem and that both U.S. and Hispanic acculturation orientations were directly associated with prosocial behavior. The relationships of U.S. cultural orientation to academic grades and to behavior problems were mediated through acculturative stress and self-esteem. Implications of these findings for the study of Hispanics in more monocultural receiving communities are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {To improve the quality in teaching and learning, opportunities need to be provided where practitioners and researchers meet and share visions, disseminate findings, co-construct ideas, and set research agendas together. Visiting a conference is one well-known and established way to do this. But are they effective? A survey was conducted among the attendants of 15 practice-oriented and research-oriented conferences (N = 490) with monocultural and mixed audiences held in The Netherlands in 2005. The findings suggest that, although conferences provide formal and informal opportunities for interdisciplinary dialogues, intradisciplinary meetings are prominent. Most encounters are aimed at the dissemination of information. To a lesser extent, people exchange materials, co-create knowledge, and set research agendas. The conferences sustain traditional role divisions in which researchers present and practitioners consume. To improve the interactivity between researchers and practitioners at conferences, new web-based interaction formats are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The author examines the modes by which a generation of scholars has established race and sexuality as mutually constitutive. Interrogating the work of the axiomatic in confining such epistemological interventions in queer studies to the dead category of "self-evident truths," the author insists that "intersections" be rigorously historicized rather than merely asserted as structural. This process involves fracturing dominant narratives of both sexual and racial formation, as well as their imbrications, to expose forgotten or incomplete sites of mutual construction. The author's project is to reanimate intersectionality, both refusing it as an already constituted category and refusing to abandon it. The study of racialized sexualities, in this framing, revises Foucauldian histories of sexuality and reworks the relationships between sexuality and epistemology and between sexuality and power. In entwined genealogies of the intersectional analyses that have historicized racial formations and monocultural Foucauldian histories of sexuality, the author forcefully elaborates the ways in which race rewrites the history (and present future) of sexuality studies.

The expansion of global capitalism has changed the very structure and scope of many organizations, transforming them from local to transnational, monocultural to multicultural. In addition to the changing economic landscape, globalization has effected profound shifts in the way that culture is imagined, transmitted, and consumed within the global landscape. As the contributors to this fine volume have demonstrated, the ability to recognize and respond to this new cultural milieu stands as one of the primary challenges of organizational leaders. To respond to these conditions in ways that yield more safe, humane, and productive organizations, several challenges lay before us. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The labor market in Sweden today does not offer a rosy picture for young people. Among them are youth with a migrant background that have the lowest chance of becoming employed. In principle migrant background should work in favor of young people. After all, even if they are born in the country their parents migrated to, they have knowledge of at least two cultures and two languages, and are thus more flexible than monocultural people. However, instead of being credited with specific capabilities, young people of a migrant background are seen as deficient. It is a battlefield with its contradictory value systems, its unpredictable requirements and its poor possibilities for young people's employment, which the young person with a migrant background enters in order to make her/his way into Swedish society. How young people see their future, the ways in which they make sense of and deal with the possibilities and constraints they encounter, decides "in the last instance" what kind of life they will lead. As opposed to an individual heroism, many young migrants interviewed showed an unusual commitment to social issues. This was unusual in so far as it distinguished them from young people without an experience of migration. This was different for many young people with a migrant background who often envisaged making a difference also for others. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This chapter describes The Critical Moments Project from its origins in the Goodrich Scholarship Program at the University of Nebraska at Omaha to its evolution as a campus equity and engagement initiative in Washington State. Drawing on students' accounts of personal experiences in higher education, Critical Moments identifies those patterns of inequity, often buried in the details of ordinary campus life, that need to be uncovered and challenged if students of color, in particular, are to feel at home in higher education. Students are interviewed; their experiences are written as case stories; these stories, in turn, become starting points for discussions in classrooms and other campus settings. The Critical Moments Project weaves together successful educational practices--problem-posing education, case teaching methodology, conceptual frameworks from ethnic studies, and learning in the context of diverse communities. The project privileges underrepresented students' voices: First, to make public their experiences in higher education; second, to interrogate collectively the sources of oppression embedded in these experiences; and third, to transform a monocultural academy into one where every student's cultural identity is welcomed and honored. Throughout the project, critical thinking--the ability to analyze personal experience through critical, social analyses--becomes the means for transforming institutional policies and practices.

Abstract = {The present study compares adolescents' contribution to mealtime conversations in U.S. American, Estonian, Swedish Estonian and Swedish middle-class families. To that end, mealtime interactions at homes were videotaped and later analyzed in respect to talkativeness and conversational intents (to control the conversational partner's behavior or to elicit his/her talk). Similarly to their mothers, the American and Swedish teenagers were found to talk more than the Estonian teenagers. Furthermore, the Swedish teenagers differed from other teenagers by the use of biggest amount of behavioral directives addressed toward their mothers. Conversation-eliciting style was typical of American teens and their mothers, whereas the directive conversational style was characteristic only of the monocultural Estonian mothers. Our results support the notion that ways of using language during family conversations are culture-specific, and teenagers from different sociocultural backgrounds differ in respect of how active participants in family conversations they are. Our findings indicated more symmetrical communication in the U.S. American and Swedish monolingual families than, for example, in Estonian monolingual families. These results appear to reflect differences in child rearing styles. Finally, possible reasons for cultural variations in family socialization patterns (differences in child-rearing values and goals, different practices and meanings of talking, strict control, etc.) and some of their consequences, will be discussed.

Abstract = {Each cultural context imposes a different meaning on peace and conflict. Strategic thinking about conflict resulting from terrorism must accommodate the many different culturally learned interpretations of each cultural context to achieve peace. Any adequate interpretation of peace and war must be multicultural in accommodating the many cultures involved (Pedersen, 2001). The simplistic monocultural alternative of "declaring victory and returning home" has not worked and has led to escalating world conflicts (Manwaring & Joes, 2000). This chapter will address three themes originally identified by Fry and Bjorkqvist (1997). The first theme is that there are alternatives to violence, which challenges the prevailing belief in Western cultures that aggression and warfare are inevitable consequences of conflict. Culture-bound Westernized assumptions will be challenged and alternative perspectives will be suggested. The second theme is the importance of culture in shaping how people perceive, evaluate, and act out options when dealing with conflict. Different cultures have developed their own formal and informal ways of handling conflict. The third theme is to enhance the repertoire of alternatives to violence and present a generalized framework for managing conflict in its cultural context. The importance of patterns in the cultural construction of conflict and peace will be highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

In Study 4, when Asian Canadians made choices for a friend, an independent self-affirmation reduced dissonance for bicultural Asian Canadians but not for monocultural Asian Canadians.

Abstract = {Vocabulary acquisition is a critical component of academic language. This aspect of the school curriculum seems to be more difficult for language learners to acquire. This study therefore examines the language arts conceptual framework and the instructional activities for vocabulary development in a second grade mixed classroom with a view to evaluate how language learning conceptualization and instructional practices accommodate specific well-established theoretical, practical and pedagogical issues underpinning English language teaching/learning. Drawing on insights from the theories of the sociocultural approach and critical language pedagogy, I reviewed the Reading/Language Arts Framework for its provisions for language learners. In addition, I observed a vocabulary lesson in a second grade class. The study reveals that the conceptual framework sets the stage for vocabulary instruction to foster monolingual and monocultural American society despite the fact that second grade classrooms in Los Angeles metropolitan city contain learners of dynamic and sometimes conflicting identities, needs, preferences, interests and aspiration. Furthermore, the study shows that the tight control of the teacher on instructional activities and the structured nature of the lesson did not create a conducive atmosphere for language learners to appropriate other pupils' voices and identities.

Iam most grateful to Lynne Layton for her thoughtful and learned discussion of "Between Arrogance and a Dead End." In that article I examined the pitfalls, respectively, of the right and the left in postmodern politics. Here, in my response to Layton's discussion, I try to sketch out and illustrate through clinical examples how, from the beginning, we might think differently about psychotherapy in order to avoid the excesses of both the right's monocultural arrogance and the left's moral relativism. Layton focuses mainly on the first error, which I appreciate. My overall point, however, is that the two errors can be effectively avoided only by attending to both at once, because ultimately they are expressions of the same philosophical problem and must be addressed in the same way: by a wholehearted embrace of a more fully thought out hermeneutic vision. In her discussion Layton searches for ways of integrating into therapeutic practice realizations about how the larger institutions, arrangements, and ideologies of our social world shape psychological experience. That is a goal of mine as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The interpretive turn in the human sciences has profoundly influenced interpersonal, postmodern, and now relational psychoanalysis. Although it has transformed psychotherapy theory in many ways, some important philosophical difficulties have also followed in its wake. In this paper I examine two founders of the interpretive turn, the hermeneuticist Martin Heidegger and the postmodernist Michel Foucault. Practitioners of both theories feature an understanding of human being that is historical or cultural, and yet, admirably, attempt to avoid historical determinism. Some hermeneuticists do so by emphasizing how historical traditions intersect and then affect one another; some postmodernists do so by emphasizing the experiential and heuristic importance of the sociopolitical periphery. I examine these two strategies and their implications for psychotherapy by critiquing Heidegger's involvement in National Socialism and Foucault's limited vision of the moral: Heidegger's monocultural arrogance and Foucault's extreme relativism. I argue that both positions are deficient, and suggest that Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutic concept of dialogue (enhanced with some of Antonio Gramsci's socialism) can remedy both flaws and point the way toward more helpful psychotherapeutic applications of the interpretive turn.

Abstract = {The chapters that compose Volume One of the Handbook collectively represent the work of psychologists and social scientists who have struggled to transform psychology from a monocultural White American scientific and applied discipline to a profession that includes multiple racial-cultural perspectives and worldviews. Although the hegemony of Western psychological concepts persists within the larger field of psychology, the theoretical developments and bodies of research reviewed in this volume provide confirmation that change is needed. It is apparent that the racial and cultural revolution in psychology has a long way to go. We believe that this is because it is difficult to consider the reality of people whose socialization and experience are different from one's own. From the perspective of oneself or one's own racial-cultural group it can seem axiomatic and self-evident that the filter one used to view one's experience and environment is shared by all of humanity. Cultural difference, when it has been addressed by the social sciences, has primarily focused on variations in dress and other physical manifestations of explicit customs that are readily apparent. It has been more difficult to discern the aspects of culture that are less visible, such as communication styles, thought patterns, and feelings. Therefore, we commend the tremendous effort of the contributing authors who have taken on the challenge of elucidating these veiled and unspoken aspects of race and culture.

Abstract = {Biculturally competent individuals may adopt flexible forms of emotional expression that help them address not only acculturation stress but also the forms of distress that affect bicultural and monocultural individuals alike. In a sample of 174 bicultural undergraduates, level of bicultural competence moderated the effects of an "existential" aspect of depression (i.e., the sense of a foreshortened future) in predicting both expressive flexibility during wakefulness and emotional flux within the content of impactful dreams. Among individuals high in bicultural competence, those who sensed a foreshortened future following loss or trauma were more likely to report: (1) feeling exploration through direct self-reflection; (2) feeling exploration through aesthetic response; and (3) spontaneous emotional flux within impactful dreams. These findings suggest that expressive flexibility among biculturally competent individuals becomes evident in their manner of identifying, understanding, and expressing emotions during a stressful life event.

These essays recognize that social relational systems can contain different cultural goals for close relationships and trust. Different social networks provide functionally and relationally different experiences for children as they develop. Lewis emphasizes that the influences of these relationally rich and complex networks can have direct or indirect effects of several kinds. The cultural meaning of relationships affects attachment because cultural communities are interested in socializing children for appropriate trust in particular local cultural and social contexts. Takahashi's Affective Relationship Model illustrates this through the finding that a different pattern of affective relations and different types of preferences are found across contexts and across the life span. The social-relational models in these articles challenge the dyadic attachment theory and offer new methods for the study of emotionally close relations across the life span. They challenge the monocultural assumptions of good development that are also part of classical attachment paradigms, and open up to our view the plural pathways cultural communities provide for the socialization of trust in children.

Abstract = {The goal of this chapter is to illustrate the efforts of one academic department to change from an ethnocentric to a multicultural organization. The authors describe an evolution of organizational diversity and individual experiences in a department of counseling, which is home to a master of arts in counseling and a PhD in counseling psychology, and is staffed by six full-time faculty and two part-time faculty. In the author's department's effort to evolve to an environment where diversity is the norm, they have chosen to explore how multicultural competency impacts their work as a group, as well as their work as individuals. The changes they have made over the last decade reflect the developmental stages of organizational multicultural development described by D. W.

Abstract = {Investigated 2 hypotheses regarding monocultural bilingual children: that they show relatively more problem behaviors than monoglots and to that extent are maladjusted; and that the degree of maladjustment is related to their 2nd-language attainment. The sample was comprised of 226 6-10 yr. olds, with Kannada or Telugu as their mother-tongue, drawn from the 1st 5 classes of 30 primary Tamil-medium schools of Madras. Relevant information about the Ss was sought from the teachers through an  inventory covering school situations and from the parents through another inventory covering home situations. For the 1st hypothesis, a control group of children with Tamil as their mother-tongue, matched for intelligence, was used. The 2nd-language attainment of the sample was judged by measuring 4 language skills. Results support the 1st hypothesis partially, but not the 2nd.

Abstract = {Presents a technique that extracts individual models of social behavior. Such models reflect each individual's ideas about what social behaviors are interrelated, and what aspects of social situations are linked to different levels of probability that particular patterns of social behavior will occur. The method was used in 2 studies, one with bicultural Ss (1 American, 6 Latin Americans, 2 Hong Kong Chinese, and 1 Greek) and the other with 22 monocultural Mexican and Chinese Ss and 8 of the bilinguals from the 1st study. For each S, factor analysis of the judgments concerning the probability of occurrence of specific social behaviors in specific social situations provided information of how the S linked social behaviors. ANOVA on the factor scores provided information about the S's beliefs concerning how attributes of social situations are linked to social behaviors. Inspection of the individual models of social behavior indicated that some common elements across models are probably linked to culture. The technique has wide applicability for social and personality psychology because it permits idiographic comparison of models of social behavior across individuals who share some attribute.

Abstract = {Recent studies of racioethnic differences in job satisfaction have yielded inconsistent results. It is posited that the physical variable race/national origin (synonymous with physioethnicity), that is commonly used to operationalize race/ethnicity, is not sufficiently comprehensive to detect the social and cultural essence of racioethnicity. Thus, this article offers "so do ethnicity" as a less observable type of racioethnicity. This delineation of socioethnicity enables the researchers and practitioners to measure the number of cultures with which an individual identifies. Based on previous research findings and grounded in orthogonal cultural identification theory, it is hypothesized that multicultural members of the majority group in a racioethnically diverse work environment will be more satisfied with their coworkers than monocultural members. Results supported the hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Students have travelled from one country to another for centuries, particularly in Europe. They have often faced problems: an early study in America, published in 1925, listed difficulties for foreign students over academic issues, language, housing, economic issues, their inability to become socially accepted, health and recreation, and racial prejudice. But it was not until comparatively recently that the foreign student experience became the focus of psychological study. In many cases foreign students do appear to experience more physical and mental ill health than native students, as well as more academic problems. Although there are no grand theories attempting to explain this phenomenon, various concepts have been put forward to predict the quality, quantity and chronicity of sojourner distress. One such concept is the culture-distance concept, which states simply that the absolute amount of difference or distance (defined both objectively and subjectively) between a sojourner's own and the host culture is directly proportionally related to the amount of stress or difficulty experienced. Various friendship networks (monocultural, bicultural, multicultural) serve important psychological functions, which in turn help a sojourner over numerous difficulties.

Biracial girls face all the developmental challenges of growing up female and the additional challenge of forging an identity in a society that presses them to choose a monocultural existence and disavow part of their ethnic heritage. Existing literature raises several potential issues for biracial girls in terms of identity development, social and sexual relationships, and family. Therapist ethnic awareness, client physical appearance, reasons for seeking treatment, level of identity development, and environmental considerations are discussed. Therapists are encouraged to offer a sociopolitical perspective, promote biracial/bicultural identity development, assist biracial girls in connecting with a multicultural community, and work collaboratively with parents in fostering the positive development of biracial girls.

Abstract = {Examined maternal control of children across families with early adolescents from different sociocultural backgrounds. The intention was to find out whether belonging to the same ethnic group/language community is more important for determination of childrearing attitudes and practices than sharing the immediate sociocultural context. In addition, attention was paid to the relationship between attitudes and behaviour. The results were obtained from three monocultural samples of Estonian, Swedish, and Finnish families living in their country of origin; two bicultural samples consisted of Estonian and Finnish families residing in Sweden. Two types of data--mothers' reported attitudes towards the importance of control over children's behaviour and video-recorded real-life verbal behaviour were used to determine how the mothers' attitudes towards control relate to the behavioural control exhibited in their real-life interactions. The study showed that the Finno-Ugric mothers living in their countries of origin controlled their children's behaviour significantly more frequently than those Finno-Ugric mothers who live in Sweden, but both Estonian samples outperformed Finns in their reported control attitudes...

Abstract = {"Culture' used to be thought of as a whole, internally consistent system of symbols and values held in common by members of bounded social groups, including whole societies. That view is changing among anthropologists currently. This article traces the intellectual history of those changes, across the earlier perspectives of functionalism and conflict theory, through recent perspectives on culture as residing in the practices of local communities of practice. Both those local social groups and the persons within them are presumed currently to be multicultural rather than monocultural. Implications of this for the study of human development are that (1) acquisition of culture involves apprentice-like interaction in specific communities of practice, and that (2) a key unit of analysis in the study of the acquisition of culture is the indiviudal's encounters with various specific communities of practice in that individual's distinctive daily round. Patterns of culture in whole societies in relation to those in local communities of practice are currently undertheorized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Notes that despite the fundamental importance of multicultural group work activities in the curriculum, previous literature has shown that home and international students do not spontaneously mix and would rather be involved in monocultural work groups. It is maintained that one of the major causes for this lies in the home students' belief that assessed multicultural group work has a detrimental effect on their individual average mark. Using data from a large cohort (304 Ss) enrolled on a 1st-yr business studies program of a UK university, this study employs regression analysis to empirically investigate the extent to which this belief is supported by the data. The results suggest that the performance of culturally mixed groups is neither a function of the individual ability of the least able group member, nor of the average ability of the members of the group. Instead, in this context, the group work mark is more likely to reflect the ability of the most able group member. The data also indicate that assessed multicultural group work has, on average, a positive rather than negative effect on the individual average mark of all students, evidence consistent with the synergistic effects expected to emerge in multicultural groups (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Yet, the theories of health care, the standards used to judge healthy and unhealthy behavior, and the actual delivery of services are culture-bound and reflect a monocultural perspective of the health care professions.

The authors first examine the theoretical assumptions and methodological fallacies that underlie the assumed universal patterns of expression of mental distress rather than cultural specificity of idioms of distress.

They offer a different theoretical perspective for assessing the mental health of Asian American clients, and broadening the monocultural, European American paradigm to promote greater sensitivity in the assessment of cultural variations in emotional distress. It is suggested that researchers and practitioners interpret behavior according to its contextual meaning and accept the equal validity of various cultural constructions of the distress.

This suggests that the wider the range of strategies an individual has to cope with cultural diversity, the better he/she will be able to effectively manage a culturally diverse or monocultural environment. The authors make suggestions for future research and implications for counseling are suggested. Examples of items from the questionnaire used in this study are appended.

Some of these reminders have been quite pleasant and validating; many, however, serve to invalidate, diminish, and strike at the core of my racial identity. As a person of color, I have been exposed to prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Surviving monoculturalism and racism has helped shape not only my personal identity but my professional one as well. In this chapter, I would like to share with you some of the lessons I have learned about prejudice and discrimination, especially as it relates to growing up culturally different in a predominantly monocultural society.

Abstract = {Focuses on crucial problems of race and ethnicity at the level of higher education in South Africa. The authors discuss the roles of institutions of higher education in transforming a post-apartheid South Africa. The major challenge facing higher education is to provide equitable access to its institutions for members of all groups and to integrate diverse ethnic and racial groups into historically segregated, monocultural institutions. The authors suggest that transforming higher education in South Africa is a monumental task. They address problems that constrain the transformation and reform initiatives based on reform reports, including the Education White Paper issued in 1997 by the Department of Education, which presents a national framework for transforming higher education. The authors observe that there are parallels between the current demands in South Africa for integration of higher education and those in the US during the civil rights movement and subsequent 2 decades.

Abstract = {Conquest, land-theft, slavery, and genocide do not fit easily into heroic narratives of national destiny. When these brutalities are not publicly named and mourned, a habit of dissociative thinking is hardened into a cultural complex. The instinct of depth psychology is to approach these matters by climbing up to the peaks of a universalist discourse. This instinct is as much a social as a personal therapy. A public restoration process will require much more mature, self-conscious, and sophisticated individuals for the dialogue of the future among communities. Those who are inexperienced in negotiating multiple cultural codes because they live in monocultural environments will need to learn the arts of mestizaje and conversation in uncomfortable borderlands. Many people will be needed to create together the new decentered environments where all can reclaim desire, meaning, magic, and possibility. If it enters the vale, depth psychology has an important contribution to make in remapping of discontinuous and multiple notions of self and other, consciousness and unconscious, that must be the basis of restorative encounters and acts of love.

Abstract = {Research on multicultural groups has typically extended monocultural group research rather than building on prior cross-cultural research. This article brings together the literature on cross-cultural and multicultural groups to look at the experience of Russian-American collaboration. In this exploratory study, American (n = 17) and Russian (n = 18) informants described their experiences in on-going, business-related small groups. Qualitative and descriptive analysis suggested that cultural differences did impede collaboration, although mutual benefits to heterogeneous groups were also identified, The strongest cultural factor appeared to be the influence of external stakeholders on the group. These findings suggest that future research on multicultural groups needs to use a more complex approach to combine the findings of several bodies of literature.

Abstract = {This article explores the moral sources that give multiculturalism the potency to move psychology to reassess itself. The power of the multicultural perspective appears to derive from its ability to show how psychology's tendency toward monocultural universalism has undermined its aims as a science of human behavior and promoter of human welfare. The multicultural critique also draws on Euro-American moral traditions and ideals, such as individual rights, authenticity, respect, and tolerance. In spite of the importance of these ideals, multiculturalists often criticize Euro-American culture without acknowledging their debt to it. Moreover, these particularist moral sources undercut multiculturalism's universalist appeal. There is a paradoxical tendency among some advocates of multiculturalism to encourage cultural separatism and an inarticulateness in dealing with intercultural value conflict. We present some recommendations for dealing with these dilemmas from philosophical hermeneutics, including the contextualization of multiculturalism, an approach to sifting and evaluating cultural values, and an ontological account of the dialogical nature of humans.

Abstract = {This chapter demonstrates that the evidence for gender differences in verbal, mathematical, and visual-spatial ability stems from studies of European American, middle- class samples who have average levels of cognitive functioning. When other ethnic groups are included in such analyses and a wider range of skills is assessed, these differences are challenged and often reversed. Importantly, data on people of color render biological explanations for cognitive gender differences suspicious at best. For example, if (purported) male superiority in mathematics is the product of male biology, Halpern asks, then why are the men in question overwhelmingly Asian rather than Black or Latino? Unless one wishes to suggest that Black and Latino men are less biologically male than Asian men, achievement in mathematics by women or men--seems to be a question of reinforcement and opportunity within specific sociocultural contexts rather than an issue of biology. Halpern reveals how the sociocultural context of middle-class European Americans has produced ostensible cognitive gender differences and highlights the dangers of using monocultural samples who represent the middle range of skills, income, and the like, in gender research.

Abstract = {Originally published in Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books, 1995, Vol 40(11), 1088-1089. This is a review of the book, "Catecholamine Function in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Emerging Concepts" (see record [rid]1994-97404-000[/rid]). This book, edited and largely contributed to by M. Michele Murburg, is an examination of the state of research into a narrow slice of a somewhat broader slice of the PTSD pie, an examination admittedly limited and incomplete. Various authors describe the basic foundations of stress responses as understood through the neurobiology of the catecholaminergic system and then summarize research into that area. The initial presentation is a section oriented toward an overview of catecholaminergic responses to stress and the neurobiological systems involved. Chapters then focus more precisely on PTSD and such systems. Methodological issues are then presented, which help define the boundary lines of both what has been done and the possible limits on generalizing results thus far gathered. An excellent summary of the book, pointing out still unresolved issues and conflicts among the authors is provided. The book's strength lies in its ability to clearly provide an overview of the research into the functions of catecholaminergic systems in PTSD. What is lacking is, oddly enough, a psychiatric perspective. But perhaps the greatest problem with the book is its monocultural fixation on catecholamines. At best, this book will serve as a historical artifact as to what was being explored among some researchers at this time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reviews the book Pastoral Leadership for Manhood and Womanhood by W. Grudem and D. Rainey (2004). The authors believe that the moral drift and decay prevalent in America today can be changed by strengthening the smallest societal unit, the family. Further, they believe the pastor's personal life and family should reflect and demonstrate health and spiritual integrity. This unit, the pastoral family, must then strengthen and bring health to the next unit of society, the church, and from there, influence local communities. Strengths of this book include the scholarship and experience of outstanding practitioners-authors. These men are not just theorists. The resulting work is very practical and thoroughly Biblical. The authors are consistent in espousing their complementarian view of marriage issues. Weaknesses of the book are the failure to allow for other views of marital roles (do the authors believe that egalitarian views of marriage are wrong?). Another unease I felt was that the male voice is dominant throughout the book (are there no women able to speak on these issues?). Still another concern was the monocultural stance as if there are no other Christian populations in the world, and no other cultures represented in the North American church.

Moghaddam, Donald M. Taylor, and Stephen C. Wright (1993). The major aim of this nicely crafted book is to provide a culturally sensitive supplement to the mainly monocultural texts used in introductory courses in social psychology and related disciplines (e.g., organizational behavior). Throughout the book, the main ideas are always explained effectively and efficiently with interesting examples, and succinct, understandable summaries of research findings. The book's main weakness may very well lie in its brevity. Although coverage of issues is not exhaustive, the authors have chosen topics carefully and wisely. Overall, the authors make a convincing case for the importance of the study of culture in any comprehensive analysis of our social life.

(see record [rid]1992-97305-000[/rid]). In this edited volume, Root presents a new paradigm for the emerging multiracial population in America. The call for deconstruction of existing theory and the creation of new paradigms for understanding and investigating the multicultural experience is a major premise of this book. Existing social, political, and theoretical frameworks--based on monocultural, monoracial, linear models of social relations and social identity--have forced biracial individuals to choose one or the other culture and to deny significant parts of their heritage and existence. These models mirror the dichotomous, forced choice schemes of racial classification. This volume seeks to correct these practices and perceptions by presenting alternative approaches to social identity and racial classification based on the incorporation of simultaneous membership and multiple, fluid identities.

Abstract = {This latest edition (see record [rid]2002-06787-000[/rid]) offers a contemporary expansion of the definition of multicultural counseling that pushes the boundaries of the field and allows for a more inclusive and meaningful way of looking at and treating diverse populations. The authors have updated the book to include new developments in research, theory, and practice. Major additions include: a more expansive definition of multiculturalism; the most recent statistics on the changing complexion of society; and implications for counseling and clinical practice that these changes have precipitated, which are forcing clinicians to redefine their roles and reeducate themselves on how to tend to these varied populations. The book includes new chapters on counseling biracial/multiracial populations, women, gays/lesbians, the physically challenged, the elderly, and monocultural organizations; a new section in every chapter covering implications for clinical practice; updated chapters on counseling African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. The reviewer concludes that the book combines a sound conceptual framework for multicultural counseling with proven therapeutic methods for specific populations.
