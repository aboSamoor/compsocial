The researcher will examine how radio producers in a multi-ethnic and multilingual context draw on, mediate, and transform the ideological marking of different language varieties. The research will be conducted in Montréal, Canada, where the researcher will focus on the particular case of the development of Haitian identity. While situated within the larger socio-historical context of Québec's official cultural and language policies, aimed at forging a distinct society through the promotion of the French language, the researcher will pay particular attention to the choices and influence of the people who are most directly affected and targeted by these policies. <br/><br/>The investigator will combine participant observation, semi-directed interviews, social network analysis, textual analysis of radio documents, and conversation, discourse and phonetic analyses of on- and off-air language practices. The data gathered through these methods will be used to answer the following questions: 1) Who is involved in Haitian radio production in Montréal and what are their everyday work and linguistic practices that contribute to generating audience-appropriate programming and representing an image of a plural Québec within Haitian radio? 2) How are decisions to broadcast in a language or a variety of language arrived at, implemented and justified at the organizational level and what are the consequences of on-air language choice on the daily operations of these radio stations? And 3) What are the language ideologies undergirding and shaping French and Kreyòl language choice and language policy at each radio station both on- and off-air, and how are they made evident through language practices? <br/><br/>By attending to the ways Haitian radio producers negotiate their insertion into Québec's cultural landscape through their on-air language choices, this research adds to the theorization of radio, a widespread yet understudied medium. While much work has been done on the ways communities make use of visual media to represent and define themselves, this research will contribute to an understanding of the different ways a community get represented through its voices. The project also contributes to the education and training of a social scientist."

The project examines the way early colonial Spanish households functioned, focusing particularly on how colonists incorporated indigenous Pueblo peoples into household activities, and how they made a living in the Southwest's challenging environment. Spanish colonizers introduced new plants, animals, and agricultural practices into this region, and these and later introductions have had a dramatic effect on the Southwest's landscape. We know little about Spanish household activities during this period or their impacts on the environment. Because all written records held within the colony were destroyed during the Pueblo Rebellion in the late 17th century, archaeology is the primary way that the foundations of Hispanic society in the American Southwest can be understood. The results of this investigation are relevant beyond the region as the Spanish colonization of New Mexico provides a case study for examining the development of relationships between colonizers and indigenous peoples. The research contributes to an understanding of power differentials, cultural pluralism, and the interplay between culture and the environment. <br/><br/>The majority of 17th-century Spanish colonizers lived in rural ranches, making the activities at these locations particularly important. Previous studies of the region's colonization have focused on Pueblo peoples' reactions to this colonization. Thus, Spanish households are an important but underutilized source of information about colonization processes. The research focuses on several questions. What were the colonists' economic strategies? How did they incorporate native peoples' practices and knowledge into these activities? What were the colonists' relationships to the environment? The researchers explore these issues by conducting archaeological excavations and obtaining environmental samples from one of the most important early colonial Spanish sites in New Mexico. The types and distribution of artifacts, such as ceramics, will be used to explore the identity of the people contributing to the household and the types of activities that they engaged. With biological data, such as pollen, researchers will investigate the relationships colonizers had with the environment, focusing particularly on changes resulting from the introduction of plow agriculture and grazing livestock on this marginal environment. The project will provide for the training of graduate students in all aspects of the research. The researchers have developed a partnership with El Rancho de las Golondrinas, a living history museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico that is dedicated to Hispanic history and culture. Information developed through the project will be made available to the general public in the form of exhibits, lectures, and docent training at the museum."

Head Start, a federal pre-school program for poor families that has gained wide public acceptance, gives parents--generally poor women--substantial legal power to make management decisions at the local level. Head Start's client governance component has endured for over a quarter century and remains strong. As such, the program provides a rich store of empirical data on issues of institutional design and cultural pluralism that are both timely and poorly understood. Through demographic and archival research, open-ended interviews with parents and staff, participant observation, and conversational analysis of parent deliberations, the study will provide a detailed, comparative account of the interplay between legal framework and local culture in Head Start's client governance process. Two broad themes, power and community, will structure the data collection and guide the data analysis over a one-year period in two field sites. Parent participation provides an opportunity to explore problems of democratic control over bureaucracies. This research will address theoretical and policy-oriented issues relating to the law's capacity to facilitate greater participation by ethnically and economically subordinated groups in the social institutions of the welfare state. The study will inform our understanding of how parent governance is being enacted, how the formal structure of the law is guiding that enactment, and how that enactment distributes power and facilitates community at the local level. As such, it will illuminate the complex processes of citizen governance and will suggest how the law might more effectively enable the well- being of women and their families within those communities. Also, the research will provide a basis for more generally assessing the potential and limits of parent governance reforms in education."

The Green Revolution was not the first attempt by the United States to further its global ambitions through the extension of state agricultural expertise, however, nor was it the inevitable outcome of scientific attention to agricultural production in the 1930s and 1940s. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the notion that the New Deal era, marked by the U.S. Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, was the start of a radically different mode of transnational agrarian planning, a mode that was actively exported through the Americas during the Second World War. These U.S.-sponsored development programs were rooted in notions of collectivist conservationism, cultural pluralism, and democratic resource management. The result of scientific experiments by teams of U.S. Department of the Interior anthropologists, sociologists, and soil scientists working to combat erosion on U.S. Indian tribal lands, the New Deal-era land management models addressed both cultural and biological processes at work in diverse environmental and political contexts. The doctoral student performing this research will conduct a comparative examination of three local manifestations of this program, drawing on government and foundation records as well as scientific publications, records of congressional hearings, and personal papers in order to understand how New Deal soil management strategies were translated and transformed across the heterogeneous political landscapes of the Americas. She will consider contested de-stocking programs on the tribal lands of the Navajo Nation in the U.S., and she will examine U.S.-sponsored agrarian development under shifting property relations in Colombia's Cauca Valley as well as scientific research and development in the indigenous ejidos of Michoacán, Mexico, two national contexts that were also pilot sites of the Rockefeller Foundation's Green Revolution. Taking into consideration the complex networks of intellectual, political, and economic interests supporting transnational New Deal-era conservation efforts, this project will explore the ways that emerging scientific notions of human and non-human natures were deployed in response to race-based land claims, considering both the successes and failures of these projects in meeting their stated social, political, and ecological goals.<br/><br/>This project will shed new light on an aspect of environmental, political, and intellectual history that has received relatively little attention, and it will develop key theoretical connections between science and technology studies and human geography. The implications of this research for present understanding are expected to be significant. First, as a period confronted simultaneously by world-scale financial, military, and ecological crises, the New Deal era offers important lessons to citizens and policy makers seeking to navigate the challenges of current global conjuncture. Furthermore, this project will reveal critical structural and genealogical aspects of current development strategies, suggesting new possibilities for constructive, collaborative social change. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."
