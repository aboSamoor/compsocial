Ongoing political debate over the issue was only exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 because major immigrant flows to Western Europe are from Muslim countries. In this context, the Netherlands is the only Western European nation to commit itself to the ideal of constructing a ""multicultural state."" The Dutch state sees this policy ideal as crucial because it will maintain the coherence of the increasingly multi-ethnic country, alleviate growing fear and suspicion of immigrants among sections of the population, and overcome growing ethnic segregation in the big cities. But while this is the policy ideal, a massive political shift has occurred in favor of anti-immigrant parties, and increasing segregation occurs in the big cities. Current academic analysis lacks a grounded empirical focus on the relationships between multicultural policy ideals and their implementation and negotiation in urban space. This doctoral dissertation research project explores this connection in four neighborhoods in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The project asks the following questions: What constitutes policies aimed at integration and multiculturalism? What are their roots in different cycles of migration? Who defines these policies? How is the implementation of policy negotiated geographically? How do they affect socio-spatial interaction in urban space? To answer these questions, the investigator will draw on a variety of methods, including the collection and analysis of census data, an extensive archival study of policy documents, semi-structured interviews with key actors involved in multicultural policy development and implementation, and semi-structured interviews and participant observation in four comparative local case studies. These methods will address how it is that within an overarching state commitment to multiculturalism, policy is negotiated differently in different urban neighborhoods in the two largest cities in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>This research examines the uneven geographies of state multiculturalism and integration policies. It examines how diverse urban populations in different neighborhoods of Dutch cities negotiate an overarching national state commitment to multiculturalism differently, and it highlights the implications of this differential negotiation for policy at various scales and for geographic understandings of multi-ethnic cities. The research will contribute to geographical understanding of urban transformation in multi-ethnic societies, and it may impact teaching and policy in multi-ethnic societies. The project will impact the literature on multiculturalism and the production of urban space, state-immigrant relations, and active citizenship by emphasizing the increasing importance many Western states place on promoting active citizenship as a means for promoting social cohesion in multi-ethnic societies. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

This research focuses on the A.D. 1050-1150 period, when migrants from both ancestral traditions formed multi-ethnic communities in this area centered around Chacoan-style great houses. These great houses represent scaled-down emulations of the monumental architecture found at Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. Chaco Canyon and the smaller great houses found throughout the Four Corners area has been argued to be a socially and/or politically integrated system of unparalleled scale in the ancient American Southwest. However, little research has investigated how great houses articulated with Chaco Canyon or the role great houses played within their local communities. This research aims to do so by evaluating how political competition between great house communities on the margins of the ""Chacoan regional system"" mitigated the social stresses caused by rapid population increase by groups from distinct ethnic traditions.<br/><br/> Research on migrant integration and community organization will better frame studies of identity expression within multi-ethnic communities and will further knowledge of the interplay between group affiliation and cooperation within multi-ethnic groups, questions relevant to studying migrant integration and community identity in contemporary heterogeneous populations worldwide. <br/><br/>This study focuses on the Largo Gap great house and its associated community. The study aims to: (1) characterize the construction and chronology of use at the Largo Gap great house; (2) characterize the Largo Gap support community, and the role of the great house within this community; (3) compare the settlement pattern around, and use of the Largo Gap great house to its two nearest neighbors, Cox Ranch Pueblo and Cerro Pomo; and (4) to explore the articulation between great houses in this region with contemporaneous great house communities across the Four Corners, which will help clarify the nature of the ""Chacoan regional system."" Systematic survey of lands surrounding Largo Gap and limited testing of the Largo Gap great house and associated community sites will provide the data needed to address these questions. These data, when combined with that collected by Duff at the Cox Ranch and Cerro Pomo great house communities, will permit Safi to evaluate models of political competition, multi-ethnic community integration, and great house function at local and regional scales.<br/><br/>This research promotes a wider appreciation for archaeological science and the preservation our national heritage. It also advances increased participation of women in science by training women at all educational levels to conduct archaeological research in the field and laboratory. This project promotes engagement between academia and descendent communities through consultation and research presentations, and engages local residents through community outreach to promote increased understanding of Native American history, the conservation of heritage resources, and to foster relationships between researchers, the descendants of these ancient communities, and the region's current residents."

Social scientists understand little about how multi-ethnic, mixed-race households comprehend and enact racial and ethnic identity or about how they select and interact with their residential neighborhoods. Decisions about ""Where to Live?"" rank among the most important issues that confront mixed-race families because they must select residential locations from among a set of neighborhoods that are typically marked in terms of single racial categories. Neighborhoods shape potential social interactions and thus influence the formation and enactment of ethnic and racial identities within mixed-race households. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine one type of mixed-race household, couples including a non-Latino White (hereafter referred to as ""White"") and a Latino of Mexican heritage (hereafter referred to as ""Mexican"") in one metropolis, the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The doctoral student will examine the multi-scalar interactions of family and family members' racial and ethnic identity formation processes with household and neighborhood contexts. The study will employ a rigorous combination of tabular and cartographic quantitative analysis of geographically detailed confidential census data with qualitative analysis of residential history interviews with Mexican mothers and adult multiracial children from White-Mexican (WM) households. The project will (1) examine the residential distribution of WM households relative to other L.A. area households and characterize the racial identification of multiracial children in WM households relative to household demographic structure and neighborhood racial composition, (2) assess WM family-level perceptions and residential decisions related to the racial and ethnic socialization of children, and (3) evaluate the dual impacts of WM household and neighborhood contexts on the formation and expression of racial and ethnic identity among WM multiracial offspring.<br/><br/>This project will enhance understanding of racial and ethnic identity development by examining two of the multiple social settings (households and neighborhoods) that impact identity formation. This project conceives of the household as both a contextual social setting that affects individual identity and as a subjective unit of collective identity assertion, negotiation, and enactment. Similar analyses are largely absent in academia because of substantive foci upon individuals rather than households. Broader scientific impacts arise from the study's focus on WM households; a mixed-race household type that is far more common that other multiethnic and multiracial partnerships but that is also nearly ignored by researchers. WM households might retain elements of both partners' racial and ethnic identifications and the household's complex racial, and ethnic identity might manifest itself in family residential decisions that are similar to but quite distinct from those of most same-race White or Latino households. WM households might not gravitate towards residential neighborhoods that are dominated by members of either partner's racial group. This research will address the manner with which Latino cultures and racial identities blend into and/or alter those of White America and offer crucial empirical information about where mixed-race households settle within large metropolitan areas. Finally, as research funded by a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award, this implementation of this project will facilitate the establishment of a solid independent research program for a promising young scholar."

As a result, this study will examine the potential impact of the Internet<br/>from the creation and design of web sites through user experiences in comparison to other<br/>communications technologies. The project uses interviews and archival research to explore how the construction and use of web sites reveal interpretations of a multi-ethnic democracy, and how the Internet compares with other media in representing political views of a multi-ethnic democracy.

However, despite the potential effect of immigration and ethnic diversity on racial and ethnic stratification within multiethnic societies, research has yet to provide an examination of the impact of these factors on patterns of social mobility over the life course. While prior research focuses extensively on metropolitan area characteristics related to contemporaneous race and ethnic labor market disparities, the contribution of this research is to examine the multiethnic aspects of communities that affect the career trajectories of American workers. Applying cross-classified multilevel growth curve models to data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and U.S. Census Bureau, this research will provide a comprehensive assessment of the social forces contributing to the differential patterns of intragenerational socioeconomic mobility among race, ethnic, and gender groups in the post-civil rights era. Particular attention is given to the impact of immigration and ethnic diversity on occupational attainment, earnings growth, and acquired work experience of native born workers from young to middle adulthood. The dissemination of this research will impact the broader society by helping researchers, policy makers, teachers, and students to better understand the effects of increasing ethnic diversity on the social and economic well-being of their communities."

Based on four months of field work in each state, the project's primary objective is to provide plausible answers to the following research questions. First, what explains the surprisingly peaceful character of the Russian-titular relationship in each of these states? Second, what explains the variation in the degree to which Russians in each state support attempts by titular elites to create their own newly independent state? Specifically, why are Russian-Latvian relations slightly more than contentioius than Russian-Kazakh relations, and why are both of these relationships far more contentious than Russian-Kyrgyz relations? Field research explores the hypothesis that how titular elites materially and symbolically portary their desires for national self-assertion, and the appropriate role of the Russian minority in this context, shapes the collective Russian response to attempts by titular elites to build their own newly independent state.<br/> Three research methods are applied in each state. First, policy initiatives and rhetoric of the titular elite are analyzed in order to explore how this elite communicates with the Russian minority and how it institutionalizes the status of this group. Second, data on the behavior of the Russian minority, both cooperative and antagonistic, are analyzed to explore the Russian community's response to the titular community, its policies, and its rhetoric. Third, the Russian viewpoint, in terms of the choices which the Russian community defines as realistic in reaction to decisions made by titular elites, is analyzed. Interviews with key representatives of the Russian community provide data on the Russian viewpoint. This Russian perception sheds light on how titular policies and rhetoric affect the behavior of the Russian minority.<br/> Because the project is based on cross-regional work in post-communist Europe (Latvia) and Eurasia (Kyrgyzstan, Kazahkstan), it explores post-communist development in general. Specifically, the project addresses the broad and theoretically challenging question of the conditions under which multiethnic states in any region of the world can weaken the potential for, or avert, violent ethnic conflict. In addition, because it examines the development of ethnic relations in Soviet successor states, the project provides insight into the degree of political stability characterizing each state, which is increasingly relevent in potentially divisive multiethnic states of the post-Cold War era."

When they are not, the consequences can be adverse: contexts marked by poorly formed social relationships can correlate to interethnic conflict. Conversely, social cohesion and cooperation among diverse individuals and groups can have positive social impacts (for example, such contexts can become important trade centers). This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous scientific fieldwork in the study of language and culture, asks what linguistic anthropological evidence exists to explain how cooperation between linguistically and culturally diverse individuals and groups emerges. <br/><br/>Mr. Nikolas Sweet under the supervision of Dr. Judith Irvine of the University of Michigan will how explore interpersonal relationships are formed in heteroglossic, dynamic contexts. This project questions what sociolinguistic evidence exists to explain how cooperation and cohesion is achieved among diverse individuals and groups. The research takes place in a formerly marginalized region in Senegal on the Guinea border, a context once characterized by interethnic conflict which has now become the site of significant trade, transportation, artisanal gold mining, and in-migration from all across Senegal and West Africa. As such, it is a novel site for a sociolinguistic study of how multilingual speakers from diverse backgrounds develop interpersonal relationships. This is a two-phase project that compares a rural context and large regional center, with the aim of exploring differences in the communicative practices between urban and rural centers, and how access to trade networks impacts language use. Through an in-depth study of face-to-face conversations in multiple languages between differentially positioned individuals, this project will be able to investigate how ethnic and national associations--categories that are too often taken for granted--are in fact negotiated in verbal interactions. Finally, this project contributes to understandings of how proximity to national borders affects individuals' linguistic practices."

Previous studies of immigrant assimilation have focused on political, economic, and social assimilation, as well as education and ethnic identity. However, no major study has emphasized the process of cultural assimilation for immigrant second generation youth, which is the focus of this dissertation. This dissertation has three components, all related to cultural assimilation. First, it looks at which aspects of the second generation's culture-consumption, attitudes toward education, modes of behavior, and beliefs-are linked to ethnicity. This project questions the common assumption that culture is always ethnicity-linked, by empirically looking at teenagers' cultural choices and behaviors. Second, this dissertation asks whether the local context matters significantly in shaping the cultural assimilation process for second generation youth, or if the globalization of youth culture has made youth in London and New York more similar than different. In other words, which aspects of culture are more local, more global, and more ethnicity-based? Finally, this dissertation research examines the cultural repertoires from which youth draw and the meanings their cultural expressions have for them. In order to answer these questions about second generation immigrant youth culture, I will conduct ethnographic research in two multiethnic secondary schools-one in London and one in New York City. I will conduct 20 interviews each with second generation Afro-Caribbean, second generation Indian, and native White students in each school. Finally, I will ask 100 students to complete surveys in each school. Thus I plan to obtain a total of 120 in-depth interviews, 200 surveys, and two school ethnographies-half in London and half in New York City. This project's broader impacts include the following: The research has implications for developing models of schooling and teacher training that can best serve children in multi-ethnic environments, which are increasingly prevalent. The project will provide teachers, parents, and policymakers greater understanding of youth culture and its relationship with how children engage with school by providing insights into such questions as: What is the relationship between a teenager's style and his/her attitudes toward education? How should cultural styles be understood by schools and teachers? What cultural scripts or behaviors, if any, might be causing certain groups (Afro-Caribbeans in the UK, African Americans in the US, boys in both countries) to underachieve, and to what extent do which cultural assumptions of teachers and administrators contribute to that underachievement? What cultural tools could be taught to underachieving groups to improve their academic achievement, and what types of professional development will help teachers help students? The individual school research sites will benefit from learning how their students think about their cultural identities, especially their attitudes toward education, feelings about success, and skills for achievement."

We know that states can change some aspects of their citizens' identities, but we know surprisingly little about the bounds of this capacity, in particular regarding the salience of ethnic identity in multiethnic states. This dissertation project is an attempt to systematically analyze whether states can make extensive and purposeful changes to the ethnic identities of their citizens through orchestrated public policy programs.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its theoretical and empirical contributions to the study of ethnic identity. A large number of projects in multiethnic states require the state to reduce the salience of divisive ethnic identities and foster unifying civil identities. Extensive evidence demonstrates that this is necessary for such things as reducing the potential for conflict, increasing the efficiency of public goods provision, and improving the quality of governance. States clearly have the capacity to change some superficial elements of ethnic identity, but can they effect deep and substantive change, as may be necessary to execute many elements of their development strategies? By employing a novel measurement strategy that captures change at superficial and deep-seated levels of ethnic identity, this project offers insights into the bounds of state capacity to meaningfully shape ethnic identity. Furthermore, by analyzing the effects of coordinated public policy programs as well as individual public policies, the research will determine which mechanisms are most effective at shaping the different levels of salience. This provides insights into the fundamental feasibility of many developmental strategies being pursued in multiethnic states. <br/><br/>Examining the effects of the state actions on the salience of ethnic identity requires 1) an effective and theoretically grounded measure of ethnic identity and 2) an ability to isolate the effects of state actions. Ethnic identity is dynamic and multi-layered, requiring that the measurement strategy captures its multiple facets. Social desirability bias, however, prevents asking direct questions on ethnic identity, as responses may reflect social norms rather than actual preferences. Thus the project relies on indirect measures that capture observable behavioral and attitudinal manifestations of different elements of ethnic identity. The research integrates several innovative techniques developed in social psychology and behavioral economics into the measurement strategy. The primary instrument is a survey with embedded experiments. The project also includes interviews, experimental games to measure how conditional trust is on ethnic identity, and social networking data to capture the network manifestations of ethnic preferences. <br/><br/>The effect of state actions on ethnic identity is assessed at two levels. The first captures the aggregate effects of state actions at the macro level by exploiting a natural experiment between Singapore and the Malaysian Island of Penang. These two territories are highly similar demographically, were ruled as a joint political entity for over one century, and had highly similar early post-independence developmental dynamics. Yet their political environments fundamentally diverged starting in 1970 following significant ethnic conflict in both territories. Ethnic identity in Singapore was consistently demobilized through concerted public policy efforts and the absence of an ethnic component in political competition. As a territory of Malaysia, Penang had an extensive federal-level public policy program that consistently mobilized and politicized ethnic identity exogenously imposed on it. Thus these two ethnically heterogeneous territories with nearly identical starting positions have been subject to vastly different state actions for over forty years. By examining how ethnic identity has diverged between the two countries and - more importantly - how it has remained the same despite the differential treatment, we generate important insights into the nature of ethnic identity and its broad responsiveness to state actions. <br/><br/>The second treatment level examines the effect of individual public policies, focusing on education policy and national service. Regarding education policy, the project examines the effect of school type on ethnic identity. The effect of national service is measured via differences in ethnic identity between Malaysian youth who were selected by lottery to complete a three month integrated national service and those of the same age cohort who were not selected. These tests provide insight into the contact hypothesis and the general feasibility of altering the salience and nature of ethnic identity through fostering constructive contact between constituent groups. By collecting individual level data, the research will capture the heterogeneous treatment effects of state actions, and thus permit inferences on the interaction between policy and individual attributes. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the project is associated with its importance to the foreign policy and development communities. Ethnic diversity provides challenges not only to post-colonial and post-conflict states, but to developed states as well. Significant resources are spent on public policy programs designed to reduce the salience of ethnic identities and shape their expressions. However, little systematic research exists to demonstrate that these are fundamentally feasible projects. By examining the effect of different state actions on multiple elements of ethnic identity, this project provides insight into the possibilities and limitations of the state's ability to shape ethnic identity."

To investigate why electoral competition sometimes leads to ethnic polarization, this project focuses on the role that political parties and candidates play in politicizing ethnic cleavages. It seeks to understand why some parties exploit such cleavages to mobilize supporters while others downplay them. The project examines how variation in demographic and political factors affects campaign strategy. Empirically, the project collects data on campaign messages employed by presidential and parliamentary candidates in Kenya. The resulting dataset will be used to examine the factors that encourage or discourage divisive ethnic appeals. By focusing on sub-national variation within one country, the project holds institutional factors constant, making it possible to examine how demographic and political factors affect campaign decisions. It also goes beyond current studies by collecting detailed data on the content of campaign messages employed by a large number of candidates. The project opens further avenues for innovative research by creating a unique dataset that will be made available to other researchers and collaborators. Through collaboration with the University of Nairobi, it creates opportunities for the participation of underrepresented groups. Finally, by investigating the factors that affect campaign strategy, this project contributes to efforts to encourage moderation and stability in ethnically divided societies."

This is a particularly important finding in Africa, where countries are ethnically diverse, democracy is new and weak, and voters lack access to important information about candidates, parties, and democracy. This study will open a new research agenda in ethnic politics: the study of ethnic distance. Numerous studies have found that voters in Africa are most likely to vote for candidates from their own ethnic group, their ""co-ethnics"". However, these studies fail to explain how ethnicity influences the voting behavior of those who do not have a co-ethnic candidate in the race. By some estimates, on average, 40% of the African population will face presidential elections in which they do not have a co-ethnic candidate for whom to vote. Thus, because of the focus on co-ethnicity, our understanding of how ethnicity influences the political behavior of this 40% is extremely limited. This project seeks to explain the role of ethnicity in determining the voting preferences of those without a co-ethnic candidate. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project introduces the concept of ""ethnic proximity"", and measures it through a survey conducted in Liberia. It investigates the possibility that ethnic similarity is a more robust predictor of voter behavior. This is important because it implies that multiethnic coalitions, which are widely believed to benefit democracy (because they reduce civil conflict), are most likely to form and be sustained in societies with sufficiently similar ethnic groups. Diversity may not be the key factor that prohibits building multiethnic coalitions, but it could be the degree of difference among the various ethnic groups that is of greatest consequence. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: If ethnic distance matters for coalition building, and ethnic identities are changeable, then it can also be used in US nation-building efforts. While Liberia is important for US security interests in its own right, as strengthening democracy in Liberia will likely bring greater stability to the region, understanding how ethnicity promotes or hinders the formation of multi-ethnic political coalitions in Liberia can provide a basis to understand how it would work in other areas of the world. The United States has invested substantial amounts of money in Liberia's post-civil war reconstruction over the past 10 years. This study's results could provide insight into the effective use of resources: while money spent developing infrastructure and democratic institutions is necessary, devoting some resources to reconciliation, in the form of public campaigns to highlight ethnic similarities across groups in an unbiased manner rather than blanketed national identity appeals, may enhance the functioning of democratic institutions. More broadly, the US and its allies have struggled to address the ethnic divisions that plague countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.

The site was the capital of a multiethnic, theocratic state that flourished between AD 950 and 1100 and was reserved primarily for funerary and ceremonial purposes. Therefore, it provides a unique opportunity to investigate the role of mortuary practice in the social development and maintenance. The excavations targeted the ceremonial core of the capital, which consists of a large rectangular plaza and surrounding platform mounds with elite cemeteries, and documented material traces of preserving and caring the dead bodies as well as other contemporaneous activities within the plaza. The four analyses proposed by Mr. Matsumoto will focus on the food preparation and consumption among others and explore its nature and relation to the mortuary practice. Mr. Matsumoto hypothesizes that central to the Sicán religion was ancestor veneration, and that it served to consolidate this plural society through attendant feasting activities.<br/><br/>In traditional as well as modern societies shared beliefs and practices serve to create group identity and promote integration among often disparate social elements. Practices relating to religion and burial play such a role. Thus this study has present day relevance because it directly addresses issues of social cohesion and factors which promote social solidarity and effective function.<br/><br/>When explaining why ancestor veneration was practiced, archaeologists have emphasized its economic merits for the cult followers and argued that it helped them demand their rights for limited lands and resources on the basis of their continued occupancy. Contrarily, they have paid little attention to the ideological aspect of ancestor cult, which has been well documented by ethnographers. Mr. Matsumoto focuses on the latter aspect and explores the role of ancestor veneration as a form of ideology for social integration and differentiation through commensal hospitality among the dead and the living of intracultural variability such as social identity and status. Furthermore, many previous studies of mortuary contexts have uncritically invoked ancestor veneration without sufficient empirical support to the point that it was once decried by a British archaeologist that there were too many ancestors. In contrast, Mr. Matsumoto will take a meticulous look at both archaeological contexts and materials to better characterize ancestors and their veneration with reference to ethnological and ethnohistorical resources, and demonstrate how one should approach ancestor veneration and what evidence one would need in order to more appropriately define it in archaeological record.<br/><br/>New findings from this study will enhance the local identity and appreciation of prehispanic predecessors literally as remote ancestors. Recent DNA analyses revealed a genetic link between the Sicán and the present people of the area. The contribution of this study will not be confined to the local level. The ""Sicán Deity"" that represents the Sicán religious art has long been an important icon directly linked to the national identity of modern-day Peru (e.g., the company logo of the national flag carrier and the first of 24 designs for the new coin series). In spite of such a national-level recognition and visibility, however, the nature of the prehispanic religion that created this image is yet to be fully understood. This study will help to orient people's interests not only toward the aesthetics of the representative image, but also toward a better understanding of the Sicán religion and its significance in the Peruvian prehistory. For these purposes, the data and results will be actively made public in different languages in various settings, professional and non-professional."

More specifically, does the ability of regional leaders in the Russian Federation to mobilize citizens along ethnic lines enhance their relative bargaining power vis a vis Moscow, and does this increase in bargaining power affect their ability to successfully bargain with the central government? Intergovernmental bargaining is an important part of all federal systems. This is especially the case in ethnic federations where regions have divergent interests on may dimensions. Intergovernmental bargaining affects the prospects for macro-economic stability as well as the formal political autonomy of the federal regions. Consequently, scholarly understanding of the bases of regional bargaining power, especially the ethnic bases, has profound implications for understanding and assessing the prospects for regional peace and stability in the Russian Federation, as well as in multi-ethnic federal states more generally. While research has been done which addresses the ability of regional elites to mobilize citizens along ethnic lines and how intergovernmental bargaining affects everything from the redistribution of economic resources to the political status of regional governments, there has been almost no work which has attempted to examine how the ability to mobilize citizens increases or decreases the ability of regional leaders to successfully bargain with the central governments. By making clear this link, this research improves our understanding of how the strategies employed and outcomes anticipated by regional leaders in ethnic federations differ from the strategies and outcomes we would expect to see in federations which are not based upon ethnic divisions. Since many of the theoretical frameworks employed by both policy analysts and scholars to grapple with the problems faced by multi-ethnic federations are based upon theories of non-ethnic federations, an understanding of how these frameworks must be modified to fit multi-ethnic federations is of tremendous importance. This dissertation research addresses this question through a combination of cross-regional statistical analysis and case study research. Using statistical methods especially well-suited to deal with problems encountered in the Russian case (small number of cases, non-random sampling, missing data), it is shown that variations in bargaining power has an important effect on the distribution of net transfer payments to that region. Having demonstrated the general importance of ethnic mobilization, interview and archival data drawn from case studies in Tatarstan and Nizhinii Novgorod is used to flesh out and elaborate the ways in which regional elites are able to mobilize citizens and how this bolsters the bargaining power of these elites vis a vis the central government."

The wild-type p53 protein acts as a controller of cell growth and cell death. The negative feedback regulator of p53, Mdm2, is critically important to sustain development. p53 activates expression of mdm2 and the Mdm2 protein in turn inactivates p53 by either repressing its transcriptional activity or facilitating its degradation by the proteasome. The Bargonetti laboratory and colleagues are among only a few groups that have provided evidence that Mdm2 forms both soluble as well as chromatin-bound complexes with p53 in human cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that this process exemplifies an important basic transcription regulation program where Mdm2 influences the recruitment of factors to chromatin to prevent functional transcription, but this has yet to be fully elucidated. Human cell lines are used to investigate the chemical nature and function of p53-Mdm2 chromatin-associated complexes and their impact on transcription. The Bargonetti group is carrying out basic research in combination with a strong broader impact objective to produce the next generation of multicultural and multiethnic scientists. The core objectives of the project are the following: 1) Determine if Mdm2 blocks transcription initiation or elongation at p53 target genes. 2) Characterize the role of Mdm2 on histone modifications at p53 target genes. 3) Determine if Mdm2 and p300 act as competitors for the p53 transcription factor in Mdm2 over-expression cell culture models. 4) Examine the regulation of chromatin-associated p53 by Mdm2 proteins produced from alternatively spliced mdm2. Based on the results obtained from this project the ability of the alternate forms of Mdm2 to influence p53 transcriptional activity, recruitment of p300 and PCAF, and regulation of local and distal histone modification will be determined. 5) Integrate research and teaching as a method to excite the next generation, multiethnic, science work force.<br/><br/>The project being carried out by the Bargonetti laboratory group integrates research and teaching as a method to excite the next generation, multiethnic, science work force.

The sample is large, comprised of about 1500 early adolescents in two cohorts who had been recruited in 6th grade for a longitudinal study of peer harassment in middle school. The sample is also ethnically diverse, with participants who are African American, Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Caucasian. Latino and Asian students also differ in immigrant history. Data on students' social adjustment, emotional well-being, achievement attitudes, and academic outcomes will be gathered in Fall and Spring during 9th for Cohort 2 and during 10th grade for Cohort 1. The specific aims of the project are to examine: (1) how social risk in middle school (i.e., having a reputation as an aggressor or victim of harassment) affects the high school transition; (2) whether there are particular pathways to (mal)adjustment that are predicted by social risk; and (3) how the transition process is influenced by contextual factors such as ethnic identity, the ethnic composition of high schools, and immigrant history. The data collected during this one-year project will help assure that there are multiple time points to examine the high school transition as a process that unfolds over time. Cutting-edge statistical techniques will be used to model trajectories of change in academic achievement, including growth, decline, and the possibility of recovery. Findings will provide new insights into the social and cultural underpinnings of a smooth versus disruptive high school transition.<br/><br/>The proposed research can have broader impact in two ways. First, the study of social vulnerability in 9th and 10th grade is relevant to educational practice because those are the grades when high school youth who have become alienated from school are most at risk for dropping out. Teachers and other educational professionals need to become better informed about the importance of the social lives of adolescents to sustained achievement strivings. Second, the multiethnic focus of the research and the timeliness of the topic provide an excellent context for attracting and mentoring talented students of color, at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. The Principal Investigator has an excellent track record of fostering the intellectual and professional development of students of color."

Both accounts by Spanish explorers as well as archaeological data suggest that this valley exerted an influence disproportionate to its size. Although this oasis is set in one of the world's driest deserts, irrigation has long permitted year-round cultivation of crops that are not available at higher elevations. Spanish historic documents state that colonists from highland polities with centers as much as 200 kilometers to the East sent settlers to the valley's middle elevations to cultivate maize, peppers and cotton to send back to their homelands. Dr. Goldstein and his team wish to determine how far this pattern extends back in time. Three factors play major roles in the culture history of Peru. First, the country is characterized by strong altitudinal zonation and environments change rapidly from arid coastland desert, through mid latitudes, high Andean plateau and finally tropical eastern Amazonian lowland. Secondly, the archaeological record indicates the presence of strong regional traditions which continue for thousands of years in time. Finally, the a series of empires, of which the Inca was the most recent, emerged to consolidate large portions of Bolivia and Peru. Archaeologists wish to understand how these factors interacted. How did local traditions maintain at least a modicum of independence under a series of larger centralized regimes? How were empires and smaller groups organized to take advantage of the resources which different altitudinal zones offered? The Moquegua Valley, because of its clear bounded nature and its rich resources offers an excellent venue to study such questions. Dr. Goldstein has conducted research in the region for several years and data indicate the imprint of all major empire expansions as well as a strong local tradition. He wishes to determine the types of interactions which occurred and believes that a multi-ethnic (live and let live) model best applies. With National Science Foundation support he will conduct one additional field season of work. He will complete a full scale survey of the valley and update a maps of sites and other cultural features. Surface material will be collected and on the basis of ceramics both date and cultural affiliation will be determined. Radiocarbon dates will provide absolute ages. On this basis it will then be possible to reconstruct cultural interactions over time. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide insight into the social organization of a early state level societies in a heterogeneous environmental context. It will yield data of interest to many archaeologists and provide training to both undergraduate and graduate students."

Does ethnic diversity cause economic underdevelopment, and if so, how? This dissertation research seeks to explain why so many ethnically diverse countries are underdeveloped, and how some have managed to avoid the poverty traps in which so many of their peers languish. Government institutions provide the key. The incentive structures defined by these institutions determine how ethnicity is channeled into or away from politics and the political allocation of scarce resources: some institutions produce relatively benign outcomes, while others favor zero-sum redistributive politics based on ethnic identity. <br/><br/>To accomplish this goal, the PI employs a multi-method research design. Econometric analysis of cross-national data will allows the PI to test the impact of ethnic diversity and government institutions at the level of the system against a broad sample of countries. To explore the microfoundations of the aggregation process, the PI will collect individual-level data in Lebanon and Yemen via a combination of elite interviews, population surveys, and vignette experiments attached to the surveys. <br/><br/>This dissertation research fills several important gaps in our understanding of how ethnic diversity affects economic development. It contributes to political science by expanding our understanding of how government institutions channel, and possibly pre-empt, potential social cleavages. It augments our understanding of economic development in divided societies by analyzing the ways in which latent cleavages are either reinforced or diluted by the institutions that translate them into political competition. Finally, this project has potentially far-reaching policy implications. Insofar as government institutions are potential policy levers, understanding how they function in different societies can help policymakers select institutions that can help mitigate the potentially negative effects of ethnic divisions.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impact, this dissertation will help inform policymaker decisions toward appropriate government responses and institutions with the aim of mitigating the impact of ethnically-based political competition on economic development. Hence, beyond its interest to academics, it speaks to the puzzles and concerns facing government officials in ethnically diverse states, as well as those working for international development agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. A better understanding of the role government institutions play in magnifying or reducing the impact of ethnic diversity on development will aid in formulating appropriate devel-opment policy."

Population growth in hazard prone areas is likely to reverse this trend unless prompt and effective measures are taken. Hazard-resistant land use and building construction practices could help to contain loss of life despite population growth, but there are economic and political barriers to implementing them. Improvements in the ability to evacuate threatened populations will thus be needed.<br/><br/>This research project addresses this need by developing an Evacuation Management Decision Support System (EMDSS) to assist public officials in monitoring a hazard's onset and determining when and where to initiate evacuations. A large data base on warning/preparation times, compliance/spontaneous evacuation rates, evacuation route utilization, and evacuation costs for both risk area residents and transients (especially business and tourist travelers), and economic impacts to business due to evacuations will be constructed using multiple surveys. Data on warning and preparation times, compliance and spontaneous evacuation rates, and evacuation route utilization are sparse; data on evacuation costs (as opposed to losses from disaster impact) are lacking in the literature. This database will feed the EMDSS to provide public officials support in facing hazards, such as hurricanes and help them balance the threat to public safety against evacuation costs under time constraints and uncertainty. <br/><br/>Valuable disciplinary goals will be reached through the collection and analysis of data that advance theoretical disaster research. In addition, the project will perform a major interdisciplinary function by integrating social psychological theories with those from transportation planning to develop an improved evacuation time estimation model, and with theories from household and business economics to develop an evacuation cost model. These perspectives will be integrated with concepts from decision analysis and decision support systems to produce the EMDSS. <br/><br/>Broader social utility will result through significant advances in technology to support evacuation decisions. This work will add value to and leverage the hazard vulnerability analysis and evacuation planning work performed by the Hazard Reduction & Recovery Center for the Texas Governor's Division of Emergency Management (DEM) for over twenty years. This close relationship with an operational agency is unique among university-based hazard/disaster research centers. The relationship between HRRC and DEM provides an unparalleled opportunity for user input into software design and accelerated technology transfer to state and local emergency managers. The research will be coordinated with personnel from the Taiwanese National Science and Technology Program for Hazard Mitigation (NAPHM), who are interested in collaborating in the extending the EMDSS to evacuations from landslides and inland flooding. The Hazard Reduction & Recovery Center has a Memorandum of Agreement with NAPHM that has promoted cooperative exchanges between the two centers.<br/><br/>Finally, graduate students will benefit by their involvement in survey development, data collection, and EMDSS development and evaluation. A broader group of graduate students will benefit from inclusion of this material in the investigators' environmental hazard management courses (especially the one on disaster response planning) and in a future edition of the textbook, Behavioral Foundations of Community Emergency Planning.

This time of early interactions among the Upper Great Lakes region's original inhabitants, displaced Native newcomers, and European explorers resulted in hybridized, multiethnic communities that persisted into the French Colonial period. Ms. Walder is investigating several important aspects of this socially, economically, and politically dynamic period: 1) changes through time in the material practices and performance of social identity as expressed in personal ornaments; 2) regional variation in the technologies used to transform European materials, such as copper-based kettles, into adornments; and 3) spatial and temporal patterns in the chemical composition of glass beads, which reflect the extent and timing of glass bead trade in the region. Studying the production and exchange of socially-meaningful adornments will help to clarify the beginnings of global-scale interaction and trade from the standpoint of technology and material culture. This project contributes to recent theoretical discussions of identity in cultural contact and early colonial situations. In contrast with the Northeast or island settings like colonial Hawaii, where early contact was more sustained, the Upper Great Lakes region experienced infrequent and intermittent early European contacts, allowing it to be examined as a locale of historically documented hybridity and multi-ethnicity. <br/><br/>The primary methods that Ms. Walder will apply are physical attribute analysis of copper-based metal ornaments and chemical compositional analysis of glass beads. By comparing the find-spots of chemically similar glass beads to the distribution of contemporaneous archaeological sites and discrete Native occupation areas as labeled on historic maps, it may be possible to determine if socially distinct groups had access to different European materials or if access patterns changed through time. Attribute analysis of metal ornaments and waste fragments that result from their manufacture will allow the comparison of metal-working practices of different contemporary social groups, in order to understand if or how social identity influences the ornament production process. Ms. Walder's research demonstrates the potential value of investigating unpublished or under-published collections using relatively new analysis methods that were not used or were unavailable for earlier studies. <br/><br/>This research will produce an on-line data set useful for anthropologists worldwide who are engaged in the study of cultures in contact and the beginnings of the colonial world. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and through public presentations in various venues throughout the Midwest. Broader impacts of this research include updating of museum curation strategies and interpretive displays and involving descendant communities in the research process. While working with the museum collections, Ms. Walder will organize and digitize original field notes, locate missing artifact information, repackage artifacts in dire need of conservation, assist curators in the identification of historic artifacts, and collaborate with curators to ensure continued research accessibility to the collections. Updated interpretive displays that present the results of Ms. Walder's study are planned at several curating institutions, including the Madeline Island Museum and Rock Island State Park. Finally, this research project will foster relationships and collaborations with descendant Meskwaki, Menominee, and Ho-Chunk community members in the Midwest."

In addition to the scientific foundational needs addressed by this project, there are U.S. workforce development considerations being addressed, training next generation of U.S. researchers how to communicate and perform multi-disciplinary work, multi-institutional research, and to productively working in collaborative, multi-ethnic, virtual teams, as these formats are progressively being used across all enterprises. To do so, EBICS: VITA REU will immerse scholars into virtual research teams at one of three institutions (Georgia Tech, Univ. of Illinois, or MIT) with an independent project and mentor that contributes to a larger research goal aligned with EBICS grand challenge. Targeted approaches for recruiting cohorts of students traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines (women, underrepresented minority (URM) students, students with disabilities, and students from schools with limited STEM research opportunities) will occur with a set plan in place having already being initiated.<br/><br/>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>This project acknowledges the support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers to train the next generation U.S. workforce to function successfully in virtual teams that are multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary, and multi-ethnic.

EBICS is also defining quantitative design principles for creating such machines, and for understanding and controlling the flow of information (genetic, biochemical, mechanical, electrical) within and between cells, in a dynamic, multi-scale fashion. This involves integration of concepts from tissue engineering, systems biology, and synthetic biology, as well as established disciplines such as electrical engineering and computer science; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; biomedical engineering; biology; chemistry. Research and educational activities will incorporate REU scholars into virtual, multi-institutional research Working Groups, with independent projects contributing to a larger research thrust. Video- and tele-conferencing during the research experience will provide committed professional development on presenting in virtual formats. All virtual teams and REU scholars will travel and meet face-to-face at the annual EBICS retreat to interact with their Working Group, as well as other EBICS faculty from Georgia Tech, Univ. of Illinois, and MIT, EBICS graduate and postdoctoral trainees, providing a broader network far beyond that of just being at one institution.

In Sub-Saharan Africa's democratizing states, however, politicians are often seen attempting to minimize the competition they face by building parties that monopolize votes along ethnic lines (Mozaffar et al. 2003, Horowitz 1985). Yet, legislative elections across African countries reveal considerable variation in the extent to which ethnic identities map directly onto partisan alignments. While the votes of certain ethnic groups are monopolized by single parties, other groups have multiple parties that effectively vie for their support. This sub-national variation in levels of intra-ethnic party competition, both across time and space, requires theoretical explanation and empirical analysis if we are to understand the future of democracy in Africa's multiethnic societies. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its examination of how politicians build local bases of party support in countries with limited democratic experience. The research examines the following questions: Why are some politicians able to build ethnic party monopolies while others fail? How are such ethnic parties sustained? Under what conditions does intra-ethnic or intra-regional competition emerge? How do economic and sociological factors affect the emergence of political competition within groups? The research suggests that intra-group electoral competition is dependent on the access parties have to economic resources. This project will therefore examine whether a party's influence over the distribution of economic resources affects its ability to sustain its political monopoly over the votes of co-ethnics. This argument challenges two commonly offered explanations regarding political competition in Africa, namely: the role of electoral rules and clientelism. Although focusing on electoral institutions provides theoretical expectations on the number of parties and the type of competition one ought to observe in a particular district, the theory fails to explain the variation that exists in the electoral options available to voters given similar electoral rules. In addition, theories that rely on clientelism fail to explain why politicians would create parties to compete with already existent co-ethnic parties, given the group's access to state resources is improved by presenting the president with a unified group. <br/><br/>This argument is tested using sub-national data from two African countries that share similar economic, political, and sociological characteristics, yet exhibit considerable variation in the electoral options available to voters across ethnic groups: Kenya and Malawi. To assess the nature of party competition at the sub-national level within these countries, data will be collected on the campaign pledges made by politicians at the local level: their number, substance, and the relationship between pledges made by different parties. Party pledges are a valid measure of the nature of party competition because they reflect the issues around which parties seek to compete; that is, parties update their pledges in response to what opposing parties offer. The study's design also holds many of the independent variables constant to establish the link between the hypothesized independent variable, economic diversity, and the observed variation on the dependent variable, constituency level party systems. Besides collecting data on economic diversity, party pledges and party competition, the project includes a survey and semi-structured interviews with politicians and business leaders to better demonstrate the links between business and politics. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research are connected with its contributions to scholarly and policy concerns related to democratization. The research should inform debates on the link between economic resources and party system development. Understanding the dynamics behind political competition is important to move beyond common assumptions that ethnic rivalries in multi-ethnic societies are the reason for democracy's failure. In fact, the research will demonstrate that intra-ethnic competition promotes democratic practices; in so doing it will suggest reforms aimed at promoting democratization and development over the longer term."

Why does conflict break out between groups in some communities but not in others? Such questions are investigated through a study of communal conflicts in Ethiopia, a poor country where local order often breaks down as neighboring groups take up arms to resolve their disputes. By examining patterns of conflict at the district level, this research project aims to explain how institutions of local governance influence tensions produced by social divides and resource scarcity. Specifically, this study examines to what extent the outbreak of violence depends on the representation of different groups in district-level administration and the intensity of weather-related shocks to local crop production or animal rearing.<br/><br/>Ethiopia provides an ideal context for studying how communal conflicts arise through the interaction between institutions, identities, and resources. While the country's districts vary considerably in levels of ethnic diversity and land productivity, decentralizing reforms adopted in the past 15 years have empowered all districts to make decisions over budget expenditures, land use, and agricultural inputs. The distribution of district resources may not affect the welfare of citizens during normal times, but a district's authority over land and water use becomes a critical issue during the prolonged periods of scarcity often confronted in a country that depends on rain-fed agriculture. Whether local groups monopolize or share control of district administration could therefore influence the outbreak of violence between them.<br/><br/>To assess the causes of communal conflict in Ethiopia, this project will develop a dataset of conflicts found in all districts and undertake ethnographic studies of two selected districts over a two-year period. First, the project will draw on government and non-government sources of information to assemble a dataset of local conflicts across Ethiopia's 550 districts between 1995 and 2006. The district-level data will allow for a statistical analysis that tests whether the outbreak of violence can be attributed to institutional, demographic, or economic factors. Second, the project will use the district-level dataset to identify two districts for in-depth ethnographic study. Interviews and focus groups will be organized with members of selected communities to establish how, in practice, administrative authority, demographic pressures, and resource constraints heighten fear or competition between groups. These ethnographic studies will further help to establish how episodes of communal conflict are understood in their local socio-cultural context, overwhelming traditional mechanisms of dispute resolution and possibly creating cycles of recurrent violence. <br/><br/>This project is relevant to the stability of countries in Africa and other developing regions, which share many of Ethiopia's economic and political characteristics. Its research will directly address the impact of decentralizing reforms, which are often promoted as an institutional solution to the competition over resources in multiethnic countries. Yet, it remains to be shown how decentralization affects the outbreak of violence between groups, particularly when those reforms can bring about a realignment of power at the local level. This project's findings will provide a better understanding of how institutional changes interact with demographic and resource pressures in fragile states. The lessons derived from this research will permit scholars and policymakers to craft institutional reforms better suited to preventing communal conflicts that often degenerate into complex humanitarian crises."

While this study is firmly grounded in material culture, architecture, and the use of space the intent is to use data generated through remote sensing as a primary source for interpretation. Traditionally, the data generated through techniques such as gradiometry, ground-penetrating radar, and electrical resistance have only been used as guides for where to excavate to evaluate ideas and learn about the past. In part the emphasis on remote sensing is a conscious effort to reduce the impacts (of excavation) on the archaeological record of Etowah -- a precious resource to some and sacred to others. Additionally, the emphasis on remote sensing data is intended to push the interpretive limits of those data.<br/><br/>This project to explore the creation of the social groups living at Etowah through the built environment will contribute to continuing efforts to understand the formation of complex, often multi-ethnic communities of the Mississippian period. Because the establishment and creation of the physical space of a community is a human universal, what is learned from these efforts will contribute to broader attempts, spanning time and geography, to explore the creation of society using space and architecture. Methodologically, this project attempts to push the limits of non-invasive investigations by asking questions of geophysical data that traditionally have been asked only of excavated data. The results may make it possible to study the development of prehistoric communities like Etowah using only geophysical data and information from very limited and targeted excavations.<br/><br/><br/>Today the Etowah site is a state park and a prehistoric archaeological site famous for having some of the largest earthen platform mounds built in the Deep South, and producing some of the most impressive art objects ever found in the Southeast. In the past it was a thriving Native American community and capital of a larger polity: a role it played for some 550 years during the Mississippian period of the Native American past. Etowah's archaeological record not only captures the structure of those communities, but it also contains traces of the process through which those Etowah communities were formed. Communities are collections of people who, through various means, forge themselves into a social unit with a shared sense of identity, history, and community practice. Community creation is a complex and ongoing process that is part of the universal human experience, and it is encoded into the use of space, architecture, and material culture. This project uses remote sensing data and limited archaeological excavation to explore how Etowah's built environment and associated material culture were transformed with each new incarnation of the Etowah community and in turn examine the process of community creation.<br/><br/>This project to explore the creation of the social groups living at Etowah through the built environment will contribute to continuing efforts to understand the formation of complex, often multi-ethnic communities of the Mississippian period.

The archaeological data will be collected by field school students as they learn the process of archaeology, and the geophysical and archaeological data produced will form the basis for a graduate student theses. It is also designed to involve descendant communities in the exploration and interpretation of their history. Members of culturally affiliated Creek and Cherokee communities will be invited to participate in the data collection, the interpretation of the results and in learning from those interpretations."

This political development may represent one of the most extensive experiments with indigenous autonomy in all of Latin America, given the degree of autonomy granted, its formal-legal nature, and the sheer number of citizens involved (approximately 1.25 million Mexicans, just over 1% of the national population, now live under ""traditional"" local governments). No other Mexican state has ever replicated the Oaxacan reform, and even in Oaxaca autonomy was granted only selectively, to a subset of the state's indigenous communities. This has resulted in a complex mosaic of local political institutions, in which some indigenous-majority towns are governed by local custom, while others are not. <br/><br/>Scholars and policy makers have divergent views about the effects of this type of political arrangement. Proponents of the Oaxacan reform, for example, argued that autonomy would help maintain strong communal attachments in indigenous communities, thus protecting their languages and cultures while reconciling local political customs with state and federal political institutions. Yet for the most part these claims have not been tested against empirical facts, and there is some reason to be skeptical that autonomy has had purely salutary effects. To give just two examples: some scholars have argued that autonomy would increase the power of local strongmen while inhibiting the federal government's ability to protect individual rights. Others have speculated that the Oaxacan reform might harm indigenous communities in the long run by exposing indigenous customs to greater federal scrutiny and oversight. Importantly, these specific claims about the effects of local autonomy in Mexico are also applicable to other areas in which federal governments might consider (or might have already implemented) autonomy arrangements for indigenous minorities, including in the United States and Canada.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal is associated with its intensive study of institutions in multi-ethnic societies. While many countries are faced with the challenge of integrating minority groups into the larger political system in a way that is respectful and acceptable to both, the nature of the political reforms in Oaxaca has created a particularly good research setting for investigating the effects of different strategies for integration. In a narrow sense, this research will determine whether or not local autonomy in the Mexican context actually confers several of the effects that are commonly attributed to it. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the study extend from its focus on how political institutions can protect or harm the rights and cultures of ethnic minority groups. The results of this research project should interest scholars and policy-makers in countries that struggle with the types of political conflict common to multiethnic societies."

Field-research is grounded in three ethnically-cleansed Bosnian localities - Bosnian Croat-controlled Jajce, Bosniak-controlled Travnik, and Bosnian Serb-controlled Derventa - which were multi-ethnic places before the war.

Although it is assumed that such multicultural education will foster harmonious relations among different ethnic groups at the university and in the broader society at large, this assumption has yet to be empirically tested in any rigorous manner. This project aims to achieve a process-oriented understanding of the ways in which a multicultural educational environment influences the development of intergroup attitudes and behaviors over the college years. Gaining a satisfactory understanding of the process by which the educational experience influences intergroup attitudes and behaviors would help answer the more general question of whether or not a multicultural educational experience actually increases or decreases intergroup tension. Several university experiences will be explored, including: a) the formal contents of course curricula; b) the informal and university sponsored extra-curricular activities; c) membership in various types of student organizations (e.g., fraternities, sororities, minority student organizations, and support groups); d) experience with conflict resolution programs; and e) dormitory living arrangements. Specific questions to be addressed include whether or not ""ethnic studies"" courses (e.g., African-American history) and membership in ""ethnic"" student organizations (e.g., African-American, Chinese-American student clubs) actually exacerbate or attenuate ethnic conflict and students' willingness to interact with people from other ethnic and racial groups.<br/><br/>These issues will be addressed by use of a longitudinal study of the freshman class admitted to UCLA in the fall of 1996 (approximately 2,000 students). The students have been interviewed once a year since their time of entry, and interviews will continue once a year until the students graduate (most of the students are expected to graduate in the spring of 2001). Measures were taken of students' baseline intergroup attitudes, behaviors, and expectations of the university environment before their entry into college (Summer 1996), and three additional waves of data concerning these attitudes, behaviors, and university activities have been collected.<br/><br/>Because of its high degree of ethnic diversity, the UCLA campus offers a unique opportunity to study the institutional factors that both facilitate and undermine the degree to which students engage in positive interactions with members of different ethnic groups. The knowledge gained from this unique panel study is hoped to facilitate the development of programs and structures that will enable our highly multiethnic society to continue to function in a constructive and productive manner in the future."

Two common responses are migration and aggregation, movements that can generate both multi-ethnic communities and communities in diaspora. A multi-ethnic community shares a place, but is separated by culture. A community in diaspora shares a culture, but is spatially dispersed. Both are challenging to sustain.<br/><br/>With National Science Foundation support, the Center for Desert Archaeology will examine evidence for both community types in southwestern New Mexico during the late prehistoric period, an interval of environmental change, social upheaval, and demographic collapse. In the late 13th century Kayenta groups from drought-stricken northeastern Arizona walked over 300 kilometers to the river valleys of southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Southern Arizona valleys were already occupied by established Hohokam irrigation communities whose residents were culturally distinct from the Kayenta migrants. Results of a previous NSF grant (No. 0342661) indicate prolonged conflict between Kayenta and Hohokam in some regions. Elsewhere, integrative religious and cultural institutions developed within two generations resulting in a mixed Hohokam-Kayenta identity. In addition, a Kayenta community in diaspora that linked the scattered migrants and their descendants can be traced for at least three generations. Valuable goods (particularly obsidian for weapons) and information regarding ceramic style (with ritual significance) was circulated by this spatially dispersed, but culturally connected, community.<br/><br/>When the population of southern Arizona plummeted in the late 14th century, limited evidence suggests some of the mixed Kayenta-Hohokam groups migrated into southwestern New Mexico where they joined small Kayenta populations living in a relatively isolated frontier. This second migration resulted in the formation of a number of villages along the Upper Gila River tributaries and in the Mimbres Valley. The current project will test this basic premise with a much larger data set and examine how these 14th century communities were organized. Did many of these villages belong to a revitalized Kayenta community that had found a new homeland? Alternatively, did Hohokam-Kayenta mixing and a century of dispersal render Kayenta identity meaningless? If so, was each village an independent community with only weak ties to other villages?<br/><br/>Research objectives will be achieved by 1) demographic reconstruction at 50-year resolution based on a recently refined ceramic chronology, 2) source, frequency, and stylistic analyses of relevant decorated ceramics, and 3) source, frequency, and technological analyses of obsidian artifacts and samples. Use of existing, unanalyzed collections from sites in and around the project area will be emphasized. These collections are curated in various Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Ohio repositories. In addition, ceramic and obsidian artifacts will be obtained from several unsampled sites with minimal impact, either by surface collection or small excavation units in trash mounds. Of particular interest is the only known village near the primary obsidian source used by Kayenta migrants in southern Arizona. This important site will be tested by a field school for undergraduate students from Hendrix College, Arkansas and staffed by University of Arizona graduate students, giving valuable training to both.<br/><br/>This study will enhance understanding of migration and community formation during intervals of severe stress and demographic collapse. It will also provide a perspective on diasporas from the vantage point of traditional societies where pedestrian travel was the only means of transportation.

North of San Francisco Bay. Fort Ross was founded in 1812 by the Russian-American Company, a mercantile monopoly that represented Russia's interests in the lucrative North Pacific fur trade. It served as a staging area for sea otter and fur seal hunts along the coast of California and as an agricultural community for raising crops and livestock until 1841 when it was sold and disbanded. The Company assembled an international, multi-ethnic workforce at Fort Ross that was divided into four major classes or estates: `Russians,` `Creoles,` `Aleuts,` and `Indians.` The Aleuts, imported from the Aleutian Islands served primarily as hunters while the `Indians` consisted primarily of Kaashaya Pomo, a local tribe. These Pomos performed a variety of tasks - tending livestock, working in agricultural fields and hauling clay for brick production. Each group lived in its own habitation area near Fort Ross and the goal of Dr. Lightfoot's current project is to examine the social organization and behavior patterns of this Pomo community. With one year of support, Dr. Lightfoot and his colleagues will lay the groundwork for a larger scale excavation. They will conduct archival research and also interview lineal Pomo descendants of Fort Ross inhabitants. The team will carry out a topographic survey of the site to identify middens and other surface features. This will be augmented by a geophysical survey to locate subsurface counterparts. Intensive surface collection will be conducted and limited excavations made in promising areas. One of the best ways to understand how cultures function is to observe how they adapt in new contexts and Fort Ross provides an excellent situation to utilize such an approach. The prehistoric Pomo are well documented archaeologically and through excavation at Fort Ross it will be possible to see how what cultural practices are selectively maintained, dropped or modified in a unique multi-ethnic context. Previous research has focused on Russian and Aleut portions of the site and this Pomo study will provide valuable comparative data. The project involves many participants, including Pomo and will serve a valuable training function."

It posits that such identities cannot be taken for granted. Rather, they are constructed in the course of a historical process and in that process, law and legal systems play a part. Also, the project focuses on how law, as a crucial force in shaping identities, influences ethnic conflict in this multi-ethnic state. Drawing on archival records related to customary law and the complexity of legal systems experienced by the people of Sri Lanka, the study provides a unique historical perspective of the combination of local and transnational forces triggering ethnic conflict in this nation-state. Further, this historical analysis provides the basis for introducing a general theoretical perspective for advancing understanding ethnic conflict, focusing on the indirect role played by changing legal orders. Finally, the study shows that the influence of global sociolegal phenomena on nation building has historical antecedents and therefore, is not unique to contemporary events in Eastern Europe and elsewhere."

The project seeks to grasp how diverse ways of attributing responsibility for misfortune and describing the agency of humans, spirits, and ritual objects impact the construction of seemingly objective differences between ethnic communities. The researcher will record and analyze how people talk about misfortune and describe responsibility in different social settings: (1) at a Hindu Surinamese oracle and temple, (2) at an Afro-Surinamese Shrine and church, and (3) in everyday talk in both communities. The research also comparatively records and analyzes narratives of the Surinamese civil war to discern the impact of cultural and religious logics of explanation on the interpretation of this national crisis. <br/><br/>The research will contribute to a clearer understanding of how people in contemporary multi-ethnic societies create and understand ethnic and religious differences, while observing the implication of such concepts for the practices of all areas of social life, from politics to the market. By explaining how responsibility and misfortune are attributed and transformed in a society simultaneously culturally hybrid and socially segregated, the research will provide an incisive analysis of human social and cultural difference.

It seeks to explain why one individual reacts with physical aggression while another does not when faced with what both perceive to be a threat from a member of the ethnic outgroup. The import of answers to this question cannot be overstated: Low-level physical interethnic aggression of the type I seek to explain (i.e. riots, small-group, and individual-level interethnic aggression), plagues an ever-increasing number of countries worldwide. This type of aggression is perhaps nowhere more present than in Israel, the focus of this project. To improve conflict resolution efforts and to promote more peaceful multi-ethnic communities, we must understand what drives the individual decision to engage in physical interethnic aggression.<br/><br/>The project will analyze the interactions between Israel's two largest ethnic groups: Jewish-Israelis and Arab-Israelis (restricted to those 18-yrs. and older who have citizenship within the state). After gathering both qualitative and quantitative data on the number and type of aggressive incidents between members of these ethnic groups during the years 2000-2008, the researcher will invite a stratified sample of 600 university-aged young adults from around Israel to participate in a survey and an experiment. The survey will gather individual-level data that will be used to evaluate various hypotheses that seek to explain interethnic aggression. Four weeks after taking the survey, these same individuals will be invited to a research lab to participate in the experiment to safely gather interethnic aggression data. The resulting aggression data will be analyzed alongside the survey results and qualitative data to reach final conclusions.<br/><br/>Within Israel, most organizational attempts at preventing interethnic aggression rest on some variation of Allport?s ""contact hypothesis,"" the idea that individuals will not aggress against those with whom they have considerable contact. As such, ""ethnic encounter"" contact groups of various types dot the country. However, many activists and scholars currently doubt that these groups mitigate aggression. This project looks beyond ""contact"" to identify factors that motivate interethnic aggression in the hope that a more complete understanding of these motivations will provide organizations with new direction as they craft policies and programs to improve or replace these groups. Once the project is completed in Israel, it will be run in other countries and contexts as well."

The research will focus on scientists who researched the geology, paleontology, anthropology, and archaeology of China's northwestern and southwestern frontiers. This vast space, encompassing Xinjiang, Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai, Tibet, Sichuan, and Yunnan, had historically not only been a geographical border zone, but also a zone of cross-cultural encounters. The research of foreign and Chinese scientists in the frontier in the first half of the 20th century resulted in the discovery of prehistoric cultures and the famous Peking Man, as well as in pioneering work in ethnological studies on the frontier regions non-Han people. This project examines how concerns with human civilization, the individual search for intellectual identity, and national interests motivated these scientists to explore the Chinese frontier; and how ideas were exchanged and shared among scientists in certain intellectual networks. Ultimately, it highlights the tensions between participating in global scientific community and the desire for the indigenization of imported knowledge systems experienced by Chinese scientists. This project argues that ideas and debates in the international scientific arena had a great impact on the formation of the concept of modern ""China"" as originated in North China and the notion of ""Chinese"" as a multi-ethnic group. Moreover, it contends that Euro-American scientific imperialism and Sinocentrism were not antagonistic. The approach of this project elucidates the entangled histories of Chinese nationalism and scientific imperialism, and demonstrates that the frontier is a space for contestation against the ""myth"" of China. It also sheds new light on the intellectual history of science and social history of scientists of modern China."

The city was highly planned, with a monumental urban epicenter and densely settled neighborhoods that incorporated a multi-ethnic population of immigrants who arrived from other parts of Mexico and Central America. Among the enigmas that still pertain to the study of this early American metropolis are (1) its tempo and processes of urbanization; (2) the principal factors that fueled its growing population; (3) its political organization; and (4) what architectural complexes served as seats of governance and administration. These issues are critical for improving current understanding of the deep history of the Americas and the human creation of the earliest cities and states across the globe.

Dr. David M. Carballo and Dr. Kenneth G. Hirth will direct a collaborative three-year project involving an international team of interdisciplinary researchers at the ancient city of Teotihuacan, Mexico. During its height in the early first millennium AD Teotihuacan was the largest city in the Americas and one of the largest in the world. Today, being a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the most visited ruins in the Americas, Teotihuacan is of great interest to a broad audience. <br/><br/>Though Teotihuacan is famed for its high-level of civic planning, cosmopolitan populace, and broad economic reach, such issues require more intensive investigations within understudied portions of the city. Investigations of this project focus on the Tlajinga district, a cluster of neighborhoods to the south of Teotihuacan that was inhabited by a lower socioeconomic stratum of the city's populace, was the locus of intensive utilitarian craft production, and is bisected by the terminus of the city's central artery named the Street of the Dead by the later Aztecs. The Tlajinga district provides an opportune setting for examining issues of broad interest to social and behavioral sciences and represents a minimally explored portion of the city whose archaeological record is threatened by contemporary urbanization surrounding greater Mexico City. To date, only one of approximately 90 apartment compounds - the multi-family residential complexes of Teotihuacan - has been excavated. <br/><br/>Research goals of the project scale from the level of the household to the level of the urbanization of the city as a whole. One household activity of particular interest is the production of obsidian blades - the utilitarian cutting implement of the period - in one compound, and its implications for the organization of markets and interregional exchange. This compound will be excavated and the obsidian acquisition, production, and distribution system will be analyzed technologically and geochemically. At the district level, a complex consisting of likely temples around a plaza will be studied for a better understanding of administrative and religious activities that connected neighborhoods and articulated them with the urban fabric of the multi-ethnic city. And at the level of the entire city, excavations at the unexplored southern Street of the Dead will address when it was established and the degree of centralization involved in this major act of urban planning. <br/><br/>Research methods of the project include two seasons of horizontal excavations at three compounds and along the southern Street of the Dead; analysis of activity areas coupling floor-chemistry analyses and micromorphological studies; detailed materials analyses, including the technological sequence of obsidian-blade production; isotopic analysis of bones and geochemical analyses of artifacts; and extensive surface mapping and remote-sensing programs for neighborhood-scale spatial analyses.

The catalytic activity of these enzymes is regulated at two levels: first, through conformational transitions occurring on the catalytic timescale allowing the enzyme to attain a state capable of RNA polymerization; second, through regulatory interactions with other proteins in the context of a multi-protein RNA polymerase complex. The proposed research, through a combination of biophysical/structural studies and biochemical/functional assays, will elucidate the nature and importance of these two levels of regulation in a bacteriophage RdRp. The multidisciplinary nature of the research will provide training for students from various backgrounds at multiple stages of their professional preparation. These efforts will be in line with the overarching mission of the City College of New York to provide a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic research and training environment that is inclusive of groups underrepresented in the sciences including minorities and women. In order to strengthen the pipeline of students from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in the STEM disciplines, the PI will refine and expand his outreach activities to several New York area high schools including one situated in one of the poorest congressional districts in the country.<br/><br/> Biochemical studies on viral RdRps have indicated that specific conformational changes at the polymerase active site influence the rate of nucleotide addition during the elongation stage of RNA polymerization. The nature of these conformational changes remains unknown despite the availability of crystal structures of several viral RdRps. The proposed research will resolve this longstanding problem by combining solution NMR to probe dynamics on the millisecond timescale with measurements of nucleotide addition kinetics. These complimentary sources of data, NMR dynamics and fast kinetics, interpreted within the framework of the available crystal structures and others to be determined, will provide a clear structural and dynamic view of RdRp-catalyzed nucleic acid polymerization in RNA viruses. Comparison of two distantly related enzymes (from bacteriophage phi-12 and poliovirus) will allow generalization to a broad class of viral RdRps. In addition to dynamics, protein-protein interactions within polymerase complexes exert higher order control over the activity of their constituent RdRps. Modifications in these interactions lead to altered RdRp function, and in extreme cases to non-infectious viruses. The proposed studies will define these regulatory interactions in the context of phi-12 that contains a simple 4-protein polymerase complex. The results obtained will be generalizable to more complex RNA viruses.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry."

A two-year urban institution, we provide high quality liberal arts and 21st century career programs to a diverse population of Native Hawaiian (NH) and multi-ethnic students and communities. KCC bears the name of Queen Julia Kapiolani, whose motto was ""Kulia i ka nuu,""? ""To Reach for the Highest."" This motto sets the standard for the College?s vision and mission as a learning-centered institution. Likewise, it inspires the proposed TEAM-UP project as we move students progressively to more challenging science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) levels. This new TEAM-UP proposal focuses on Life Sciences that are grounded in the NH ahupuaa (ah-who-poo-ah-ah) at its center. An ahupuaa is a traditional division of land running along the banks of a stream and extending from the mountains to the sea that has been a part of the Hawaiian culture for hundreds of years. It provides an intellectual framework that serves as an excellent touch stone for NH students. This proposal also uses key ?building blocks? of NH knowledge, to contextualize the science of Hawaii?s mountain to sea ecosystems. KCC has benefited from previous NSF grants to build a strong STEM infrastructure that integrates the comprehensive, research-based, STEM Student Support and Success System proposed in this TEAM-UP project.<br/>Goals: The project has two goals: Goal 1) To implement a new STEM Learning Continuum that progressively advances NH students, including those with disabilities, in biology, ecology, biotechnology, eco-engineering, and technology; Goal 2) To implement a NH Community of Practice that connects NH students, mentors, and undergraduate researchers with faculty, researchers, and community partners. The project has ten objectives to achieve these goals, detailed in the proposal, and four major outcomes: 1) creation of a comprehensive and sustainable participant support system for 175 NH students; 2) completion of the ASNS degree in Life Sciences and/or transfer to biological science fields at UH Manoa or UH Hilo by 140 NH students; 3) completion of a STEM baccalaureate degree at UHM or UHH by 100 NH students; and 4) new partnerships with the NH community, the private sector and state government, and opportunities for competitive research in the life sciences will provide a strong foundation for future sustainability and growth of the KCC Life and Physical Sciences program."

Often, they engage in language stylization practices (Coupland 2001), or the highlighted performance of a linguistic style that diverges from the unmarked style of the speaker or context. For example, a Samoan-American who typically speaks a mainstream variety of American English might employ a mock Chinese accent. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Keith Walters and Ms. Elaine Chun will examine the use of language styles as a means of constructing specifically Asian-American and Pacific Islander American youth identities at a public high school in Texas where these groups make up a sizeable minority of an ethnically diverse student body. Of particular interest is how Asian/Pacific Americans incorporate stylization practices into their varied forms of participation in mainstream activities outside the classroom context. The youths in this study, many of whom come from multiracial and immigrant families, are particularly well-positioned to engage in creative stylization practices by drawing from both in-school and out-of-school linguistic resources. While acknowledging the variability within and across the study's various Asian/Pacific American groups, the investigators are also concerned with how members of these groups come to be constructed and construct themselves as an ethnic minority in the U.S. context. Through ethnographic methods of data collection, including three semesters of full-time, daily participant observation, fieldnotes, interviews, and audio- and video-recordings, this study will illuminate the ways in which micro-level language practices relate to students' identities and their local ideologies about language, social identity, and school participation. A discourse-centered analysis of the recorded and transcribed data will tease apart the complex ideologies of race, ethnicity, nation, gender, sexuality, and class that are linked to students' symbolic practices.<br/><br/>This dissertation project will be significant for research in sociolinguistics and Asian/Pacific American studies. It contributes to linguists' understanding of how and why individual speakers move between various styles, and sometimes symbolically across ethnic boundaries, as well as how adolescents learn language ideologies that link particular styles with particular kinds of people. Asian/Pacific Americans have rarely been the focus of linguistics research. This research project will bring attention to a marginalized and particularly complex Asian/Pacific American community in a Texas military town. The project's broader social impact derives from its challenge to popular discourses in the U.S. that perpetuate stereotypical images of Asians and Pacific Islanders. In addition, the in-depth investigation of students' language practices and beliefs in the context of mainstream school activities will benefit policymakers and educators who seek to understand the various ways in which students in immigrant communities accept, negotiate, and benefit from these activities."

She will examine the extent to which the Chinese nationals use the language resources associated with Singapore, that is, Singaporean English and Mandarin, to index multiple identities within the Singaporean society and within a broader transnational Chinese context. Besides examining patterns of language mixing, she will also study patterns in the use of specific phonological and lexical features across a range of styles and social contexts, as well as discursive data comprising speakers' ideologies regarding language and identity. Lee will combine ethnographic observations of speakers' language behaviors across a range of situations and contexts with metalinguistic data recorded from participants' self-recordings and from one-on-one and group interviews.<br/><br/>This project contributes to an understanding within linguistics and linguistic anthropology of how patterns of language use can be linked to multiple layers of identity, specifically where the forces of influence are both local and transnational. On a larger scale, the project also contributes to a growing interest among anthropologists, economists, and sociologists in studying the ways in which new migration patterns have allowed strong economic, cultural and emotional ties to be maintained between migrants and their sending countries."

The project compares urban land use disputes in Paris, France, with similar disputes in New York City. In New York City, where research is complete, Newman found that a social movement to improve a section of the city gained momentum and influence only when the neighborhood gentrified and the movement became more white and middle-class. Thus increasing democraticization of city planning was associated with marginalization of the poor and powerless. This award is to support the comparative French phase of the project.<br/><br/>This project is a case study of a social movement that arose in the multi-ethnic northern outskirts of Paris. The movement demanded that the city build a park over an abandoned industrial site. The movement was successful, but, as in New York City, the success was concurrent with the gentrification of the surrounding area. Historically, the district has been home to working class residents, many of them residents of Maghrebi and of West African descent. The researcher will do participant observation and ethnographic interviews with activists and residents to investigate social, political, and economic transformation in the neighborhood. In addition, he will interview local experts, including municipal authorities, architects, and those who chose the park design.<br/><br/>The research will compare how urban redevelopment occurs and is contested in these two post-industrial, globalized societies with differing urban and social policy, differing histories of immigration and racial politics, but similar experience with recent rebuilding and reinvestment in low-income urban areas. It will contribute to research on the intertwined social, economic, and political transformations of contemporary cities. Through collaborations with researchers in France, the project also aims to build a bridge between French and American anthropology and urban research. In addition to its academic contribution, the results of this project are intended to be informative for urban planners, urban policymakers, and community leaders in both France and the United States."

For some groups of people, globally oriented economic activity has created new opportunities; for others, the forces of change have been adverse. In nearly every case, changing economic systems have been accompanied by changes in the social, cultural, and political milieu within which the groups have operated. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the resiliency and change in a Miskitu logging village in the North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN) of Nicaragua as it engages in increasing rates of harvesting for the global lumber market. While Nicaragua has some of the most advanced indigenous self-determination legislation in the Americas, violations of cultural and land rights remain commonplace due to the institutional, economic, ecological, and political landscape. As in numerous other locations, increasing multinational extraction and processes of political decentralization have resulted in extensive shifts in socially and politically constructed identities at multiple scales. This research will investigate the structure and function of municipal, regional, national, and global institutions that influence lumber extraction from the village of Alamikamba. At the core of this investigation will be the village Elder Council, a traditional but dynamic institution for resource management. Some local actors recently became conduits through which multinational companies expand forest extraction from communal indigenous land, while other community members opposed these same forces. While sensitive to heterogeneity within Alamikamba, this study questions prevailing academic assumptions that decentralized decision making inherently fosters empowerment and local control. To achieve this goal, this project will combine archival, survey, interview, ethnographic (field walks, oral histories, participant observation), and community mapping methods.<br/><br/>Documentation of the Elder Council and wider village decision-making processes will amplify understanding of indigenous self-governance and community-based forest management, including the administration of common property land and resources. The comparison of Nicaragua with other decentralizing, multiethnic countries in the hemisphere, such as Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Mexico, and Panama, will provide valuable contributions to development and resource management theory. Through the examination of a village on the forest extraction frontier, which is similar to many other internal colonization fronts in Latin America, the research will demonstrate processes of transition in decision-making, power, and governance that broadly influence the local ecology and indigenous cultures. By analyzing the devolution of environmental management authority, this project will further strengthen networks between geography and related fields such as political science, policy studies, development studies, and rural sociology. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

The seminar will bring together social scientists and policy experts from the United States and Guatemala, to present research and analyses of the trajectory of Guatemalan social change in its comparative regional and global context. The main purpose is to further policy-relevant social scientific research on the issues of Guatemalan economic development and democratization in the context of changing global constraints and opportunities. Researchers will evaluate a range of proactive responses to forces that should be considered by participants from all sectors of Guatemalan society, as well as by those abroad who are interested in facilitating Guatemalan democracy and development. Guatemala is the largest country in Central America, and the last to negotiate an end to civil war. The peace process has created an important moment in Guatemalan history. Formerly excluded groups are becoming participants in legal and institutional processes for formulating policies of development and democratization. While the process still has a long way to go before Guatemala can be considered a full-fledged member of the family of democratic nations, the direction of recent developments is clear. The prospect of a new multiethnic nation that recognizes the cultural, political and economic rights of its poorest and least powerful citizens is a real possibility for the first time in decades. The focus of the seminar will be on the most salient problems and their potential solutions during the next two decades. The dissemination of the results will help social scientists share perspectives and formulate research strategies that are relevant for policies that can contribute to resolving the emergent problems in post-war Guatemala. ***"

The research will first document the development and structure of the Chinese banks in the Los Angeles area. Second, it will examine how these banks have facilitated the development of ethnic communities, especially in terms of altering commercial infrastructure and residential landscapes in the eastern suburban San Gabriel Valley. Third, it will explore the transnational ties and the roles of Chinese banks in the globalization process. Planned activities include a joint event, involving representatives from academia, the banking sector, community, and government. This roundtable discussion will address research results, banking experiences locally and across national boundaries, the dialogue among bankers, community leaders, and public officials in terms of community needs, banking regulatory issues, and public policies. The project aims to contribute to our comprehension of the changing dynamics in American suburbs, in order to foster mutual understanding between minority banks and mainstream society, and to provide policy suggestions concerning banking and community development. On the theoretical level, the work will examine the trajectory and structure of a particular minority-banking sector from a geographical perspective, and to contribute to the ""Geography of Money and Finance."" On the methodological front, the project will utilize multiple data sources and multi-faceted analyses, while combining quantitative and qualitative methods. It will test the validity of bank data collection for geographical research and the utility of qualitative research in banking analysis, notably interview and participatory methods. The analyses of publicly available data sources such as FDIC and HMDA, on the other hand, will yield a replicable method that can be applied to the study of other groups and localities. Also it will broaden the impacts through interdisciplinary connections, cross-university and multinational collaborations, and academic, banking, community, and public sector cooperation. There may be implications for changes in banking regulation and public policy within the study area in particular and within multiethnic urban America in general. The project will have a number of outcomes. It will begin with papers delivered at academic conferences at regional, national, and international levels, followed by research articles submitted to scholarly journals, both geography and interdisciplinary, chapter(s) in an edited volume on ethnic banking in Southern California, and a research report made available for all interested parties. Finally, there will be an opinion article targeted at the general public and a videotape clip to be circulated to both Chinese and mainstream mass media, in order to draw attention to the issues of minority banks and community development.

Teachers were asked to become more sensitive to the speech style differences of their minority students. Educational reform initiatives applied the findings from sociolinguistic research on cross-cultural and multi-ethnic classroom settings and broadened participation structures to create educational equity among diverse groups. Similar sociolinguistic assumptions can be found driving the current reform of mathematics education led by the National council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM. The NCTM standards emphasize communication skills so that all students can become mathematically literate. This study focuses on how the NCTM standards attempt to achieve educational equity through a prescribed restructuring of classroom communication and discourse patterns. However, critics of the sociolinguistic approach to educational equity have argued that broader socioeconomic and racial issues prevent some minorities more than others from full participation in school. This study follows a dual course. Using a sociolinguistic framework, it approaches language usage within the immediate setting of the mathematics classroom. Using an ethnographic framework, it examines the broader historical, political, and economic contexts within which the classroom and its students are situated. A comprehensive sociolinguistic model of elementary school mathematics discourse will be constructed which will expand the anthropological and sociolinguistic notions of context of situation and functions of language. In addition, this study will address what educators, teachers, and taxpayers need to know about a.)the cultural and linguistic diversities of students, b.)the underlying sociolinguistic assumptions used by the NCTM standards, c.)the feasibility of the NCTM national mathematics standards, and d.)the efficacy of national educational reforms that aim to achieve educational by relying on strategies to restructure classroom communication and discourse patterns."

The research will be carried out in a Malay Muslim village in the southernmost region of Thailand. A predominantly Malay Muslim area within the Thai Buddhist state, the region has witnessed multiple rounds of insurgency. The current insurgency, which dates from 2004, has brought ordinary Malay Muslims to the forefront. They not only account for the majority of casualties, but they also have been drawn into new questions of identity and allegiance. This situation provides an excellent site for investigating how citizens, in this case from a minority population, negotiate identity and allegiance in relation to the nation.<br/><br/>The researcher will focus on how Malay Muslims experience and explain the current insurgency; how questions of identity and allegiance are raised in the contexts of everyday life, state encounters, and civic engagements; and how Malay Muslims seek and enact agency by engaging with various forms of sovereignty. The researcher will collect data with a variety of social science methods, including: participant observation of daily life and livelihood under conditions of unrest; semi-structured and informal interviews; content analyses of school curriculum and interviews with school representatives; travel with and observation of the routines of government representatives; and content analyses of religious media and interviews with religious representatives.<br/><br/>The research is important because the situation experienced by the Malay Muslims parallels that experienced by many minorities under conditions of changing notions of the role of government. Thus the research will contribute to social science theory. The research also will document the lives of an understudied Mulsim minority population in an area of the world of increasing political importance. Finally, this award contributes to the education of a social scientist."

Urban reconstruction is therefore shaped by struggles between centralization and decentralization, elite and subordinate groups, global and local economics.

Bruce Dahlin and Traci Arden will conduct three seasons of research at the archaeological site of Chunchucmil located in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Dating to the Classic Maya period, the site is an enigma and unique among its contemporaries. Although it is extremely large with a center encompassing ca. 45 ha, it is remarkably drab and lacks the hallmarks of a major Mayan settlement. The site center lacks easily recognizable civic and public religious architecture. Missing are the obvious structures such as elaborate and conspicuous acropolises and palace complexes which would suggest administrative functions or focal temple pyramids which would serve to enhance sacred power. The site center also lacks typical Classic Mayan period sculpture, carved and inscribed stelae, altars, lintels and other trappings of traditional Mayan hierarchy. Dahlin and Arden believe that because of the site's location near the Gulf Coast (an active late prehistoric and early historic commerce route,) it may have served as a trading center with enclaves of merchants from various Mayan groups and regulated commerce both along the coast and inland. They and their collaborators have conducted preliminary mapping and survey at the site and will now follow up with a major field initiative. In addition to gathering basic temporal and spatial data, the program includes mapping and survey, midden testing, intensive excavation and paleoecological work. The central 6 km sq. and four 10 km long cruciform transects will be mapped. The team will excavate a stratified random sampling program of residential units, specialized production areas, possible marketplaces and possible civic areas. Paleoecological work will include soil analysis and flotation of screened midden materials for macrobotanical remains, pollen and phytoliths. Laboratory analyses will include analyses of ceramics and the search for starch residues on grinding stones which will provide dietary insight.<br/><br/>While considerable archaeological research has focused on individual Mayan sites and many small scale regional systems have been reconstructed, scientists do not understand the extent to which these individual units were bound together and interacted during the height of Mayan civilization. In the following Post Classic period extensive trade networks existed but none have been identified during the preceding Classic. If Dr. Dahlin's and Adren in their hypothesis that Chunchucmil was a multi-ethnic trade center, this will provide important insight into how Mayan society functioned."

The basic issues to be examined are the sources of control over the content of the music. Methods include ethnographic participant observation of several studios in Johannesburg; recording and transcription of the work in progress, open ended interviews with participants, observation of talent scouting trips into the rural areas, and observation of live performances. The power of popular music to define the cultural position of people in their society is striking throughout the world. Understanding how the cultural content of music gets produced in this particular case (as more or less traditional in a context where tradition is related to race in a complex way) can aid understanding of the function of music in multi-ethnic society in general."

Much of this growth has occurred in rural areas that have transformed rapidly from historically biracial to multi-ethnic communities. North Carolina, with the highest Latino growth rate among all U.S. states over the past decade, provides a unique opportunity to analyze ""early stage"" migration and settlement processes. Project research objectives include: 1) Identify how key micro and macro factors have shaped the migration and settlement of Latinos in the rural South; 2) Explain how Latino migration and settlement in the rural South has restructured economic, social and racial/ethnic relations in both origin and destination communities; 3) Analyze the transnational networks and relations Latinos construct over time and space linking them to homeland place of origin, U.S. gateway cities and new rural home communities in the South; and 4) Identify the most effective approaches to building new community and economic development initiatives that incorporate Latinos. The geographic focus of this multi-sited project includes three rural eastern N.C. communities, neighboring cities of the east and a town in the Tierra Caliente region of Michoacan (Mexico) with strong transnational ties to eastern N.C. This project will take a theoretically eclectic approach including multi-level analysis, gender analysis, inter-group relations and transnational paradigms. The research will employ a ""mixed method"" approach including: 1) Qualitative Interviews with Latino Families and Non-Latino residents in N.C. Rural Communities and with Key Informants; 2) Quantitative eastern N.C. Survey of Non-Latino Resident Attitudes and Perceptions of Latino Migration and Settlement; and 3) ""Michoacarolina"" Transnational Case Study in collaboration with the Mexican Migration Project (MMP).<br/><br/>Through an integrated program of research, education and outreach, this project seeks to make a significant contribution to the growing academic literature on the new geography of Latino migration, particularly to rural areas in the South; to develop urgently needed curricula that will integrate migration studies into various ECU academic programs; to mentor and support minority graduate students specializing in migration; and to provide outreach that will improve service delivery for initiatives targeting Latino communities."

The focus of Canas' research will be Mayan women converts in Chiapas and the relation between their conversion and their struggles for land entitling. The research is important because religious conversion under conditions of socioeconomic stress is known to be a worldwide phenomenon, but the conversion of indigenous people to Islam in Latin America is a more recent and less well-understood development.<br/><br/>For more than 10 years, indigenous Muslims in Chiapas, along with other indigenous people, have struggled to regularize their use of urban lands, which they occupied after being forced off rural agricultural land. Preliminary resarch has found that women have actively participated in the land regularization struggle, and some use Islam as a resource to do so. At the same time they show increasing interest in learning about their new religion, in discussing the sacred texts, and in attempting to selectively incorporate Islamic tradition into their daily lives and their changing understandings of citizenship and nation. <br/><br/>The investigator will undertake 12 months of anthropological field research in Chiapas. She will conduct household surveys, carry out extended participant observation, do unstructured interviews, and explore archival resources. Her overarching research goals are to: (a) explore religious conversion, gender dynamics, and citizenship among Mayans Muslims in Southern Mexico; and (b) analyze the relationship between conversion processes and social mobilization. <br/><br/>Ethnographically grounded research on new Muslim communities is important for deepening our understanding of conversion processes within globalized and multiethnic environments. This is especially the case for Latin America, where almost no research has been done on conversion to Islam."

But neither parents nor scientists know how long an infant will look at a given face or object. This study tests the hypothesis that the durations of an infant's previous looks at a target predict the duration of the next look at the target. This is called the temporal dependency hypothesis. It suggests that infants regulate their own behavior to learn from their environment early in life. The temporal dependency hypothesis will be evaluated in a multi-ethnic group of infants from the Southeastern United States. During several visits in the first year of life, individual infant looks will be measured as infants interact with their mothers, and watch videos of people and objects. During each of these activities, individual infants may have a preferred level of temporal dependency that indicates how strongly their past looks predict their next looks. Greater temporal dependency is believed to reflect greater self-regulation. The project will assess whether greater temporal dependency predicts higher levels of communication and self-regulation at a year and a half of age.<br/><br/>The project unites research on social and cognitive development to understand the behavioral bases of visual exploration. It tests a hypothesis that may characterize other behaviors relevant to children's learning such as reaction times. Results will inform understanding of developmental disorders such as autism, and the development of new technologies such as robots with realistic and effective looking behaviors. To maximize this impact, project resources such as digital recordings of infant behavior will be shared with other researchers."

Gibson and James D. Long<br/><br/>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: How do Voters Decide? Ethnicity and Performance in African Elections<br/><br/>0718782<br/><br/>Abstract<br/>On what bases do African citizens choose leaders in democratic elections? African elections are typically understood as highly ethnic, where candidates appeal to voters by inciting ethnic fear or using selective incentives such as patronage to attract support from co-ethnics. The study advances our understanding of African voting behavior by identifying when, where and in what ways ethnicity and performance matter, either separately or in conjunction. Consequently, this will demonstrate whether politicians pursue policies, goods, and services directed at their own ethnic group or more broadly to the district or nation. If ethnic hypotheses are correct, co-ethnics will be returned to office time and again and narrowly target policies towards their group. If performance hypotheses are correct, poor performers will be thrown out of office and politicians will be encouraged to pursue policies targeted towards co-ethnics and non-ethnics alike.<br/>In order to understand whether and how ethnicity and performance matter to voting, this study proposes a post-election survey of Kenya's upcoming December 2007 election. It will consist of randomly chosen voters from precincts in a nationally representative sample. The survey will ask questions regarding ethnicity, evaluations of performance, and vote choice for candidates in local and national elections. <br/>The study makes empirical and methodological improvements upon current studies by using novel individual level survey data. Rather than postulate the effects of ethnicity or performance at the group level, the survey allows for robust and direct tests of these variables in determining an individual's vote. Performing the study for local and national elections allows for separate tests using different electoral units that vary over a number of characteristics. It provides a better measure of performance than extant studies, understood as the delivery of local public services that result from taxation. Through randomization, the survey also avoids problems of selection bias that plague other studies. Such data will allow me to test separate hypotheses concerning the independent effects of ethnicity and performance, as well as the ways in which the two interact. <br/>The broader impact of this project has important implications for development in multi-ethnic and poor countries. The results of this study can provide politicians, policymakers and donors with critical information regarding the relationship between citizens and leaders over issues of ethnicity, performance, public services, and taxation. If performance theories are correct, elections are the prime mechanism that induces accountability on the part of politicians. These policies may in turn become the engine to sustained economic growth and development. If ethnic theories are correct, we might expect skewed policy biases that are harmful for progress over the long-run. This is especially true at the local level, where scholars and policymakers increasingly view local government as the potential catalyst for development."

Genomes of admixed individuals can be modeled as mosaics of chromosomal tracts that originate from a finite number of ancestors and populations. Current models of admixture are limited by simplifying assumptions regarding the amount, duration, or direction of the admixture process and fail to accurately predict patterns of genetic variation observed in real data. To redress this issue, the investigators propose a family of higher order Markovian models and coalescent approaches that provide much greater flexibility. AIM 2: To develop statistical inference tools for estimating historical admixture. This project will improve upon existing methods for robustly inferring the population of origin of chromosomal segments in admixed genomes. Given the distribution of ''admixture tracts'', one then wishes to model the recent demographic history of the population. The investigators will use the results of Aims 1 and 2 along with a growing database in the investigator's lab on genomic variation in the Americas to provide detailed models of admixture that can empower medical and association studies in the Americas. AIM 3: To develop a Linkage/Admixture Map of Hispanic/Latino populations. Recently, it was shown that motifs associated with population specific alleles at the PRDM9 locus account for a significant fraction of recombination rate variation among populations. The investigators propose analyzing data from more than 20,000 genetically and ethnically diverse U.S. participants across at least 2.5 million markers to identify population-specific recombination hotspots and their relationship with ancestry. Specifically, the investigators aim to identify Native-American specific recombination hotspots and produce the highest-resolution recombination map of the human genome to date.<br/><br/>Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have dramatically increased the scientific community's understanding of the genetic basis of complex disease by identifying thousands of genetic variants associated with chronic diseases including Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and many cancers. A key limitation of existing studies is that they have focused largely on participants of European descent and some of these genotype/phenotype associations do not readily translate from one ethnic group to another. Furthermore, since the next generation of studies will focus largely on querying rare genetic variants (i.e., <5% frequency) for association, this ''transferability problem'' is likely to get worse and risks perpetuating or even widening existing health disparity among ethnic groups in the U.S. Broadening representation in medical genomics studies is a key mechanism for redressing these biases. Critical to enabling trans- and multi-ethnic medical genetic studies is a rigorous understanding of how 500 years of admixture among diverse European, African, and indigenous American source populations have shaped the genomes of African-American, Hispanic/Latinos, and Native Americans today. A key outcome of this research will be user-friendly software that implements a comprehensive, probabilistic, and flexible family of methods for inferring genetic ancestry. The investigators will train undergraduate, high school, community college, graduate, and post-doctoral students including many from underrepresented minority groups. Project results will be disseminated to the public through the San Jose Tech Museum and participation in conferences aimed at minority groups including SACNAS and the National Urban League. Partnerships with key industry leaders will allow us to reach potentially millions of participants."

The unifying theme for the IQIM is the exploration of collective quantum phenomena that endow physical systems of many interacting constituents with astonishing properties that in effect transform the weirdness of the microscopic quantum realm to macroscopic scales. The principal motivations for the creation of the IQIM are the extraordinary set of scientific opportunities associated with the study of exotic quantum states of matter and the potential for discovery brought by newly developed tools from Quantum Information Science. The IQIM ties together the diverse Caltech community of researchers, from physics to applied physics, to computer science, who focus on emergent quantum phenomena and provides a sustaining base for the scientific development of a new field of research that will actively involve national and international communities of researchers in QIS, CMP, AMOP, and MQS. By way of extensive programs in education and outreach, the IQIM will impact high school and college education and will engage the general public with the ""mind boggling"" nature of the quantum realm.<br/><br/>It has long been known that individual atoms and electrons, as well as electromagnetic and mechanical oscillators (i.e., photons and phonons), obey laws of quantum physics that in many respects defy common sense. Under the right conditions, interactions among many such quantum objects can lead to remarkable quantum phenomena that have heretofore not existed in nature. Advances to create, characterize, and utilize such exotic quantum phenomena have been made in condensed matter physics (CMP), atomic-molecular-optical physics (AMOP), and at the interface between these areas. In conjunction with parallel developments in quantum information science (QIS), a revolution is underway in the study of exotic quantum systems that is the unifying theme and driving motivation for the IQIM. Progress in the experimental realization and theoretical understanding in this area will surely have profound implications for basic physics. The IQIM will merge insights and analytic tools from QIS with advancing laboratory capabilities in CMP, AMOP, and MQS for the discovery and characterization of exotic quantum states of matter, and will thereby shed light on issues at the core of physics. Eventually, the ability to manipulate exotic quantum systems may lead to new technological capabilities, including methods for designing and exploiting quantum materials.<br/><br/>The Institute for Quantum Information and Matter will have the following scientific thrusts:<br/><br/>Quantum Information: Investigators at the current NSF-sponsored Institute for Quantum Information (IQI) have made Caltech a recognized world leader in theoretical QIS. IQI faculty are integral members of the IQIM and conduct research that is closely allied to the IQIM, e.g., the application of topological principles to quantum phase transitions and the discovery of universal features of entanglement that that distinguish quantum phases of matter. Research at the IQIM includes investigations of the connections between quantum information science and other aspects of basic physics. IQI scientists will lead the quest to apply insights into the properties of quantum entanglement for the study of quantum many-body systems and quantum phase transitions, as well as to apply quantum information theory to illuminate how information is encoded in spacetimes subject to strong quantum fluctuations. The IQI will also continue its world leading programs on quantum computation and communication.<br/><br/>Quantum Many-Body Physics: Caltech has world leading programs in the quantum physics of strongly interacting many-body systems (e.g., superconductors, exotic magnets, strongly correlated electron systems, etc.). Research thrusts in this area will emphasize emergent quantum phenomena, including quantum Hall physics, topological states of matter, exotic magnetic systems, and ultra-cold atomic gases, and with strong connections to powerful theoretical techniques from QIS. These studies will involve some of the most fascinating and puzzling manifestations of many-body quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>Quantum Optics: Another area of great strength at Caltech is the study of optical interactions at the level of one atom and photon, where seminal advances in the realization of new paradigms for light-matter interactions by way of micro- and nano-scopic optical cavities have been made. Within IQIM, existing capabilities for quantum control of strong interactions of single atoms and photons will be extended to explore quantum many-body systems composed of 1- and 2-D arrays of atoms whose interactions are mediated by photons in microscopic quantum optical circuits.<br/><br/>Quantum Mechanics of Mechanical Systems: Faculty in the IQIM in will build upon recent advances in opto- and electro-mechanics 1) to achieve quantum control of single phonons in simple material systems, thereby enabling lithographic fabrication of quantum many-body systems with phonon mediated interactions, and 2) to create human-sized objects in entangled quantum states within the setting of LIGO.<br/><br/>The IQIM has many facets beyond fundamental research to explore exotic quantum states of matter and the interface with QIS. With the end of scalability of conventional silicon-based information technology on the horizon, it is vitally important to explore aggressively new paradigms for information technology. By attracting and training top students and postdoctoral scholars in QIS, CMP, AMOP, and MQS, the IQIM will significantly strengthen the US presence in these areas and will broaden the nation's technical base. A particularly important aspect of the IQIM?s broader impact is a vibrant visitor program, which fuels intellectual excitement, facilitates collaborations and exchanges of scientific ideas, and performs a highly valued service for national and international communities at the interfaces of QIS, CMP, AMOP, and MQS. <br/><br/>The IQIM will also undertake extensive programs for outreach and the development of human resources. The goal is to use the public's fascination with the mysteries of the quantum realm to engage a broad community in basic science and education. Activities include the following:<br/>The Caltech Precollege Science Initiative (CAPSI )- In collaboration with CAPSI, IQIM will develop high school curricula for one to two week instructional modules related to the scientific activities of the Institute, <br/>Summer internships for high school teachers and students from multiethnic LA regional high schools,<br/>Caltech MURF program for undergraduate research experience of minority students in IQIM laboratories,<br/>Disseminating science via a science and entertainment partnership in collaboration with The Science and Entertainment Exchange (SEE),<br/>Development of university curricula related to IQIM fields of research,<br/>Public presentations via the Caltech Watson Lectures and YouTube videos.<br/><br/>These activities will be accessible via an interactive IQIM website.<br/><br/>Funding is provided by the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering."

Judith Habicht-Mauche at University of California, Santa Cruz and Andrew Duff at Washington State University examines ceramic technological practices and resources used to explore how emergent social networks enhanced the flow of information, material and people in the late precontact Southwest, transforming communities and identities in ways that continue to have relevance today. The Pueblo IV period (A.D. 1275-1400) was marked by a series of demographic upheavals that resulted in the formation of radically reconfigured social landscapes. The depopulation of long-occupied and densely settled regions instigated migrations that led to the displacement and reorganization of local communities and regional social networks. In areas that received a significant influx of new population, people from diverse ethnic, linguistic and cultural backgrounds came together to remake their social worlds. On the one hand, the Pueblo IV period appears to be a unique event in Pueblo history that led to many of the social formations and cultural identities that characterized the Southwest at European contact and that have largely endured to the present day. On the other hand, it is only one moment in a cycle of demographic reorganization and social negotiation that has characterized Pueblo societies from the beginnings of agricultural village life. The nature of Pueblo IV period reorganization,both what made it historically and structurally unique and what linked it to cycles of movement and culture change in the Southwest,remains a topic of central importance and anthropological inquiry. Archaeologists investigating this time period are interested in tracing migrant populations, in understanding how migrants merged with local groups to form multi-ethnic communities, in modeling how new social identities were negotiated and sustained, in documenting the emergence of novel social institutions and ritual practices and in understanding emergent systems of leadership and power. Data collected during this project will identify intra- and inter-regional trajectories of ceramic technological innovation and transfers of knowledge that illuminate subtle and complex interconnections among past and present populations. These connections trace both contact and movement of people, which have implications for contemporary Native American groups and public policy.<br/><br/>Habicht-Mauche and Duff will mobilize a variety of analytical techniques to characterize local ""recipes"" and sources of raw materials used to prepare glaze paints on pottery manufactured at Pueblo IV period sites in east-central Arizona and west-central New Mexico. The project will chemically characterize glaze-paint composition using LA-ICP-MS and isotopically source lead in glaze paint using dissolution ICP-MS. These data will be integrated with other extant regional glaze-paint databases. Relationships among composition and source will be evaluated using Social Network Analysis. Thus, data from this project will contribute to emerging macroregional models of how late precontact social networks facilitated the exchange of technical information and materials, created and sustained migration corridors, and served as arenas of social reproduction that transformed Pueblo society. This project will enhance understanding of the cultural history of the Native peoples of the Southwest, while also making broader intellectual contributions to anthropological studies of migration and the anthropology of technology."

In particular, there are a number of reasons why it should matter whether party systems are organized along ethnic versus non-ethnic lines, beyond simply that the issues of political debate are different. These include possible links between ethnic parties and patronage politics, democratic instability, and ethnic violence. The more we know about what .causes. ethnically-based party systems, the better position we are in to design institutions and other policy interventions that prevent their dangers. Building on recent .materialist. literature in ethnic politics, this dissertation thus asks: When and why are ethnic identities politically salient in the party systems of some new democracies and economic identities in others? When are both or neither salient? This project seeks to develop an answer to these questions that applies cross-nationally, specifically to new multiethnic democracies. <br/>Methods: This project employs both in-depth fieldwork in two geographic regions and cross-national statistical analysis. Fieldwork in Benin and Bolivia during the 2004-2005 academic year will be used to test the causal mechanisms of the theory presented against those of other theories drawn from the literature using within-country comparisons over time and across regions. Benin and Bolivia were carefully chosen using a .best case. strategy; if the working theory does not hold for these cases, it should be rejected. Data will be drawn from elite interviews; ethnographic observation of election campaigns, political rallies, and other events; and census, electoral, and survey data. Other methods, such as content analysis of local newspaper articles and parliamentary debates also may be used. The cross-national component of the project will be used to explore the external validity of the findings drawn from the cases by testing key predictions. Data for this analysis will be drawn from a new cross-national dataset on political parties, which builds on Professor Kanchan Chandra.s Cross-National Database on Ethnic Parties, as well as other cross-national sources. During the term of the proposed activity, six months of field work would be conducted in each case study country, in Bolivia during September 2004 to February 2005 and in Benin during March through August 2005. Cross-national analysis will be completed during spring 2004 and fall 2005.<br/> Broader Impacts: The proposed NSF grant would fund the field research component of a doctoral dissertation in political science at MIT, thus promoting training and learning. The dissertation is scheduled to be completed by June 2006, following which the co-PI of this project will pursue a teaching career. The results of the proposed activity will be broadly disseminated. They will be presented at professional academic conferences (some proposals have already been submitted); disseminated through colloquia or working papers; and submitted in article form for journal publication. The entire dissertation will form the basis of a book manuscript. The proposed activity also has the benefit of building research networks and partnerships between American scholars and those in Bolivia and Benin through the co-PI.s continuing participation as an affiliated scholar of the Universidad de la Cordillera in La Paz, Bolivia, and the Institute for Empirical Research in Political Economy (IERPE) in Cotonou, Benin. Existing networks between American scholars and those in Benin and elsewhere in francophone West Africa, in particular, are weak. Finally, in explaining why some party systems are ethnic, this project seeks to inform policy interventions and institutional reforms that promote peace, good governance, and economic well-being in democratizing countries."

Archaeology can provide a valuable window to understanding how different cultures interact since it can take a long range perspective and follow such processes often over century long time scales. The presence of biological data in the form of skeletal remains adds an additional dimension to the study. Similar interactions are visible today in multiple regions of the world.<br/><br/>With the support of the National Science Foundation, an international team, led by Dr. Stuart Tyson Smith and Dr. Michele Buzon, along with other specialists, students, and local community members will conduct a bioarchaeological research project to investigate the impact of the Egypt's New Kingdom Empire (c. 1500-1050 BC) on the Nubian Kerma Culture at the Third Cataract of the Nile River in Upper Nubia. This project builds on previous excavations at Tombos, which have documented a multi-ethnic colonial community of immigrant Egyptians and local Nubians. Excavation will include burials in the elite pyramid field of the cemetery and the previously unexplored settlement. In addition, a settlement (Hannek) and cemetery (Akkad) associated with the local Nubian Kerma culture will be explored in order to allow for a comparison of Egyptian imperial impacts on the health and identity before and after the conquest and colonization of the area. Moving beyond traditional unidirectional models of colonial encounters, this research considers the actions of both the local and foreign groups.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is the contribution to larger archaeological and anthropological research questions regarding the process of inter-cultural interactions, colonialism, and the cultural entanglements that result. Older acculturation models based upon a notion of dominant core and subordinate periphery have increasingly been replaced with more nuanced interaction based models like the one proposed here. This project will add an important case study from one of the world's earliest primary states that will be of relevance to scholars studying similar dynamics in different places and periods. The use of a multi-disciplinary bioarchaeological approach allows for a holistic examination of these issues through use of various types of data including material culture, social practices, biological relationships, geographic origins, and indications of health and disease. Tombos? unique historical context offers significant potential to shed light on the still largely unknown local impacts of the Egyptian empire, providing important data on the local people who played a role in the adoption, adaptation, and rejection of different cultural traits, as well as the interpenetration of Nubian and Egyptian features in both societies. <br/><br/>Further broader impacts of this project include the training of American and Sudanese students and researchers as well as promotion of international research collaboration. The excavation and curation of human skeletal remains from the project will provide secure storage of important archaeological and bioarchaeological data and collections as well as ensure the opportunity for future research on the material. The data produced from the proposed research will be widely disseminated in order to provide access for other researchers. Finally, this project will assist the people of Sudan in documenting the rapidly disappearing evidence of ancient Nubian life and culture resulting from settlement and cultivation. The proposed construction of a dam only ten kilometers downstream from Tombos would also heavily impact the sites and adds additional urgency to this project."

This research will use a comparative, cross-cultural design to clarify whether these behaviors are similar, have the same consequences for children, and pose the same challenges to parents and teachers, in different countries. This has significant implications for child learning and development in cross-cultural circumstances, whether in multi-ethnic classrooms in the U.S. or internationally. It also has implications for conditions in which children's behavior becomes classified as problem behavior, and how interventions for these behaviors might be designed to promote academic and social wellbeing for children and their caregivers.<br/><br/>The comparison will be made between children in three countries: US (Texas), Mexico, and Belize. These cultural settings have been chosen because they have varying teacher and parent values about children's talkativeness and activity. Social and academic consequences of impulsive, inattentive, and hyperactive behaviors will be compared across these settings. Children's behavior will be assessed at home, in the classroom and on the playground, using a combination of anthropological, biological, and psychological methods.<br/><br/>Particular attention will be paid to sex differences in behavior, because previous clinical studies have shown that severe levels of impulsive, inattentive and hyperactive behavior are much more likely to be found in boys. By using a biocultural research design, focusing on both biological and cultural contexts of the behaviors, this study will be able to clarify the roles of cultural and biological variation in producing sex differences in these behaviors. Currently, there is a poor understanding of the girls' and boys' behavior patterns, and the different reactions they may get from teachers, parents and other children. This research also has implications for children's academic and social well being, and why it may vary by sex and ethnicity. Most previous studies have focused only on pathological or extreme degrees of these behaviors, ignoring the fact that most children display these behaviors at least occasionally. Yet, even lesser degrees of impulsive, inattentive and hyperactive behavior may also have significant positive or negative consequences for many children. This study will provide the first clear evidence of the naturally occurring range of these behaviors and should be of interest to researchers in the fields of anthropology, psychology and education."

They will learn synthesis techniques, instrumentation analysis, organometallic chemistry, purification science, and problem solving strategies. In addition to acquiring laboratory skills, the Scheidt team has regular weekly full group meetings and daily sub-group gatherings to discuss prior results and chart new research directions. Weekly meetings include research presentations, short discussions on recent high-impact publications, and chemical problems for pedagogical growth. Overall, the individual training in the laboratory combined with small, medium and large group formats for presenting and discussing chemical topics provides for a rich, vibrant and dynamic learning environment. Additionally, there is strong participation by underrepresented groups in the laboratory which engenders a professional, dynamic and multi-ethnic work environment. Professor Scheidt will continue to organize and host the annual Chicago Organic Symposium as well as strengthen ties with institutions such as Western Michigan University and Chicago State University. This outreach component is centered on creating an interchange of ideas throughout the Department of Chemistry and between academic and industrial personnel from a variety of backgrounds and is expected to have a unique and significant impact on society."

MCCE (Multi Conformation Continuum Electrostatics), developed at CCNY, which combines continuum electrostatics and molecular mechanics, will be the primary method used. The novel aspect of this work is that the protonation states of protein amino acids are allowed to remain at equilibrium with the bound and free states of a charged ligand. The affinities will be calculated with MCCE, with assists from Gaussian and GROMACS. In MCCE side chain positions and protonation states, ligand positions and site occupancy and where appropriate ligand redox and protonation states are all sampled together in one Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. This project will carry out calculations of: (A) the pKas of buried charged groups, comparing the behavior of wild-type and introduced residues. pKas will be calculated for a new dataset of 100 buried charge mutations in Staphylococcal nuclease that have been determined by Garcia-Moreno (Johns Hopkins). The calculated dielectric relaxation in the mutants and wild type residues will be compared. In addition, this aspect of the project will be used to optimize methodology for calculating the changes caused by mutations. (B) The chloride affinity at different binding sites will be calculated in halorhodopsin (HR). There are structures of the homologous, proton-pumping bacteriorhodopsin (BR) trapped in different intermediate pumping states. These structures will be used as a basis to model the conformational changes that move chloride through HR. The comparison of HR and BR will focus on the nature of the gate allowing ions or protons to be pumped against a concentration gradient. (C) Kds, Ems and pKas will be calculated for quinones in the two quinone binding sites (QA and QB) of photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs). The relationship of the changes in binding affinity (Kd) and shifts in reaction free energy (ÄG°) for protonation (ÄpKa) or redox reactions (ÄEm) for bound substrates or cofactors will be investigated. The thermodynamic relationship ÄG°(reaction in protein) - ÄG°(reaction in solution) = RTln(Kd(product) -Kd(reactant)) will be used to understand previously measured Em and pKa shifts for different quinones in RCs. The affinity of a series of neutral quinones in the QA and QB sites will be calculated and compared with measured values. The aspects of the structure that favor binding different quinones to each site will be identified. The affinity of quinone and semiquinone (SQ) will be compared to find the basis of Em shifts for different quinones in the QA site or for the same quinone in the QA and QB sites.<br/><br/>This project will be carried out at CCNY, a public, city university, with an extremely diverse, multi-ethnic student body. The students to be mentored reflect this diversity. The MCCE program, which is publicly available, will be developed, distributed and maintained. Methods of calculating ligand binding and best practices for calculating pKas of mutated residues developed to carry out the work in this project will be incorporated into the distributed program. A web-based pKa databank that currently has 35,000 predicted pKas will be revamped. The physics based analysis of proteins pKas and Ems will be incorporated into an advanced, interdisciplinary biophysics class."

This colonial boundary has left an enduring political rift between the nations of Senegal and The Gambia in spite of their shared history, ethnicities, and indigenous languages. One of the major ethnolinguistic groups divided by this border is the Wolof. Although Wolof continues to be an important shared language between these countries, speakers recognize divergence in the Wolof of Senegal and The Gambia. Language is often used to construct and reinforce ethnic, social, and national identity and can evoke a strong sense of solidarity or separation among speakers. As Peter Auer has argued, not only can the national border help construct a linguistic border, but the linguistic divergence can also serve to reinforce the national border. This dissertation will focus on the border in a multiethnic, multilingual area where ethnicity is strongly associated with language.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Dr. Brian Joseph, Jane Mitsch will spend eight months in the Senegambia border areas conducting sociolinguistic interviews and ethnographic fieldwork among Wolof people. This dissertation aims to examine the linguistic practices of people with shared ethnic identity but different national identity, to explore the role of the political border in the linguistic practices of these young nations, to elicit data on different identity affinities (national, ethnic, religious etc.), and to compare the linguistic results to other linguistic studies of political borders. This study will bring linguistic input to political science questions about the strength of African nations and their borders. This research will also lead to the creation of a corpus of spoken Wolof that will capture some of the important aspects of the Wolof oral tradition such as folktales and proverbs."

This is a problem as relevant to our multiethnic world today as in the archaeological past. <br/><br/>The project focuses on determining if, when, and how migration from neighboring regions factored into local Fort Ancient developments in southwest Ohio, a long-standing problem in the prehistory of the Midwest U.S. but with methodological structure of general appeal to many world regions. The project contributes to broader issues on frontiers and cross-boundary flows that have received relatively little attention. Frontier zones at the edges of complex systems (e.g., Mississippian, Mesoamerica, Mesopotamia) have often been relegated to the status of passive receivers of culture from core areas. However, recently archaeologists have become interested in such boundary dynamics. Unlike earlier approaches, however, researchers are now addressing frontier zones as culturally rich and socially dynamic places where social actors make key decisions about long-distance interaction and new hybrid formations are often the result. <br/><br/>The theoretical focus recognizes that interregional population movements and interactions are key contributors to the blurry nature of cultural boundaries. The general anthropological significance of the project is to move interregional studies forward by focusing on data relevant to these dimensions, providing key information to then examine why such moves occurred. The key data to be gathered pertain to the proveniencing of human remains. This will be accomplished by temporally examining the strontium content of tooth enamel in a biological and mortuary framework for a sample of individuals from eleven villages. <br/><br/>The project will have broader impacts in education, both in university settings and for the general public. Undergraduate and graduate anthropology students will benefit by being trained in lab analyses, resulting in undergraduate honors and graduate level theses. Specific activities for artifact analyses will include basic examination of pottery, projectile points, gorgets, and pipes, including functional, stylistic, and temporal attributes as appropriate to the project. Specific activities for human remains will be to assist in strontium sampling. All student participants will also be mentored during a day-long career workshop in partnership with the Dayton Society of Natural History. The project will also have broader impacts in educating the general public about the types of questions that are answerable with archaeological data, and particularly the high research utility of extant museum collections. By promulgating data about these collections, the project will illustrate the importance of properly curated materials. Additionally, future research projects on the Fort Ancient collections investigated in the present study will benefit from having more solid chronological frames of reference."

This project addresses the gap in knowledge of how osmotic balance is monitored and how an organism responds to any deviation from the optimal state. Detection of a change in this critical balance by osmoreceptor cells is the first step in activating the mechanisms which ensure osmotic balance is restored and maintained. Nevertheless, our understanding of how osmoreceptor cells work has been hindered by their complex structure and arrangement among other cells in the brain, kidney and other organs. This makes it extremely difficult to develop useful experimental approaches. The prolactin cell of the tilapia solves this problem. Prolactin is an osmoregulatory hormone in tilapia, a remarkable fish that can live in fresh water and in salinities exceeding that of seawater. Unlike mammals, prolactin cells in tilapia are arranged into a nearly homogeneous mass in the pituitary gland making it easy to study how the cell is regulated. Prolactin cells have been shown to function as osmoreceptors that respond directly to osmotic changes by altering prolactin secretion which restores osmotic balance. An increase in cell size is the trigger that activates cell mechanisms that increase prolactin secretion. This project will investigate how cell size controls the activity/expression of the gene that encodes prolactin. It is anticipated that this work will increase the fundamental understanding of how osmoreceptor cells work in an economically important food fish grown in fresh water and seawater. <br/><br/>This project will allow the recruitment, education, and training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, including those of under-represented minorities from within our multi-ethnic, culturally diverse, University and area schools.

Their consequences for government stability and for peaceful management of political conflicts are important determinants of the survival of new democracies. This investigation undertakes a comparative study of constitutional designs and electoral systems in the emerging democracies of Sub-Saharan Africa. The study addresses three related questions: 1) what are the basic institutional characteristics of constitutional designs and electoral systems in Africa's emerging democracies? 2) What factors account for the choice of these constitutional designs and electoral systems? 3) What are their consequences for conflict management, for government stability, and for democratic consolidation in Africa? The investigation collects and analyzes data on the key institutional features of constitutional designs and electoral systems in all 48 African countries which have made, or are scheduled to make, the transition to democracy; and the results of presidential and legislative elections. The first type of data are collected for three time period: 1945-circa 1965 (decolonization and early postindependence, and largely democratic, period); circa 1990 (largely authoritarian period, but also including varied democratic experiments); and the post-1990 redemocratization period. The second type of data will be collected for the post-1990 period. This award for Research at an Undergraduate Institution promises to considerably enhance our understanding of the topic. The data set to be generated will be of assistance to other scholars interested in the requisites of democratic systems. ***"

The fundamental importance of sleep, as both as state and a process, for development has been recognized by developmental scientists for over 20 years and studies have linked quantitative (e.g., total amount of sleep per night) and qualitative (e.g., sleep efficiency--time in bed that the person is actually asleep) sleep parameters to a broad range of health-relevant outcomes in samples of children. Researchers also have identified many biological and social factors that influence both sleep quantity and quality, however, the bulk of research with children has focused on infancy, school-age children, and adolescents; with relatively little research attention devoted to the impact of sleep during early childhood (nominally 2.5-6 years). Moreover, most studies covering the early childhood period relied on subjective reports from sleep diaries or questionnaires completed by parents and examined problems associated with medical conditions or with sleep deficits. Finally, most of these studies recruited families in which children were cared for at home by a parent. This study of up to 270 children (90 in each of 3 consecutive years), recruited between the ages of 2.5 and 4.5 years of age and followed up to two years after initial enrollment, starts from the premise that sleep parameters are continua ranging from maladaptive to optimal, with most children falling in a mid-range that is adequate for normal growth and functioning, rather than from the premise that sleep parameters are either ""disordered"" or not. The investigators for this project will recruit the sample from a high-quality early education center in a large metropolitan area from the Southeastern USA. Selecting such a sample allows them to consider both the positive growth promoting benefits of sleep as well as the constraints on development and adaptation imposed by less adequate sleep. The sample also allows generalization of prior research on home-reared children to the most common child-care setting now being used in the USA (group care). The researchers will also measure sleep objectively by using activity monitors worn by the children over a week's time, which makes it possible to examine the trajectories of nighttime and naptime sleep in greater detail than is possible from parent reports; although the project will retain the parent diary method so as to provide contextual information (e.g., any illnesses the child suffered while sleep was monitored; medications taken, etc.) to supplement the sleep measures from activity monitoring. The investigators also will conduct a comprehensive assessment of child adaptation in their homes and early education center classrooms, including the domains of social, emotional, cognitive, and academic functioning. These assessments involve extensive direct observations of child behavior at home and in the classroom, standard tests of receptive vocabulary and age-appropriate academic achievement, laboratory tasks designed to assess self-regulation, emotion knowledge, executive functioning, and parent/child and teacher/child relationships. <br/><br/>The study will provide fundamental information about the developmental course of sleep (quantity and quality) over early childhood and the environmental factors that constrain and/or promote adequate and optimal sleep. Because children will be observed repeatedly over the course of the study, the researchers will also be able to examine the temporal/causal influences of parent/child relationships on sleep (and vice versa), as well as the relative influences of both sleep and adult/child relationships on the quality of social/emotional and cognitive/academic functioning assessed in the classroom. A fourth valuable contribution of the study arises as a consequence of the sample itself. The early education program collaborating with the study serves a multi-ethnic but predominantly middle-class population (about 30% ethnic minority status families enrolling children) but also serves children from low-resource families (~10% of total enrollment). This distribution of children will permit testing hypotheses concerning health disparities between minority ethnic status and/or more economically challenged groups (compared to majority ethnic status and/or middle SES groups) with regard to sleep and its consequences. In addition to these fundamental contributions to the science of sleep, this study will likely have broad implications for childcare policy, curriculum development for young children, teacher training, and parent education."

Research in southern Peru demonstrates the early Wari State (ca. AD 600-1000), established a distant frontier colony in Moquegua (~600 km from their capital) with state personnel occupying one hill, Cerro Baul, and a large contingent of support personnel occupying an adjacent hill, Cerro Mejia. The project's excavations at Cerro Mejia will establish if the people settled at this state-instigated colony were drawn from the immediate area or forced to migrate from a distant region. More broadly, the project examines ancient border relations in the context of major demographic and economic transformations, and provides a case study of the labor management capabilities of an early state-level society. <br/><br/>Archaeological and historic research suggests that first-generation states are different from their later counterparts. As fledgling states expanded beyond their geographic core to incorporate foreign subjects they confronted strategic decisions about their own administrative limitations for controlling outlying territories. In most instances, delegates from the polity's capital were sent to peripheries to manage state interests, but expansive states may also employ indirect strategies of working through foreign representatives.<br/><br/>Comparative cross-cultural studies indicate that first-generation states sometimes restructured local populations. The project will examine many variables to understand the relationship between state representatives on Cerro Baul and support populations living on Cerro Mejia. Proceeding from prior investigations at both sites, the one year project uses a strategy of broad sampling and focused excavation of archaeological households to test models of population management, assess the origins of the people occupying Mejia, and define their contributions to the Wari state's political economy. Results from this preliminary project will be drawn from analyses of botanical, ceramic, faunal, and lithic assemblages, as well as detailed contextual data. The project is designed to a) elucidate the economic organization of the Mejia colony; b) identify whether it was self-sustaining or state supported; and c) provide the basic parameters to frame further research of the labor management strategies developed by Wari state leaders.<br/><br/>At a larger scale this research examines the confrontation between two societies, the expanding Wari State and the subjugated group that occupied Cerro Mejia. Because expansive states incorporated people speaking different languages, groups with different ideals, and societies practicing different lifeways, studying these ancient polities through archaeology provides significant points of reference to understand ongoing processes of confrontation and transformation in modern polities around the globe. <br/><br/>The project team combines the research experiences of diverse archaeological specialists to provide educational and research support for two graduate students, as well as learning opportunities to Peruvian and US undergraduate students. The gathered data and collections will be available for future research at Museo Contisuyo, Moquegua, Peru. As partners with this local museum, Donna Nash and other members of the project team will continue their participation in local educational outreach programs, as well as participate in Peruvian and international conferences to promote collaboration and information exchange with archaeological colleagues. Findings from this research will also be disseminated through websites in English and Spanish, as well as peer-reviewed publications. The project will contribute to understanding an important aspect of Peru's multi-ethnic heritage and share these findings with the local and global community."

It responds to the puzzle: Why don't legislative majorities curb courts that prevent the implementation of enacted legislation when those majorities have the constitutional ability to do so? The research team proposes that judicial protection of minorities can emerge as an unintended by-product of majoritarian politics. Popular majorities support judicial review because courts benefit majorities by protecting them against ""corrupt"" or ""captured"" legislatures. Researchers test this theory using a controlled experiment that assesses whether respondents? evaluations of the US Supreme Court relative to the Congress are changed by reports of congressional corruption, news of judicial decisions that conform to subjects? preferences, or an interaction of these two treatments.<br/><br/>The proposed research is valuable for scholars of political development and institutional design, especially in democracies with multiracial and multiethnic societies.

The unraveling of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the USSR speaks of the risks of opening the political arena. The rise of ethnic conflicts underscores how easily claims for sovereignty can spread across groups and regions, and from central to regional and local governments. Even when the breakup of the state has involved relatively little violence, as in the USSR, the conflicts raise serious questions about whether multiethnic successor states can survive the post-communist transition intact. In Russia, many of the same problems that dissolved the Soviet Union now challenge the federal government. Liberal reformers have come to see ethnonationalism as a major threat to democratization -- inimical to the spirit of tolerance and the concern for individual rights that liberal democracy requires. Yet the level and character of ethnonational mobilization in non-Russian territories is far from clear and its connection to support for democratization even less so. This project examines the nature and level of ethnonationalism and support for democratization in three regions of the Russian Federation: Northern Ossetia, Tatarstan and Sakha. Mass surveys will be conducted and contextual data will be attached to all individual level responses. The project will produce a dataset of 3,000 individual interviews to be archived at the completion of the research project."

Whereas much scholarly attention has been devoted to understanding the institutional conditions that lead to violence in ethnically-divided societies, very little is known about what institutions can do to improve ethnic-relations once violence is a foregone conclusion. Bosnia-Herzegovina represents an ideal case for evaluating theories of ethnic conflict and cooperation and this project employs a novel method of empirical analysis for achieving this purpose.<br/><br/>This dissertation research provides an opportunity to link general theories of ethnic relations across the dividing line of pre- and post-conflict. Empirical findings from this study will help resolve many unanswered questions on the effectiveness of international peacekeeping interventions and avenues for restructuring multi-ethnic states to prevent the occurrence and reoccurrence of violent ethnic conflict in many parts of the world. As such, the theoretical, methodological-empirical, and policy bases of this research can be applied to post-conflict environments beyond the Bosnian case and mark the beginnings of a research program that is truly global in perspective. The use of combined survey and experimental methods has not been attempted before in any post-conflict environment, and therefore, the research design and the empirical data generated from it will serve as first steps in what is currently an uncharted area of research."

Chicoloapan Viejo was occupied for nearly two thousand years, through the rise and dissolution of the successive Teotihuacan, Toltec, and Aztec states. Its longevity and location on the regional margins of these societies make it a strategic site for advancing knowledge of the sociopolitical and economic relationships among urban capitals and rural communities. This study concerns rural domestic life during the period associated with the height and collapse of Teotihuacan (100 BC-AD 650) and the subsequent reorganization of the region during the Epiclassic period (AD 650-850). As a powerful, multiethnic, urban society without precedent in North America, Teotihuacan is among the world's most fascinating early states, and yet a little is currently known of its administration of the regional population. For example, were rural populations relatively self-sufficient, economically, or tightly linked to regional exchange networks that included or were managed by the capital? Were rural households socially organized like those of urban Teotihuacan, and how did they change after the collapse of the state? Did this dramatic political transformation significantly disrupt social and economic practices among rural settlements, as it did in the capital, or were rural households resilient?<br/><br/>The research questions central to this study necessitate basic information concerning household economic practices and social organization. Two seasons of excavation involving the lateral exposure of domestic architecture and activity areas will be conducted, each followed by one year of analysis of spatial data, excavated artifacts, faunal and archaeobotanical remains, and floor sediments. Data from contexts including middens, house floors, and burials will permit an examination of diversity among households in social, economic, and ritual practices as well as changes in these practices through time. <br/><br/>This research advances knowledge of the earliest urbanized sociopolitical landscapes by providing needed information concerning rural life. The longitudinal view offered by this project contributes important information about how early states such as Teotihuacan met the challenges of regional administration and why they fell apart. This research is timely, as the investigation of ancient rural communities is increasingly hampered by the destruction of archaeological sites caused by Mexico City's urban sprawl. Chicoloapan Viejo itself is imminently threatened by the construction of new roads and houses, and it is one of only a few remaining archaeological sites where questions of rural organization in the ancient Basin of Mexico may be investigated.<br/><br/>This project provides opportunities for graduate students from multiple institutions to generate data for use in their own doctoral dissertations and to contribute to future research in the region. Scholarly interaction between the U.S. and Mexico is supported through collaboration with Mexican colleagues. Finally, the project contributes to the conservation of small archaeological sites in the Mexico City area by increasing local awareness of archaeological resources and cultural heritage."

Molecular genetic data can provide a fresh look at the ongoing study of the Tiwanaku expansion and the biological composition and structuring of Tiwanaku colonies. The data from the proposed research will provide the first large number of genetic sequences (=50) for the Osmore drainage and the Tiwanaku population in general. Furthermore, these data, in combination with spatial and mortuary data, are an effective means of evaluating the hypothesis that the Tiwanaku polity was a multi-ethnic society.<br/><br/>On a larger scale, these data will represent an ancient sample that can be compared to data from other native groups to make inferences regarding the time and nature of the peopling of the Americas in general and South America specifically. Ancient genetic data are particularly helpful in these studies because they provide information about the genetic composition for an indigenous population prior to Western influence. This is especially beneficial for the western coast of South America where direct colonization by Europeans, catalyzed by the rich geological and marine resources and arable land, had strong effects on the demography of native populations.<br/><br/>An additional benefit of this research will be understanding the connection between prehistoric and modern American Indians. The focus of this study is to illuminate the biological connections of Chen Chen peoples, both to their time frame and society, as well as to modern Native populations throughout the Americas. Studies of DNA diversity from ancient and modern Native Americans have determined a degree of continuity both temporally and spatially for some regions. Yet, the occurrence of continuity is not universal. By comparing modern native DNA sequences to those of prehistory, we gain better understanding of the degree of genetic continuity over time as well as a temporal framework for population events. In conjunction with this research, a collaborative project between the Laboratorio Genetica at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos and the Stone Laboratory at the University of New Mexico has been formed to collection additional data on modern Native American populations throughout Peru so as to compare them with Chen Chen and other American Populations."

Covering 630 sq. km. the project area extends from sea level to approximately 500 m. elevation and includes a variety of vegetational zones. Thus the research should provide information which is relevant to understanding the prehistory within other portions of this long peninsula. Given its proximity to the United States and the very extensive archaeological investigation conducted in coastal regions of US southern California, it is surprising that the prehistory of Baja is almost unknown. Therefore it provides an excellent context to examine and attempt to validate patterns observed to the North. There archaeologists have noted that complex - at a hunting and gathering level of subsistence - forms of social organization developed. These were characterized by specialized production of socially significant items such as shell beads and large scale trade networks. Many archaeologists believe that a reliance on stable and productive marine resources is primarily responsible for this phenomenon. However other archaeologists have noted that resources such as shellfish require significant amounts of time to process and prepare for consumption. They also point out that complex societies failed to develop in many other resource rich coastal areas and therefore other important factors must be involved. Baja California with its long coastline and its proximity to southern California makes an excellent venue to address this question. Dr. Moore's project will address three basic issues: 1. What is the antiquity of coastal adaptations in the region? 2. What is the nature of prehistoric responses to climatic fluctuations over the last ca. 12,000 years? and 3. Given current ethnohistoric and ethnographic data, what were the basic patterns of settlement and subsistence employed in the area. The research will involve: a systematic survey based on a stratified sample of the project area; preparation of detailed site plans; and collection of selected radiocarbon samples to develop a corpus of absolute dates for the region. California State University Dominguez Hills is a multiethnic institution of undergraduate education and the project will serve to introduce students to archaeological field research and, hopefully, encourage them to pursue careers in science."

The central focus will be an examination of the ethnic differences in household response to warning and subsequent preparations as well as specific restorative activities undertaken following impact. Household preparation activities refer to potential loss of life and damage to property. Household restoration activities include those actions undertaken by households to deal with the emergency situation following impact and short-term actions undertaken to restore some semblance of normal household function. The multi-ethnic nature of South Florida will allow for a more complete examination and assessment of ethnic variation in these activities. This research will combine a field survey of approximately 300 households located in heavily impacted areas and telephone surveys of approximately 1000 households serviced by Miami media markets and in the hurricane warning zone to assess ethnic variations in preparedness and restoration activities. While the literature has often alluded to ethnic variations in disaster activities, the nature of these variations has yet to be fully research. Social science literature is replete with discussions of the importance of race and ethnicity for employment, income, education, socioeconomic status, housing quality and ownership, access to political power, family organization and structure, and the like. All of these factors play critical roles in preparedness and restoration activities. In addtion, there are often language and other cultural differences among ethnic populations, such as those of South Florida. From both a theoretical and applied perspective, it is important to understand the role of ethnicity in disaster response and management."

Dr. Margaret Beck is studying the relationships between sedentary Hohokam agriculturalists (related to the modern O'odham) and more mobile Lowland Patayan groups (perhaps related to Yuman-speaking groups such as the modern Maricopa). The territories of these groups overlapped along the Hohokam western frontier, near what is now Gila Bend, Arizona. Current archaeological evidence suggests that after A.D. 1000-1100, Patayan groups may have migrated into traditional Hohokam territory to the east, contributing to the formation of the multi-ethnic communities seen in the historical and modern periods. <br/><br/>In this study, Patayan population movements will be identified through the spread of Patayan potters into Hohokam territory, who would have manufactured Patayan vessels using local materials. The primary hypothesis is that that many of the Patayan ceramics recovered from Hohokam territory were manufactured there, reflecting resident Patayan potters, and were not imported from western Lowland Patayan territory. In order to see patterns of regional exchange and migration, the places of manufacture for Patayan and other ceramics will be determined using chemical composition analysis specifically, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) for 350 ceramic fragments and 20 natural clay samples. These data will be combined with data from a large regional INAA database to trace ceramics to their place of manufacture, and will create a still-larger database for future researchers. The INAA patterns will be combined with other lines of evidence from other studies, including ceramic, shell, obsidian, and petroglyph distributions, to better understand regional exchange patterns and the extent and significance of eastward Patayan migration.<br/><br/>Patayan-Hohokam relationships are of anthropological interest as another potential case of interaction, interdependence, and kinship ties between two groups with visibly different settlement patterns and economies. Such relationships have been documented worldwide between foragers or other relatively mobile groups and adjacent sedentary food producers, although the nature and intensity of these relationships varies. The late prehistoric social landscape studied here also sets the stage for later developments in the region. Patayan migration into Hohokam territory in the Middle Gila, Salt, and Santa Cruz River valleys contributed to regional social and cultural change in the last few centuries of prehistory. Their experience is important to our understanding of interactions between groups of different social and economic complexity, habitation and adaptation in the Papagueria of southwestern Arizona, the changing cultural landscape in the Hohokam Classic period (ca. A. D. 1150-1450), and the development of historical-period and modern Native American groups in the region. The roots of historical-period territories and interactions in the southern Southwest lie in the prehistoric period addressed by this study. This project can significantly contribute to a larger discussion between professional archaeologists, Native American communities, and the general public about regional interaction in the late prehistoric and protohistoric periods."

The importance of short-range interactions such as hydrogen bonds and long-range interactions with charged residues will be determined. Changes in protonation states and rotamer preferences of surrounding residues will be followed for each reaction. In addition, work will be carried out in collaboration with Batista and Brudvig of Yale to look at the proton coupling to the electron transfer reactions that occur in the Mn cluster of the oxygen-evolving complex of PSII. Several thousand proteins will be studied to determine interactions of charged groups in different protein contexts. Analysis will focus on ligand and substrate binding in protein active sites. The pKas of active site residues will be calculated in a different group of proteins. The pKas and Ems of cofactors (eg. flavins, iron-sulfur clusters) will be determined in diverse proteins. The factors that determine the affinity of common charged groups on substrates or cofactors (eg. phosphate groups) will be determined.

Data from over 40,000 U.S. employees of a single organization allows examination of demographic combinations of staff across units, including large numbers of Whites, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Americans. This research offers a unique opportunity to examine each of these groups in workplaces where they numerically dominate and are in the minority. Dr. Offermann will compare the effects of different supervisor/subordinate racial, ethnic, or gender combinations on individual and organizational outcomes using attitude data, retention and turnover data, organizational performance, and management evaluations. The key hypothesis is that identification with a superordinate social category (the organization) can reduce the effects of demographic differences. Two of the primary methods will be to measure and compare diversity within and across organizational units, and to conduct qualitative examinations of more and less successful diverse workplaces. These methods are aimed at understanding the factors involved in creating successfully inclusive workplaces. Using multiple years of data, longitudinal analyses will help to determine whether increasing staff diversification over time or prolonged exposure to working in diverse units affects responses. <br/><br/>The results of this research will contribute significantly to knowledge of intergroup relations, and advance knowledge of the effects of diversity in multiracial, multiethnic work settings.

During its height in the early first millennium AD Teotihuacan was the largest city in the Americas and one of the largest in the world. Today, being a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the most visited ruins in the Americas, Teotihuacan is of great interest to a broad audience. <br/><br/>Though Teotihuacan is famed for its high-level of civic planning, cosmopolitan populace, and broad economic reach, such issues require more intensive investigations within understudied portions of the city. Investigations of this project focus on the Tlajinga district, a cluster of neighborhoods to the south of Teotihuacan that was inhabited by a lower socioeconomic stratum of the city's populace, was the locus of intensive utilitarian craft production, and is bisected by the terminus of the city's central artery named the Street of the Dead by the later Aztecs. The Tlajinga district provides an opportune setting for examining issues of broad interest to social and behavioral sciences and represents a minimally explored portion of the city whose archaeological record is threatened by contemporary urbanization surrounding greater Mexico City. To date, only one of approximately 90 apartment compounds - the multi-family residential complexes of Teotihuacan - has been excavated. <br/><br/>Research goals of the project scale from the level of the household to the level of the urbanization of the city as a whole. One household activity of particular interest is the production of obsidian blades - the utilitarian cutting implement of the period - in one compound, and its implications for the organization of markets and interregional exchange. This compound will be excavated and the obsidian acquisition, production, and distribution system will be analyzed technologically and geochemically. At the district level, a complex consisting of likely temples around a plaza will be studied for a better understanding of administrative and religious activities that connected neighborhoods and articulated them with the urban fabric of the multi-ethnic city.

The goal is to diversify and build leadership in the field of program evaluation; as well as to strengthen evaluator skills in assessing STEM programmatic initiatives directed towards multiethnic and underrepresented populations. This will be accomplished through three major activities:<br/>(1) collaboration between selected HBCUs to assess current program evaluation efforts and related research and teaching activities on each of the planning group campuses and to identify effective models of evaluation capacity building and networking, (2) the creation of a communications network and mechanism for information sharing regarding evaluation instruction and practice among HBCUs and between HBCUs and other higher education institutions, (3) meeting with representatives from public and private funding agencies, foundations and organizations (e.g., NSF, NAFEO, W. K. Kellogg Foundation, etc,) to promote diversity in evaluation and to share the work of the HBCU - Evaluators Planning Group, faculty evaluators/researchers from six HBCUs, who will coordinate planning activities on their respective campuses.<br/><br/>This project will bring together interdisciplinary teams of evaluators and evaluative researchers who are skilled in various disciplines and methodologies, sensitized to cultural issues related to evaluation methods, and knowledgeable of strategies to make connections between research and practice. This collaborative and multidisciplinary approach provides an opportunity identify and establish common measures across these institutions; discern best practices for engaging underrepresented students in STEM careers related to evaluation; and increase participants' knowledge and understanding of diversity issues in program evaluation. This project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in program evaluation, while advancing program evaluation teaching, training, and scholarship. The project also will enhance academic networks as well as partnerships within and across STEM disciplines, non-STEM disciplines, and professional evaluation organizations."

However, most of this research is based on cross-cultural survey data, and fails to include primary ethnography or detailed accounts of daily cooperation. To solve this problem, graduate student, Timothy M. Waring, under the direction of Dr. Richard Mcelreath and Dr. Peter J. Richerson, has designed a new hybrid research methodology. It blends traditional ethnography with new experimental economic games, allowing him to test cross-cultural hypotheses without sacrificing ethnographic detail. Waring will investigate whether the social boundaries found in diverse societies damage public goods through an intensive study of cooperative irrigation practices in villages of the Palani Hills of Tamil Nadu, India. <br/><br/>To answer this question, Waring will utilize caste identity as a unique type of cultural and ethnic diversity that has significant impact on social and economic relations. Focusing on the traditional village governance systems that manage local justice and irrigation, he will undertake qualitative ethnographic research, including participant observation, focal individual follows, and targeted focus groups. Next, a sample of farmers from six villages, stratified by caste, will be interviewed on personal identity, caste interactions, irrigation, and demographic variables. A subset of these survey participants will be selected for voluntary participation in two specially tailored economic experiments, the dictator game and the public goods game. These experiments will provide additional, quantitative measures of the effect of caste identity on cooperation and resource sharing, and will be analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. <br/><br/>This research will provide needed insight into how individuals in multi-ethnic societies interact over common resources. For the Indian case, a detailed understanding of the functioning of multi-caste cooperative irrigation management may help to avoid future resource conflicts, such as those that have fueled regional violence. More generally, this research linkage of ethnographic and experimental data will enrich theoretical and practical understanding of the role ethnic boundaries play in development and conflict wherever they occur. The research also will contribute to the education of a graduate student."

Colonial California was a place where Spaniards, criollos, mestizos, mullatos, Mexican Indians, and Baja California Indians interacted with California's very diverse group of indigenous peoples. Previous studies have argued that California's indigenous peoples were either acculturated into Spanish life ways or resisted Spanish life ways through the static maintenance of indigenous culture. These models assume culture contact occurred exclusively between homogeneous groups of European and Indigenous peoples and exclude discussion of other sorts of culture contacts such as those among California Indians and Mexican Indian settlers. This research will archaeologically test the hypothesis that indigenous identity in colonial California was heterogeneous and structured more by the ways in which it cross-cut boundaries of Spanis and Nativ rather than solely by a Native acceptance of or resistance to Spanis culture. <br/><br/>Locally produced ceramics offer a unique window through which the articulation of ethnically diverse peoples can be discussed as a process of interaction. Missionware pottery is a utilitarian earthenware produced in this frontier region during the California Mission Period. All actors participating in California colonial life had unconscious and overt cultural rules concerning how vessels, be they pots or baskets, were to be stylistically produced. These multiple technological styles influenced the production of Missionwares in California in ways that have social significance. It is hypothesized that formal, patterned variations exist in the way in which people of colonial California made Missionwares. Actors participating in the practices of different social communities create such patterning. This research will examine the ways these communities produced, reproduced, and cross-cut the multiethnic traditions of colonial California's native peoples and colonists. Such data will be useful in understanding how these actors constructed identities in relationship to those communities of practice.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project extends beyond the boundaries of this single region. Unrefined earthenwares are uncovered at most New World sites of culture contact from Florida to Peru. It is the goal of this research to introduce a creative methodology to the diverse group of researchers who encounter this ubiquitous ceramic ware across sites of culture contact. <br/><br/>This research has broader impacts within modern indigenous communities. It has the potential to reconstruct complex interactions among historic California groups and inform on issues such as ethnogenesis and group identity. Results of this project will be communicated to the scientific community through presentations at various scientific societies and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed anthropological journals. Furthermore, both the junior PI as well as undergraduate assistants from UC Santa Cruz will receive training in methods of ceramic analysis."

The research will observe the formation of historical narratives and the delineation of ""communities"" through the lens of the object as museum staff, community members, curators, and the objects themselves interact to co-produce new representations and narratives. Objects are at the heart of the investigation since groups define, lay claim to, repudiate and are in turn defined by them. The project interrogates how definitions of ""community"" and ""expertise"" affect the resulting exhibitions, and how power relations infuse decisions that seem innocuous. The resulting ethnography will not only compare how approaches to race, class and gender have changed between the 1969 and 2009 exhibitions, but it will most crucially provide insight into how cultural institutions collaborate with alleged ""non-experts"" to provide new, dynamic forms of knowledge. This research brings together insights and theoretical tools from the disparate fields of visual anthropology, material culture studies and science and technology studies to explore the role of objects in performing identity and constructing historical narratives. The project is an investigation of science and its publics, contributing to understanding how members of underrepresented populations participate in the creation and consumption of knowledge presented in museums. It will impact how institutions collaborate with communities to produce more multivocal narratives of identity and difference. The project also has educational relevance in producing deeper understandings of exhibition reception by multiethnic stakeholders. It will examine the co-creation of narratives in conjunction with diverse communities; such narratives have huge educational potential because of their public prominence, use in the curriculum of elementary schools, and their presentation of public culture and generally accepted views of history."

Wyllys Andrews V, Jeb J. Card will analyze the ceramic artifacts from the Spanish colonial site of Ciudad Vieja, El Salvador. Ciudad Vieja, the original settlement of San Salvador, is located outside of the modern metropolis. Historical documents place the occupation between 1528 - 1545 A.D., a very short period of time in archaeological terms. Ciudad Vieja was an outpost of the Spanish Conquest, the process of unraveling and transforming three thousand years of Mesoamerican civilization. Documentary information, especially of indigenous culture, is minimal for these early years but suggests that many of the socioeconomic patterns of the Spanish colonies, and later Latin America, only begin to take familiar forms after Ciudad Vieja was abandoned. Typically, archaeological study of this early Conquest period is hampered by modern urbanization and lack of tight chronological control. Ciudad Vieja is a rare Conquest-period Spanish center accessible to archaeological study. <br/><br/>Historical records focus on the literate and the powerful, but people of all ethnicities and walks of life at Ciudad Vieja used and discarded pottery, the most common artifact class at the site. The Ciudad Vieja project has recovered ceramic vessels from a wide range of contexts including households humble and opulent, blacksmith's workshops, military posts, and the town hall. The short occupation means that all of these areas were in use at roughly the same time, mirroring the once-living community. The vessels discarded in and around these areas are forensic evidence of the day-to-day activities of one generation of colonists and local inhabitants participating in the very foundations of globalization. Patterning in these activities will reveal the socioeconomic relationships that formed the basis of this multiethnic society. Analysis of ceramic vessel construction techniques will probe economic production and distribution within San Salvador. Cross-culturally, people communicate information about themselves through the tableware they use to host guests. A significant proportion of serving vessels used at Ciudad Vieja incorporated local and European design ideas, reflecting the cultural interplay within early colonial society. Analysis of the design and distribution of these vessels will determine the scale of indigenous status display in the face of invasion and forced acculturation. <br/><br/>The proposed research will have a broader impact on several levels. Card will work with El Salvadoran students from the Universidad Tecnologica de El Salvador, who will gain a solid background in laboratory and computer-aided statistical analysis. The Salvadoran government is currently preparing Ciudad Vieja as an archaeological park for the education of the Salvadoran and international public, and the results of Card's research will help inform the presentation of the site. As part of the Ciudad Vieja project, Card has presented research results in American scientific meetings and in Spanish-language publications in El Salvador, and the results of this study will be published in Spanish and English, in a variety of formats including refereed journals. Card will also be responsible for the design and growth of the Ciudad Vieja web presence, opening up the project's research to a large audience."

The past two decades have seen a resurgence of interest in associational life. Some researchers place civil society at the heart of democratic consolidation. Others cite examples of authoritarian states supported by dense yet uncivil society. Few studies, however, analyze what forces shape the associational landscape?s character. Thus, this research asks: Why do associations arise and what leads them to become civil or uncivil in character? A survey of relevant scholarly literature reveals two types of explanations: state-centered and economic theories. This project tests and builds upon these theories through comparative analysis of associational life in pre-WWI and interwar [1918-1939] Poland. The project employs cross-regional and cross-time historical comparisons. It utilizes historical narratives and descriptive statistics to examine the development of associational life in pre-WWI and interwar Poland. In addition to theoretical contributions, this research will contribute to knowledge on civic society in Eastern Europe. Polish civic society has been researched extensively in the post-communist context. Yet there are few studies of pre-WWII associational life in the ethnically diverse societies of early twentieth century Eastern Europe. This dissertation addresses this gap in existing research.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>The study incorporates research that is often overlooked as it is not readily available to non-Polish speakers. Thus, it will bring to an English-speaking audience studies that have been marginalized due to language barriers. A historical analysis of factors that shaped the associational landscape in interwar Poland will shed light on the implications of social and economic policies pursued by modern, multi-ethnic states with growing civic societies and uncertain paths to democratization. This project contributes to modern debates by helping to identify the types of policies, social or economic, which support the development of civil society."

CDEI is based on a classification of political parties around the world in a given year as ethnic, multiethnic and on-ethnic. The Principal Investigator uses this classification to generate over forty variables related to ethnicity and institutions.<br/>The variable that gets the highest priority in the time-series expansion is EVOTE -- the percentage of vote<br/>obtained by ethnic political parties in each country for the year 1996. The PI codes several other variables<br/>related to the implicit and explicit mobilization of ethnic identities by political parties.<br/>The purpose in building and expanding CDEI is to test competing propositions on the rise of ethnic parties and<br/>democratic stability. According to a classic proposition in empirical democratic theory, ethnically divided societies invariably give rise to ethnic political parties and ethnic political parties destabilize a democratic system. But other work argues or implies that no matter how they arise, ethnic parties may have the opposite effect they may actually stabilize democracy by institutionalizing discontent which might otherwise be expressed through violence.<br/>Because of the lack of cross-national data on ethnic political parties and the degree of support they obtain in<br/>democratic systems, neither proposition has been empirically verified. We do have cross-national data on ethnic groups, which, input into the Index of Ethnolinguistic Fractionalization (ELF), have been the basis for studies that explore the relationship between ethnic diversity and democratic stability. But these data, and the ELF index, are divorced from a theoretical understanding of the nature of ethnic groups. Although theories of the origin of ethnic groups are constructivist, the data on ethnic groups and the ELF measure remain resolutely primordialist. As a result, we do not know what the relationship between any aspect of ethnicity and democratic stability is despite the large body of work on the subject. CDEI, which incorporates constructivist insights, and is specifically designed to test propositions in democratic theory about the origins and effects of ethnic political parties, aims to fill one part of this gap.<br/>Although CDEI is motivated by my own interest in testing propositions linking ethnic party behavior and democratic consolidation, the data it generates can be used to answer a very broad range of questions in the social sciences about the origins and effects of politicized ethnic identities and therefore to inform public policy on the relationship between politicized ethnic identities and political and economic outcomes. A sample of such questions includes the following: What is the effect of the explicit politicization of ethnic divisions on some outcome of interest, including war, riots, economic growth, public policy, welfare spending and so on? Is the politicization of particular types of ethnic divisions associated (e.g. region or religion or language or tribe) associated with particular types of outcomes? What determines the size of the coalition that an ethnic party is likely to mobilize? Are we more likely to see the ethnification of politics in new democracies? Is there a link between colonial history and the degree of ethnic politicization? How rapidly do politically activated ethnic identities change over time and what explains such change? Is there a link between ethnic majoritarianism and conflict? And so on.<br/>Broader Social Value: The Principal Investigator facilitates the broad use of the data generated by CDEI in two ways: (1) By inviting the involvement of other scholars in the design of the dataset, making the data widely available and offering an intensive introduction in the design of the dataset to those who wish to use it. The researcher does this through a combination of web-based portals and face-toface workshops. (2) By integrating the data collection process into graduate student education. Graduate students are currently involved as collaborators and co-authors in all aspects of the project, and the researcher plans to introduce a new laboratory course that combines theoretical instruction with hands on experience in data collection at NYU."

The data gathered through these methods will be used to answer the following questions: 1) Who is involved in Haitian radio production in Montréal and what are their everyday work and linguistic practices that contribute to generating audience-appropriate programming and representing an image of a plural Québec within Haitian radio? 2) How are decisions to broadcast in a language or a variety of language arrived at, implemented and justified at the organizational level and what are the consequences of on-air language choice on the daily operations of these radio stations? And 3) What are the language ideologies undergirding and shaping French and Kreyòl language choice and language policy at each radio station both on- and off-air, and how are they made evident through language practices? <br/><br/>By attending to the ways Haitian radio producers negotiate their insertion into Québec's cultural landscape through their on-air language choices, this research adds to the theorization of radio, a widespread yet understudied medium.

This project addresses the significance of this trend by studying the suburbanization patterns for a wide range of racial/ethnic groups in five major metropolitan areas. The study goes well beyond past research on suburbanization by focusing on differences among the suburban places to which different groups gain access. It also examines differences within major racial/ethnic categories (for instance, between the Chinese and Japanese among Asians). The analysis will investigate how minority-group members attain residence in places with characteristics that affect positively the quality of life and life chances of their residents. The investigators will estimate models that view locational outcomes as a function of the socioeconomic, assimilation, and life-cycle characteristics of individuals, and will test whether these models vary by ethnic group and across metropolitan areas. Further, the investigators will analyze the ability of individuals to ""convert"" their socioeconomic and assimilation characteristics into favorable residenti allocations."

She will analyze archaeological ceramics from the site of Calixtlahuaca (1100-1430 CE) to evaluate provincial peoples' responses to being conquered and made part of the Aztec Empire. Calixtlahuaca was an important regional capital that was conquered by the Aztec Empire in the 1470s, and this project compares the time periods before the founding of the Aztec Empire, during the beginning of the empire but before Calixtlahuca's conquest, and after the Aztec conquest of the site. Comparative work on empires shows that when a power conquers an area, it has to follow up with negations with multiple local factions to establish lasting control over the region. Because an empire wants a stable, taxable population, conquered populations retain some degree of leverage in this process of establishing the terms of their rule. Both the empire and the province are likely to use multiple, often contradictory strategies to improve their position. Provincial actions can support imperial interests, undercut them, or be effectively neutral. This project tests the conditions under which conquered peoples are likely to adopt particular types of responses. The knowledge which emerges from this project has the potential to inform on multi-ethnic states which exist today in many regions of the world. <br/><br/>The project looks at responses in the form of changes in trade patterns and household activities likely related to ethnic identity. It uses three complementary methods of analyzing ceramics - type classification, attribute analysis, and Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) - to map out trade patterns for each time periods. The patterns will be used to look at how the Aztec conquest changed what and with whom people were trading, what they were making, and general degree of well being. The project also looks at changes in both ritual items including figurines and incense burners, and as well as food serving vessels to see how these spheres of behavior were affected by Aztec contact. In addition providing information of the Aztec Empire, the project results will be useful for comparative work at a variety of levels, including investigations of imperial rule, comparisons between regions of the Aztec Empire, comparisons between sites within the Toluca Valley, and correlations between early Spanish written records and archaeological evidence. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project include promoting interaction between American and Mexican scholars, providing training for both graduate and undergraduate students, and presenting project findings to both scholarly and public audiences. Ms Huster will do her field analysis at the Colegio Mexiquense in Toluca, Mexico, where she will consult with Mexican historians. The project will involve undergraduate volunteers in Mexico and Arizona, providing students with hands-on training in ceramics analysis, statistics, and database management. Findings will be presented through entries to the existing Calixtlahuaca Archaeological Project blog, community presentations in Mexico and the United States, conference presentations, and journal publications. The raw data from the project will be made publically available through The Digital Archaeological Repository. In addition, the INAA data collected will become part of a widely used University of Missouri ceramics reference database thus strengthening its regional coverage."

Much of this growth has occurred in rural areas that have transformed rapidly from historically biracial to multi-ethnic communities. North Carolina, with the highest Latino growth rate among all U.S. states over the past decade, provides a unique opportunity to analyze ""early stage"" migration and settlement processes. Project research objectives include: 1) Identify how key micro and macro factors have shaped the migration and settlement of Latinos in the rural South; 2) Explain how Latino migration and settlement in the rural South has restructured economic, social and racial/ethnic relations in both origin and destination communities; 3) Analyze the transnational networks and relations Latinos construct over time and space linking them to homeland place of origin, U.S. gateway cities and new rural home communities in the South; and 4) Identify the most effective approaches to building new community and economic development initiatives that incorporate Latinos. The geographic focus of this multi-sited project includes three rural eastern N.C. communities, neighboring cities of the east and a town in the Tierra Caliente region of Michoacan (Mexico) with strong transnational ties to eastern N.C. This project will take a theoretically eclectic approach including multi-level analysis, gender analysis, inter-group relations and transnational paradigms. The research will employ a ""mixed method"" approach including: 1) Qualitative Interviews with Latino Families and Non-Latino residents in N.C. Rural Communities and with Key Informants; 2) Quantitative eastern N.C. Survey of Non-Latino Resident Attitudes and Perceptions of Latino Migration and Settlement; and 3) ""Michoacarolina"" Transnational Case Study in collaboration with the Mexican Migration Project (MMP).<br/><br/>Through an integrated program of research, education and outreach, this project seeks to make a significant contribution to the growing academic literature on the new geography of Latino migration, particularly to rural areas in the South; to develop urgently needed curricula that will integrate migration studies into various ECU academic programs; to mentor and support minority graduate students specializing in migration; and to provide outreach that will improve service delivery for initiatives targeting Latino communities."

Archaeology can provide a valuable window to understanding how different cultures interact since it can take a long range perspective and follow such processes often over century long time scales. The presence of biological data in the form of skeletal remains adds an additional dimension to the study. Similar interactions are visible today in multiple regions of the world.<br/><br/>With the support of the National Science Foundation, an international team, led by Dr. Stuart Tyson Smith and Dr. Michele Buzon, along with other specialists, students, and local community members will conduct a bioarchaeological research project to investigate the impact of the Egypt's New Kingdom Empire (c. 1500-1050 BC) on the Nubian Kerma Culture at the Third Cataract of the Nile River in Upper Nubia. This project builds on previous excavations at Tombos, which have documented a multi-ethnic colonial community of immigrant Egyptians and local Nubians. Excavation will include burials in the elite pyramid field of the cemetery and the previously unexplored settlement. In addition, a settlement (Hannek) and cemetery (Akkad) associated with the local Nubian Kerma culture will be explored in order to allow for a comparison of Egyptian imperial impacts on the health and identity before and after the conquest and colonization of the area. Moving beyond traditional unidirectional models of colonial encounters, this research considers the actions of both the local and foreign groups.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is the contribution to larger archaeological and anthropological research questions regarding the process of inter-cultural interactions, colonialism, and the cultural entanglements that result. Older acculturation models based upon a notion of dominant core and subordinate periphery have increasingly been replaced with more nuanced interaction based models like the one proposed here. This project will add an important case study from one of the world's earliest primary states that will be of relevance to scholars studying similar dynamics in different places and periods. The use of a multi-disciplinary bioarchaeological approach allows for a holistic examination of these issues through use of various types of data including material culture, social practices, biological relationships, geographic origins, and indications of health and disease. Tombos' unique historical context offers significant potential to shed light on the still largely unknown local impacts of the Egyptian empire, providing important data on the local people who played a role in the adoption, adaptation, and rejection of different cultural traits, as well as the interpenetration of Nubian and Egyptian features in both societies. <br/><br/>Further broader impacts of this project include the training of American and Sudanese students and researchers as well as promotion of international research collaboration. The excavation and curation of human skeletal remains from the project will provide secure storage of important archaeological and bioarchaeological data and collections as well as ensure the opportunity for future research on the material. The data produced from the proposed research will be widely disseminated in order to provide access for other researchers. Finally, this project will assist the people of Sudan in documenting the rapidly disappearing evidence of ancient Nubian life and culture resulting from settlement and cultivation. The proposed construction of a dam only ten kilometers downstream from Tombos would also heavily impact the sites and adds additional urgency to this project."

The new project, Pacific Ocean Literacy for Youth, Publics, Professionals and Scientists (POLYPPS), will be based in Hawaii. It will focus on training educators and scientists to effectively communicate ocean sciences to a multi-ethnic population within a range of cultural contexts. Lead by the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), POLYPPS is a collaboration with a broad set of partners, including universities, community colleges, research institutes, professional societies, aquariums, museums, community organizations, governmental agencies, and private companies. The partners advocate that education in the ocean sciences should involve teaching students to apply ocean literacy concepts and use inquiry-based leaning to improve not only their own lives but also their local, national, and global communities. <br/><br/>The primary objective of the POLYPPS collaboration with COSEE CA reflects the COSEE network's mission of integrating research and education in the ocean sciences. Intellectual Merit: POLYPPS will engage researchers, educators and a range of community partners in a network that builds ocean literacy for (1) Hawaii's youth (K-16 students) and public, including Hawaii's substantial, year-round transient tourist population; (2) professionals working in ocean-related businesses; and (3) scientists engaged in ocean research. We will adapt and implement the COSEE CA COS and COSIA courses for our island setting. Broader Impacts: The training for these courses and the teaching of them will create relationships to bridge formal and informal education, research, traditional cultural practices, and public activities. During the three-year period, POLYPPS will help educators employ contextual, place-based ways to engage students in STEM courses. POLYPPS' long-range goal is to build a collaborative network that connects ocean research and teaching with traditional knowledge to facilitate active engagement in stewardship and policy by all ocean users. <br/><br/>The main activities of POLYPPS will be: [1] Organize a training workshop in collaboration with COSEE CA staff that will train a cadre of professionals in Hawaii to teach the COS/COSIA courses; [2] Organize both COS/COSIA as either credit or non-credit courses throughout the University of Hawaii System for: (a) graduate science students participating in GK-12 programs and other graduate students with an interest in education and for community college students in ocean sciences who may consider a career in education; (b) pre-service and in-service K-12 educators; (c) informal educators in non-profit organizations, aquaria, museums, and government educational agencies; and (d) ocean-related businesses, hotels, and tour operators; and [3] Develop new course components that will integrate Hawaii resources, including unique traditional cultural practices and ocean policies, current research on ecosystems of particular relevance to local and regional communities and exemplary curriculum materials."

The researcher will investigate contemporary politics of big science, development and difference in Brazil using as an object of study the Alcantara Launching Center (CLA), an ambitious government project that was intended to help Brazil win ""technological independence"" when it was built in the early 1980s. Funds from the grant will support travel to Brazil, as well as room, board, and travel within the country. By 2000, Brazil had not successfully launched a satellite from the base of CLA, and there was widespread opposition in Brazil to its planned use by foreign governments. A movement to reclaim the land for displaced Afro-Brazilian communities had gained prominent support. Alcantara, the poor fishing region where the CLA is located, became a flashpoint for debates about the character and future of Brazil as a multi-ethnic and technologically developing nation-state. Through ethnographic research into the conflicts over Alcantara's fate, and building on four months of preliminary ethnographic research, this researcher will use ethnographic and archival methods to examine three groups: 1) NGOs and political organizations involved in the conflicts over the CLA; 2) scientists and others working in or on issues relating to the base; 3) and communities affected or displaced by the base. By investigating the politics of an embattled big science project in a context of relative technological disadvantage and longstanding technological ambition, this project is expected to offer an ethnographic vantage on the cultural specificities and lived- effects of some of the most contentious changes facing contemporary Brazil--changes that are similar to those faced in much of the developing world."

Historically, Sranan is not only one of the oldest but also one of the most divergent of the Caribbean English creoles. This evolution is the ultimate outcome of an intriguing colonial history, involving a swapping of colonies between the English and the Dutch, which led English in Surinam to evolve under a complex web of influences, especially from Dutch and several African languages.<br/><br/>With support from the National Science Foundation, Ms. Jacqueline Bunting will conduct fieldwork in Paramaribo, Surinam's capital city, observing the language in its natural ecology.

These materials will be analyzed in comparison with the relevant structures in English, Dutch, Ewe, and Kikongo - all languages which bore heavily on the emergence of Sranan as a creole - in order to develop a clearer understanding of how the grammatical system of Sranan has evolved or been influenced by Dutch, the Gbe family of West African languages (notably Ewe), or Kikongo.

The site saw the development of large multi-ethnic communities between ca. AD 1250 to 1400. It presents a strong prehistoric case for migration and co-residence and well dated architecture and human remains provide a secure background for the proposed ceramic study. Dr. Zedeno will identify local ceramic traditions, nonlocal ceramics obtained before migration occurred, nonlocal ceramics associated with immigration episodes, local manufacture of foreign pots, and development of hybrid technologies. This will be accomplished through the application of neutron activation and petrographic analyses to 20 samples of decorated and plainware shreds and the reconstruction of manufacturing technology. A survey to identify and sample raw material sources will also be conducted. One goal of archaeologists is to trace the movement and intermingling of different cultural groups and often this is extremely difficult to do given the limited nature of the archaeological record. The Point of Pines region is important because data derived from a number of sources indicates that just such immigration and mingling did occur. Because of its widespread use and its durability, abundant pottery remains are recovered on many sites and Dr. Zedeno will use the controlled Point of Pines situation to determine how ceramics are affected by these social processes. The work is important not for the information it will provide about this site but because the insight gained will provide a useful archaeological tool which can be used to analyze ceramics in many parts of the world. The potential impact of this research is extremely broad."

The Arabidopsis genome contains at least 2,000 such domains. Different types of lipid signals target the domains to different cellular membranes. The interaction of lipid-binding domains with membrane surfaces is an essential part of their function. This project aims to understand, at the molecular level, how these domains are recruited to different cellular membranes and how proteins and lipid signals are organized laterally at membrane surfaces and, thus, regulate cellular processes. Function will be determined at the family and genome levels through the synthesis of computational and experimental analyses. An automated high-throughput comparative modeling pipeline will detect new instances of lipid-binding domains in the Arabidopsis genome and predict the structures of their amino acid sequences using known structures as templates. The biophysical properties of these models will be calculated and the functional predictions will be tested through the interpretation and rational design of experiments. Ultimately, detailed models of the physical interactions underlying lipid signaling pathways at membrane surfaces will be built in collaboration with experiment. This project reflects all three of the current 2010 Project focus activities: 1) Benchmarking gene function. Genes from Arabidopsis will be quantitatively compared with genes from other, much more annotated model organisms. 2) Developing genome-wide tools for analyzing gene function: The comparative modeling pipeline, which is highly modular, is the framework for a comprehensive tool that allows for the inclusion of new computational methods to facilitate both larger scale and more detailed annotation of gene function. 3) Exploring exemplary networks and systems: The results for individual lipid-binding domains will be leveraged to model how proteins and lipids collaborate to transduce cellular signaling. Finally, an automated mechanism for alerting other 2010 Program groups to potentially useful results will be implemented. Information on this project is posted at http://maat.med.cornell.edu/Arabidopsis2010/arabidopsis2010.html.<br/><br/>The foundation of this effort is a strong partnership between Weill Medical College of Cornell University (WMC) and City University of New York Brooklyn College (CB), which is a non-PhD granting institution. The values of this partnership are research, education, mentoring, and outreach activities. Through this project, two early career female scientists, one of which has two children, will receive training in new areas of biology and computation and, together, will develop a supportive research environment for women through this project as well as other areas of research. Both labs mentor many young women at all levels of education, from high school through the postdoctoral level. There is strong multidisciplinary and multiethnic student participation: Two minority female high school students were finalists in the International Intel Competition, and another minority female high school student is currently working on an Intel project. Undergraduate and graduate students at CB and WMC are being trained in computational biology by participating in this project and through formal course work. Both investigators design and teach classes in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Biochemistry, Logic and Critical Analysis, and journal-based ""Focus Groups"". The results of this project will be broadly disseminated through 1) a dedicated, publicly accessible, database-driven website with links to online Arabidopsis resources; 2) participation in multi-disciplinary conferences and Arabidopsis-specific data-support services; 3) publications in quality, multidisciplinary journals, e.g. PLoS Computational Biology, which seeks to make computation accessible to biologists; and 4) seminars presented to ""Women in Science"" programs and programs meant to recruit students from other fields into biology, e.g. American Physical Society Biology Tutorials. It is anticipated that a highly successful, eight-session, 48-speaker symposium on protein/membrane interactions, organized by one of the investigators for the American Chemical Society March 2006 meeting, is the first in a series of similar meetings that will bring together experimental and computational researchers in this field. Future meetings will have sessions devoted to Arabidopsis membrane binding proteins."

Dr. Margaret Beck is studying the relationships between sedentary Hohokam agriculturalists (related to the modern O'odham) and more mobile Lowland Patayan groups (perhaps related to Yuman-speaking groups such as the modern Maricopa). The territories of these groups overlapped along the Hohokam western frontier, near what is now Gila Bend, Arizona. Current archaeological evidence suggests that after A.D. 1000-1100, Patayan groups may have migrated into traditional Hohokam territory to the east, contributing to the formation of the multi-ethnic communities seen in the historical and modern periods. <br/><br/>In this study, Patayan population movements will be identified through the spread of Patayan potters into Hohokam territory, who would have manufactured Patayan vessels using local materials. The primary hypothesis is that that many of the Patayan ceramics recovered from Hohokam territory were manufactured there, reflecting resident Patayan potters, and were not imported from western Lowland Patayan territory. In order to see patterns of regional exchange and migration, the places of manufacture for Patayan and other ceramics will be determined using chemical composition analysis specifically, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) for 350 ceramic fragments and 20 natural clay samples. These data will be combined with data from a large regional INAA database to trace ceramics to their place of manufacture, and will create a still-larger database for future researchers. The INAA patterns will be combined with other lines of evidence from other studies, including ceramic, shell, obsidian, and petroglyph distributions, to better understand regional exchange patterns and the extent and significance of eastward Patayan migration.<br/><br/>Patayan-Hohokam relationships are of anthropological interest as another potential case of interaction, interdependence, and kinship ties between two groups with visibly different settlement patterns and economies. Such relationships have been documented worldwide between foragers or other relatively mobile groups and adjacent sedentary food producers, although the nature and intensity of these relationships varies. The late prehistoric social landscape studied here also sets the stage for later developments in the region. Patayan migration into Hohokam territory in the Middle Gila, Salt, and Santa Cruz River valleys contributed to regional social and cultural change in the last few centuries of prehistory. Their experience is important to our understanding of interactions between groups of different social and economic complexity, habitation and adaptation in the Papagueria of southwestern Arizona, the changing cultural landscape in the Hohokam Classic period (ca. A. D. 1150-1450), and the development of historical-period and modern Native American groups in the region. The roots of historical-period territories and interactions in the southern Southwest lie in the prehistoric period addressed by this study. This project can significantly contribute to a larger discussion between professional archaeologists, Native American communities, and the general public about regional interaction in the late prehistoric and protohistoric periods."

Because ninth grade achievement is often critical in predicting whether youth stay in or drop out of high school, the overarching goal of the project is to capture students' experiences at this significant juncture. The large sample (n = 1900) is comprised of Latino, African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, White, and multi-racial youth who will transition to high school in Fall of 2012. These high schools are expected to range in racial/ethnic diversity, allowing for tests of the social and academic benefits and challenges of racial/ethnic diversity during the high school transition. Data will be gathered on three achievement-related processes. The first process is academic course-taking patterns in ninth grade, including grades and credits earned. Because high school math largely functions as the gateway to high school completion and college readiness, there will be a particular focus on math course-taking in 9th grade (e.g., whether students are enrolled in Algebra I, and thus ""on time"" for college and whether they pass that course in 9th grade). The second process is the degree to which academic experiences become racialized, particularly the ways in which course-taking might segregate students along racial/ethnic lines. New measures have been developed that allow precise estimates of the degree to which individual students are teamed or clustered with the same peers for academic instruction and the degree to which their academic courses are representative of the racial/ethnic diversity of the high school. The third process is the social capital provided by exposure to cross-race/ethnic peers. It is hypothesized that African American and Latino students may fare better in diverse high schools because they gain access to important knowledge about academic opportunities (e.g., what courses to take, SAT preparation) through their cross-race ties. Thus cross-race ties can function as peer social capital, facilitating the flow of important educational information across racial/ethnic boundaries. By studying these three achievement-related processes (course-taking patterns, whether course-taking segregates students along racial/ethnic lines, and peers as social capital) the research can provide new insights into the challenges that adolescents of color face as they negotiate the high school transition as well as conditions under which greater school ethnic diversity can buffer some of those challenges. <br/><br/>The project addresses NSF criteria for broader impact in three ways. First, the research seeks to understand the ways in which large, urban multi-ethnic public high schools are organized to increase or hinder the opportunities of racial and ethnic minority adolescents to acquire competence and develop interest in STEM-related subject matter. If students do not have adequate preparation and confidence during high school, their likelihood of pursuing STEM fields in college is greatly compromised. Second, the project will have a particular focus on resilient youth and the precursors of successful pathways to high school completion even among those at high risk of dropping out. Such results can have useful implications for developing practices that promote academic engagement and college readiness for all students. Third, the research can offer transformative ways to think about the meaning and measurement of racial/ethnic diversity and opportunities to interact with peers of different racial/ethnic backgrounds even in diverse settings. This perspective can be useful for research in other social settings where the implications of increasing ethnic diversity are a primary concern and for new thinking about a science of diversity."

It is hypothesized that greater diversity can benefit students' mental health, intergroup attitudes, and school adaptation via three mediating mechanisms: (1) decreases in perceived vulnerability; (2) the formation and maintenance of cross-ethnic friendships; and (3) the development of complex social identities. These mediating mechanisms are examined in Aims 1-3. In Aim 4, the moderating influence of school structural characteristics, such as academic tracking, that may limit the mixing opportunities of students are explored. The hypotheses outlined in the four aims will be examined in a 3-year longitudinal study of approximately 3500 6th grade students as they enter one of 14 urban middle schools in southern California. The large sample will be ethnically diverse, comprised of Latino, African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, White, and multi-ethnic students. The 14 middle schools that these students attend will be carefully selected to vary in racial/ethnic composition and level of diversity. Data on students' perceived vulnerability, cross-ethnic friendships, and social identities as well as the outcomes of mental health, intergroup attitudes, and school adaptation will be gathered in fall and spring of 6th grade and in spring of 7th and 8th grade, for a total of four waves of data. Structural equation modeling and multilevel modeling will be used to track growth and change in these interrelated variables over time. By studying pathways to successful adaptation, the overarching goal of the research is to examine the conditions under which greater school ethnic diversity can buffer many of the normative challenges of early adolescence.<br/><br/>The research has the potential to be significant in three ways. First, the research can offer transformative ways to think about the meaning and measurement of racial/ethnic diversity. The emerging view of racial/ethnic diversity as a dynamic, multi-dimensional construct can be useful for research in other social settings -- including the neighborhood or workplace -- where the implications of increasing ethnic diversity are a primary concern. Second, the project has the potential to contribute new knowledge about the psychosocial challenges of normative development during early adolescence by focusing on the ways in which ethnically diverse school settings can buffer some of those challenges. Unlike other programs of developmental research, this project conceptualizes school diversity as a protective factor. Third, the research has implications for social policies affecting youth. By making a case for the ways in which diverse schools contribute to the academic and social well-being of all students, the results can contribute to the discourse on legal options for achieving greater racial/ethnic diversity in our nation's urban public schools."

The Arabidopsis genome contains at least 2,000 such domains. Different types of lipid signals target the domains to different cellular membranes. The interaction of lipid-binding domains with membrane surfaces is an essential part of their function. This project aims to understand, at the molecular level, how these domains are recruited to different cellular membranes and how proteins and lipid signals are organized laterally at membrane surfaces and, thus, regulate cellular processes. Function will be determined at the family and genome levels through the synthesis of computational and experimental analyses. An automated high-throughput comparative modeling pipeline will detect new instances of lipid-binding domains in the Arabidopsis genome and predict the structures of their amino acid sequences using known structures as templates. The biophysical properties of these models will be calculated and the functional predictions will be tested through the interpretation and rational design of experiments. Ultimately, detailed models of the physical interactions underlying lipid signaling pathways at membrane surfaces will be built in collaboration with experiment. This project reflects all three of the current 2010 Project focus activities: 1) Benchmarking gene function. Genes from Arabidopsis will be quantitatively compared with genes from other, much more annotated model organisms. 2) Developing genome-wide tools for analyzing gene function: The comparative modeling pipeline, which is highly modular, is the framework for a comprehensive tool that allows for the inclusion of new computational methods to facilitate both larger scale and more detailed annotation of gene function. 3) Exploring exemplary networks and systems: The results for individual lipid-binding domains will be leveraged to model how proteins and lipids collaborate to transduce cellular signaling.

Siegel will conduct a three-year study study of Hawai'i Creole English (HCE). Locally known as ""Pidgin,"" this creole language arose among the multi-ethnic immigrant work force on sugar plantations in Hawai'I, and is currently spoken by approximately 600,000 people. The aims of the project are twofold. The first is to describe the grammatical features of modern HCE as well as linguistic variation, both in its current use and over time. The second aim is to examine the external influences on the development of the language. These include the original languages of the plantation workers (especially Hawaiian, Portuguese, Cantonese and Japanese), as well as those of more recent immigrants to Hawai'i (such as Tagalog and Ilocano). The project will create two computer databases for analysis. The written database will include published literature using the language from the last three decades. The spoken database will include transcriptions of recordings of speakers made by HCE-speaking fieldworkers hired and trained for the project. The sources of spoken data will be of two types: recordings of a wide range of speakers telling stories, and longer recordings of a few members of two different social groups, one in an immigrant community, done over longer periods of time. In addition, follow-up recordings will be made of speakers who were previously recorded by other researchers in 1975 and 1989. This will allow an investigation of the changes that have taken place in the speech of individuals as well as in the language as a whole.<br/><br/>The findings of this project will have both theoretical and practical significance. First, it has been claimed that HCE shows very little influence from other languages and that, rather, it reflects universal linguistic characteristics that are part of human genetic endowment. In fact, HCE is often referred to as evidence of an innate mental faculty for language. Findings from this project will be used to critically examine these claims. Second, like other creole languages, HCE has a continuum of varieties ranging from those most different from the language which provided the bulk of the vocabulary (English, in the case of HCE), to those most similar to it. For decades sociolinguists have been arguing about whether this kind of continuum results from individuals changing their speech in their lifetimes or whether it reflects generational changes in the speech community. This project will examine the longitudinal data (from 1975 to the present) to throw some light on this question. The project will also have practical significance for educational policies. Educators have blamed HCE for poor results in national tests of reading and writing. Special educational programs for HCE speakers have been conducted in the past, attempting to use the students' own language as a bridge to standard English. But a major problem has been the lack of a resource for teachers providing general information about current HCE. This project will produce such a resource, and will also disseminate information through a non-technical web site and teacher workshops."

This project will develop and test general models that can be applied to a particular sequence of wetland agricultural change in the Hawaiian Islands. This project will be focused on Wailau Valley, located on the remote windward coast of Molokai. Here, a series of intact irrigated agricultural terraces are distributed across a 936-hectare valley. Abandoned nearly 100 years ago, Wailau offers a pristine and well-preserved wet valley that has not been previously studied. This work explores the roles of geographic expansion and intensification in the development of traditional agriculture in Hawaii. <br/><br/>Two models are created that describe wetland agricultural development: the first, in which locations for farming are chosen in relation to achieving maximum agricultural output; and the second, in which farmers first selected low-risk areas that required the least amount of work to cultivate and later moved to areas that would require a greater labor investment for farming. This research will involve mapping the wetland agricultural systems, conducting archaeological excavations, developing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data bases, analyzing nutrient levels in natural and cultivated soils, and radiocarbon dating. <br/><br/>One season of fieldwork has been successfully completed, 12.5 hectares of the valley were surveyed, and nearly 100 agricultural terraces were mapped. A number of terraces were excavated and charcoal was collected for radiocarbon dating. Initial dates obtained thus far hint at a pattern of agricultural development in which side drainages deep in the valley were exploited as early as the 13th Century A.D., long before cultivation of the flat low-lying expanses along the major streams. These latter areas may have been colonized as late as the 19th Century. These preliminary results support the second model of agricultural development, as the smaller side drainages contain rejuvenated soils from slope erosion, require less effort to build terraces and cultivate wetland crops such as taro, and are less prone to the risk of flooding.<br/><br/>An integral part of this research is the involvement of Molokai residents. A number of residents have completed an archaeological training program taught by McElroy in 2005. The program was designed to create sustainable employment opportunities for the residents of Molokai who have one of the highest rates of unemployment in the state. The course consisted of introductory classroom and field instruction in the Spring of 2005, and an advanced archaeological field course during the Summer of 2005 in Wailau. Enlisting graduates of this program to assist with this research broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in archaeology, as Molokai is home to a high percentage of Native Hawaiian and multi-ethnic residents.<br/><br/>The study of agricultural development by archaeologists is one area in which the findings have potential import not only for historical sciences but for the contemporary world. The factors that promoted increased agricultural production in the past, such as technological and genetic innovations, are relevant today. The degree to which agricultural systems were sustainable in the past may also offer clues to understanding how contemporary farming can be maintained without excessive environmental damage."

The dataset will consist of over 40,000 fossil animal bones that date to >70,000 (Blombos), and >181,000 (PP 13B). Thompson's study will determine what proportions of the collections represent the food remains from human inhabitants rather than residue from other bone accumulators such as carnivores, rodents, and raptors. Once this is determined, the hunting and butchering strategies of these people can be inferred from marks left on the bones: cut marks from removing meat and percussion marks from extracting marrow. <br/><br/>Both sites date to a time known as the Middle Stone Age (MSA), from ca. 250 to ca. 30 thousand years ago (ka). This is a critical period in human evolution because, although the skeletal remains dating to this time are physically modern, it is not clear if these humans behaved as modern people do. Recent discoveries of carved pigments and personal ornaments from Blombos have shown that creativity and symbolic behavior was present in our species at least 70,000, but the relationship between these factors and diet remains unknown. Work on this problem has been seriously hindered by a lack of empirical data: in all of Southern Africa only one other collection from this time period has been comprehensively analyzed and published. Thompson's study will create two new datasets that can be directly compared to this one (DK 1), thus effectively tripling the empirical record for faunal collections that are complete and have been fully analyzed. For the first time, behavioral comparisons can be made between sites with abundant evidence for symbolic behavior (Blombos) and with less such evidence (PP 13B and DK 1).<br/><br/>The methodology contains a heavy emphasis on proper curation of the faunal remains, so that future researchers can easily locate and examine any portion of the assemblages, including materials not used in this project (reptiles, birds, fish, etc.). Each specimen identifiable to element will be drawn into a Geographical Information System (GIS) database, creating a permanent digital record that can be shared instantaneously by researchers around the world.<br/><br/>Because of South African heritage laws, the data must be collected in Cape Town. This provides an opportunity for information be provided to the scientific and local communities in the country where the materials were discovered. Archaeological research into human behavior during this critical time period has the potential to identify and illustrate which behavioral aspects all modern humans share. This has particularly significant implications for a newly integrated multiracial and multiethnic country such as South Africa. As the study proceeds, Thompson will present information to middle and high school-aged students by participating in an outreach program organized by a colleague at the South African Museum. The program is designed to inform and excite, as well as to promote archaeological conservation to the future guardians of these irreplaceable resources."

Archaeologists identify Peru as one of the hearths of civilization and although the Inca, because they were observed and conquered by the Spanish, are the best known example from this region, they were the last in a succession of complex Andean societies. The Moche first appear as a recognizable group ca. 2,000 years ago on the arid northern coast of Peru and archaeologists can trace their development into a complex urban society over the span of almost 1,000 years. The Moche peoples were associated with the construction of pyramids and other monumental architecture and developed a highly centralized form of government. The origins of Moche civilization however are poorly understood and this process forms the basis for Mr. Attarian's research. Prior work both by Mr. Attarian and other investigators indicates that in immediate pre-Moche times small groups lived in defensible positions on the edge of the Moche Valley. Their subsequent aggregation on the valley floor itself marks the start of the Moche tradition. The particular question which Mr. Attarian wishes to answer concerns the mechanisms which developed to integrate previously independent groups into a single cohesive urban unit. To address this question he will study ceramics and other remains from 6 pre-Moche villages and then compare these with materials recovered from Mocollope, an early Moche center. His preliminary work has shown that while ceramics styles from each of the precursor villages are similar and constitute part of a single tradition, individual villages had specific design elements which made their pottery unique. Mr. Attarian will conduct additional excavation at each of these villages to define individual styles more precisely. He will then collect surface ceramics from Mocollope and excavate in selected areas. With these data he should be able to determine whether these styles continue at Mocollope and are spatially segregated within the site - an indication of ""barrios"" and continued multi-ethnic groups - or whether they are replaced by a pan-city style. Through the use of ceramics and other material remains he will also examine the rise of social/wealth differentiation and how this interacts with ethnicity.<br/><br/>This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase understanding of the rise of complex societies and assist in training a promising young scientist."

Fort Ross was founded in 1812 by the Russian-American Company, a mercantile monopoly that represented Russia's interests in the lucrative North Pacific fur trade. The fort served as a staging area for sea otter and fur seal hunts along the coast of California and as an agricultural community for raising crops and livestock. It remained in the hands of the Russian-American company until 1841 when it was disbanded and the land sold. Fort Ross was a multiethnic community and included Russians as well as a sizeable contingent of Alaskan Aleut Indians who were imported to hunt. Finally, local Pomo Indians were also associated with the Fort and performed a number of tasks. The goal of Dr. Lightfoot's research is to understand the ethnic interactions which took place and to gain insight into how acculturation occurred. To accomplish this, he will continue archaeological excavation with a focus on the inter-ethnic areas of the site where, documents indicate, mixed- group families lived. Pomo women married both Russian and Aleut men. Dr. Lightfoot will clear large areas to reveal individual households. He will analyze artifacts collected to determine the degree of cultural syncretism which took place. Through use of survey, documents sources and both Pomo and Aleut informants, he will also attempt to reconstruct the larger settlement pattern and cultural landscape. Culture contact and change are dominant forces in today's world as even the most remote areas are drawn into global interaction and economic systems. Anthropologists wish to understand the processes by which cultural accommodation and assimilation take place and the New World, because of its large size and its relatively recent contact with the Old has proven a fertile ground for such investi gations. Dr. Lightfoot notes that researchers have tended to work with simple models which posit direct contact between Europeans and a single Native American group. In fact, the reality was often more complicated since exposure was often mediated by other Indian societies. Fort Ross provides an excellent example and through a detailed examination Dr. Lightfoot hopes to determine how mediated change, with Aleuts as intermediaries, took place. This research is important for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of inter-ethnic interaction and the process of culture change. It will shed new light on California's early history and assist in the training of several graduate students. ***"

However, in today's multiethnic, multiracial, culturally diverse society, another factor that may influence academic achievement for ethnic minority young people is their perceptions of discrimination in U.S. society. Discrimination likely influences orientation toward school and subsequently academic achievement. This research is grounded in the disciplines of adolescent development and social psychology. Two facets of particular interest in this study include better understanding factors influencing adolescents' perceptions of discrimination and subsequent thinking about how to respond to racial discrimination. <br/><br/>This project has three goals: (1) to develop a clear understanding of how adolescents' understand and think about perceived discrimination that they may likely encounter at school and outside of school using developed quantitative measures and through development of qualitative interviews; (2) to disseminate the results to a national audience through peer-reviewed documents and presentations and including undergraduate and graduate research assistants in national conference participation, presentations, and publications; and (3) to create a viable and sustainable research and mentorship program within the Interdisciplinary Program in Child Development at California State University, Northridge. This program will mentor and train underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in social science research skills and critical thinking through multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to understanding ethnic minority adolescents' development using a multi-tiered approach. This program will ultimately assist in preparing future minority child & adolescent development scientists for application into M.A. and Ph.D. programs."

Students from the Host and Affiliate Institutions, (Texas State UniversitySan Marcos, University of Texas at San Antonio, University of Texas Pan American, and Brigham Young University) begin preparing for summer fieldwork in Guatemala by completing courses in Anthropological Research Methods and Latin American Area Studies. Students and faculty from all four institutions will meet regularly via ITV/VC (Interactive Television Videoconference) to plan and prepare for the summer program and develop a viable research project. During the ten weeks in Guatemala, students will live with a local Maya family and engage in various forms of data collection, including participant observation, interviewing, surveys, and focus groups. In addition, students will complete readings and other activities with the program faculty, and will receive nine hours of upperdivision credit in Anthropology for the summer. After the summer program, students will continue to work with faculty to produce publications and presentations. The program trains ethnographic researchers and provides handson experience with fieldwork and research methods in a supervised environment. Social scientists in many disciplines are increasingly relying on ethnographic research methods, but few students have received the opportunity to implement the methods or experience the rigors of fieldwork in a foreign environment. Students also have the opportunity to produce publications and conference presentations documenting Maya life and social change within Guatemala. A central goal of the program is to generate undergraduate researchers who can produce quality research and publications, and prepare students, especially first generation and underrepresented minorities, for graduate school and social science research careers. It also helps students understand the social, cultural, and political dynamics in multiethnic nationstates that are fraught with poverty and social conflict."

The project will serve 50 students annually from three target schools. This four-week commuter project will provide unique learning experiences in mathematics and science to encourage the students to continue the study of math and science, to realize the importance of these subjects in their everyday lives and appreciate that both are interesting and enjoyable. The summer project has three modules: I) Knowing the course-work; II) Knowing yourself; and III) Knowing the school system. The content for mathematics will be geometry, measurement, statistics, probability, ratio, proportion, and algebra. The content for science will be ecology, environmental geology and mineralogy. Instructional activities are hands-on, independent study, intensive lab use, work stations, and field trips. Problem-solving, communication, reasoning, and connection will provide students with the conditions for learning mathematics and science. An evaluation plan with measurable outcomes will allow the project to make necessary changes. Community and institutional support are strong. ***"

""Tunbao"" refers to the culture of some 300,000 descendants of Ming Dynasty garrison settlers stationed on the empire's southwestern frontier during the 14th century. Having lived in relative isolation for some six centuries, these villagers are now regarded as ""living fossils"" of early Ming culture, an ambivalent label that villagers themselves have nevertheless appropriated and turned into a mark of cultural prestige. This research project will evaluate the development of Tunbao-based heritage tourism in southwest China's Guizhou province. The project will assess the relationship between cultural strategies of development and local reactions to and incorporations of such strategies in the local-scale pursuit of tourism development. This two-year collaborative ethnographic case study will bring together a multi-ethnic and interdisciplinary research team, and it will introduces innovative theories and methodologies in human geography to Chinese scholars and graduate students. The project specifically seeks to address three general questions: (1) How is local culture used as a resource in regional development strategies? (2) What is the relationship between cultural strategies of regional development and the reinvention of local culture? (3) What role do locals play in the reinvention of local culture and what meanings are associated with such reinvention? Research methods to me used include interviews with local and provincial government officials at units most directly responsible for formulating regional development strategies, external trade and financial ties, and cultural development and preservation; a comprehensive inventory of contemporary changes in tunbao cultural reinvention; village surveys; extended open-ended interviews; and participant-observation of village cultural landscapes, visual cultural practices, and performances.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to broader theoretical work in the human geography of China. It will contribute a Chinese perspective toward western ideas and experiences of ""place marketing"" and cultural change as well as provide a model for sustainable heritage tourism development in rural China. The project will integrate research and education while seeking to benefit society at large. The project will help train four Chinese graduate students in innovative field methods and theoretical approaches to understanding cultural change and economic development. The project also seeks to provide a basis for a dialogue between Chinese scholars and local government officials and tourism industry personnel."

By focusing on social relationships in an integrated neighborhood, we move beyond traditional studies of segregation research that use segregation indices, such as the dissimilarity index. Additionally, this study examines how the concept of social distance, which highlights social interaction between groups, may explain the quantity and quality of encounters between black, white, and Latino residents. This project will assess the social environment of an integrated neighborhood by documenting and questioning the attitudes, behaviors, and relationships of neighborhood residents. These data will be collected through neighborhood observations, in-depth interviews with residents, and a neighborhood-wide survey. Lastly, data will be analyzed using modified grounded theory, a process that uses data and existing theory to develop concepts and new theories (Charmaz 2006). <br/><br/>The proposed analysis addresses two major limitations of segregation research: two group comparisons (e.g. black-white) and Census data-based analyses (Ellen 1998). By studying neighborhood life in an integrated neighborhood through the proposed research design, this study highlights an element absent from cross-city comparisons: people. Furthermore, since this research is taking place in a new destination for Latino migration, it emphasizes the experience of recently migrated Latinos (Parrado and Flippen 2005). How Latino residents are incorporated and understood by their neighbors, as well as how migrants understand their own experiences inside this neighborhood are of particular interest. The recent arrival of Latin American migrants provides an opportunity to see how an area with an existing racial dynamic adjusts to the introduction of a new group (Kim 1999). <br/><br/>Additionally, Durham's population shifts from a biracial to a multi-ethnic city parallel demographic changes in other growing American cities. Studying this experience is essential to understanding the future of immigration and segregation in this country (Hirschman and Massey 2008:3). <br/><br/>Lastly, Federal programs like HOPE VI, a Public and Indian Housing program promoting mixed-income communities, follow in the tradition of sociological research on integration (US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Home and Communities; Wilson 1987) and may benefit from the proposed project's findings. <br/><br/>Broader Impact.

However, studies that link ethnic identification to ethnic conflict tend to treat the former as a simple attribute, equally present for all members of an ethnic group. This approach is questionable, for it ignores social and individual variation and fails to address sufficiently the conditions under which ethnic identities are engendered. Consequently, we have only a superficial account of the link between identity and conflict. This doctoral dissertation research will address these deficiencies by examining the conditions under which ethnic identities become salient and the role two key social attributes, class and gender, play in this process. Relevant data for assessing these issues will be collected in a survey on ethnic identity in Mauritius, a strategic site for examining these phenomena. Results from the study should provide a better understanding of the conditions under which strong ethnic identification occurs and its potential for ethnic conflict."

Through her doctoral dissertation research under the direction of Drs. Jones and Georges, she plans to examine the conceptualizations of tradition that emerge from the judicial process and the relationship such conceptualizations have to ethnographic reality. Specifically, Ms. Evans-Pritchard focuses on the ""Portal Case,"" a highly controversial lawsuit in which an Anglo craftsman challenged the Indian-only policy of Santa Fe's traditional Indian market. She compares the Portal Case with five recent court cases in various parts of the country which have involved similar issues of tradition and ethnic or cultural boundaries in order to operationalize the process by which the formal legal apparatus is currently handling the informal social force of tradition. A key element of her work is to establish the ethnographic context of three related New Mexico cases, including the Portal Case, involving Native American arts and crafts in order to illuminate the relationship between the codified conceptualizations of tradition expressed in the court proceedings and the imbedded views of tradition held by the affected Native American craftsmen. Through systematic, comparative analysis of diverse sources of data, this project holds substantial promise of advancing our understanding of how courts and litigants construct boundaries around cultural or ethnic groups."

It compares how the movements invoke their identity to justify demands for land, territory, and political autonomy -- rights that are crucial to indigenous citizenship and that, when granted, can dramatically alter power relations and the locus of state authority. Bolivia's indigenous movement politicizes its identity to justify demands for ""territory"" and ""autonomy""; their Guatemalan counterparts, by contrast, demand land redistribution and focus on building ""local power"" within community government. In both countries, indigenous people are a historically marginalized and racialized majority, and the challenge of including them as full citizens of the state is tremendous. Why do the Bolivian and Guatemalan indigenous movements respond to this challenge in such different ways, and how can we explain their differing demands? I propose that political opportunities and institutions interact with indigenous identity to produce the different demands -- and different politicizations of identity -- in the Bolivian and Guatemalan movements. Using data from semi-structured interviews, observations, and documents, I will reconstruct the processes of demand-making through the local and national level experiences of major indigenous social movement organizations in each country. The findings will contribute to theory on social movements and identity politics, and will reveal the socio-political factors that lead to very different ways of reconfiguring citizenship in multi-ethnic and racially polarized democracies. Additionally, the results of the study will carry important practical implications by investigating indigenous movement agency in influencing multicultural rights policies, which are debated in both national and international arenas."

Convincing evidence from studies conducted throughout the last five decades demonstrates that residential segregation denies blacks many opportunities generally available to urban whites. Massey and Denton argue that residential segregation created and now perpetuates an urban underclass in many large cities. Although there were modest declines in black-white segregation in the 1980s; the primary impression gained from examining recent investigations of population distribution based on census data is the persistence of segregation despite changes in federal laws and improvements in the social and economic status of African-Americans. Analyses of the individual level factors acting to sustain this segregation are both rare and inconclusive. Many of these have focused on one metropolis, Detroit, and on the beliefs and preferences of whites only. The present study engages the central theoretical issues with fresh data that largely overcome these limitations. This project presents a conceptual model of the causes of continued segregation emanating from Myrdal's observation that informal social pressures are the primary forces sustaining the geographic isolation of blacks from whites. The model posits that the beliefs individuals hold about their own group and about other racial groups influence their perceptions of which neighborhoods are attractive and which should be avoided. With an innovative data set, the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality (MCSUI), the research will test hypotheses about the beliefs and preferences of samples of blacks and whites in four sites (Atlanta, Boston, Detroit and Los Angeles), samples of Latinos in two (Boston and Los Angeles) and a sample of Asians in Los Angeles. The abundance of relevant variables allows testing the model in two ways. First, the research will examine how characteristics and beliefs influence respondents' preferences for living in hypothetical neighborhoods with varying racial compositi ons. For example, are whites who hold stereotypical beliefs about blacks less likely to remain in their neighborhoods when blacks move in, and are they unwilling to move into already integrated neighborhoods? Second, respondents were asked to evaluate the desirability of living in specific locations such as suburbs or well-known neighborhoods within the central city. If blacks anticipate hostility from the residents of a particular suburb, do they also view it as an undesirable place to live despite the presence of affordable housing there? By asking such questions this research will address how individuals' beliefs and preferences translate into the multitude of locational decisions that determine the residential distributions of blacks and whites. The unique structure of the MCSUI data set also allows the research to investigate whether similar dynamics are likely to affect the residential distributions of Hispanics and Asians who are now entering our increasingly diverse metropolises."

Research on transnational immigrants (those whose patterns of living transcend the boundaries of any one nation) has called into question the use of assimilation theory to describe contemporary immigrant incorporation. Research on the children of immigrants has gone further to suggest that assimilation compromises immigrant psychological and physical health. Using random survey methods, the research studies the modes of incorporation of recent, post-1986, Latin American immigrants in South Florida. The Institute for Public Opinion Research (IPOR) at Florida International University will conduct a phone survey of a sample of 1200 immigrants. Data will be collected to address the issue of to what extent (if any) immigrant integration has taken on a transnational character, meaning that immigrants both assimilate to some aspects of American culture while continuing to be involved in their home countries. Links between particular modes of integration (e.g. bi-national integration versus other forms of assimilation such as segmented assimilation and selective acculturation) and immigrants' subjective assessment of their well-being will also be examined. Given the increase in the numbers of immigrants coming to the United States and the growing diversity in terms of their social origins, the research will provide important insights into the extent of continued involvement in home societies and whether such involvement, 1) deters or encourages integration to U.S. society; and, 2) if a particular mode of incorporation ameliorates the adverse impact of U.S. struggles documented by previous researchers who have argued that assimilation jeopardizes the health of immigrants. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research provides a research experience for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of South Florida and William Paterson University. The data will be integrated into courses to expand students' methodological skills as well as their understandings of immigration as a substantive area of study in Sociology. The data collected from this project will be made available to undergraduate and graduate students at participating universities for use in theses and dissertations. Moreover, the project increases the participation of historically underrepresented groups in research (all three of the researchers are Hispanic/Latina). The study's findings will shed new light on how new immigrants are integrating into established immigrant communities and what particular modes of integration most enhance immigrant subjective well-being. These findings have policy implications, particularly as immigration continues to be a highly contested topic of legislative debate."

The district lies at the extreme eastern end of a semi-arid deeply incised river valley in the northernmost highlands of Ecuador at approximately 1600 meters above sea level. The drainage is one of the few that breach the western cordillera to empty into the sea and thus it occupies an unusual and important geographic position. Ecuador, in common with other Andean countries, is characterized by three distinct physiographic zones. A dry Pacific coastal zone, a central mountainous region and an eastern lowland tropical rainforest. Because of their close proximity and the fact that each zone contains unique and valuable resources, archaeologists have focused on the political and economic strategies employed by prehistoric peoples and attempted to determine the extent and nature of trade and interaction across these areas. A series of states and empires arose in many parts of this broad region and scientists wish to understand the extent to which the desire and need to control resources from several zones played a role. It is in this context that Drs. Bray and Landazuri's research is important. Because of its highland position and its easy connection to both Pacific coast as well an Amazonian lowlands, Pimampiro provides an excellent venue to examine the extent and nature of interaction. Using a three pronged approach the researchers plan to examine regional networks of exchange. Although a prehistoric state did not arise in Pimampiro the investigators believe that extensive tans-zonal interaction took place. They will conduct archaeological excavation, examine extensive early Spanish descriptions of the region and analyze botanical remains recovered from prehistoric features. On the basis of preliminary survey, they have decided to focus attention on the site of Shanshipampa. Located on an alluvial terrace of the river valley, the site's most notable feature is a large rectangular stone pavement 31 meters long by 6 meters wide. The pavement contains sculpted motifs which indicate close ties with the eastern lowlands. Two adjacent carved stone monuments contain images of monkeys and snakes suggestive of tropical lowland fauna. Through excavation of both agricultural surfaces and house mounds it should be possible to determine the crops produced (and whether they served as trade goods) and also the ethnicity of the inhabitants. On the basis of descriptions in ethnohistoric documents it is possible that lowland peoples resided in specific parts of the valley and the researchers wish to determine if this in fact occurred. This research is important for several reasons. It will help to fill an important geographic gap in the archaeological record and provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also provide insight into the large scale inter-regional subsistence adaptations."
