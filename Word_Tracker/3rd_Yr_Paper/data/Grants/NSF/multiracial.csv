The ""color line,"" once so clearly and indelibly drawn by the one-drop rule, is being redrawn by a putative multiracial community. We argue that this movement is comprised of multiple strands of action, oriented toward self-expression, family and state. Three issues in particular will be addressed: 1) the social conditions leading to the formation of the ""multiracial movement"", 2) whether or not a collective multiracial consciousness is developing, and 3) the motivations behind this activism. Hypotheses drawn from the insights of social movement research predict that the multiracial movement has emerged through the convergence of three critical factors: 1) political opportunities that have allowed agents to gain access to the political sphere, 2) an organizational base that allows groups to take advantage of those opportunities, and 3) framings of the experience of multiraciality that encourage more organization around the issue. Data will consist of a combination of interviews with the founders, leaders, and a sample of membership from multiracial organizations; archival research, demographic data, and fieldwork at events sponsored by multiracial organization. The study will provide needed systematic analysis of multiracial movement where none exists to date."

Multiracial Americans, especially black/white biracial Americans, are also increasingly visible in the public consciousness. Multiracial Americans may have personal, social, and/or cultural motivations to identify with and project different social and racial identities. Previous research has shown that the identity choices of multiracial Americans are often reflected in social practice though elements such as personal adornment and choice of friendship networks, but few scholars have examined the effects of these identity choices on linguistic practice. <br/><br/>This dissertation project investigates racial identity through the lens of language, examining how Millennial generation men (ages 18-32) with one black parent and one white parent project their racial identities in conversations with white and black peers. Under the direction of Dr. Renee Blake, Nicole Holliday will collect conversational speech samples under varying interview conditions from members of the study group, and will perform a set of phonetic analyses on the collected samples. The analyses will focus on the stylistic variation in their use of certain suprasegmental features, such as intonation and rhythm, which appear to differ between African American English and Mainstream U.S. English. These features include the use of Fundamental Frequency (F0) range (including falsetto phonation), peak delay, and the number of pitch accents in comparable utterances. Understanding how these features work in style-shifting is important because research has demonstrated that listeners rely on linguistic information to make racial judgments about speakers and that this type of linguistic profiling has tangible consequences: individuals are often denied housing, employment, or other types of opportunities. The results of this study will shed light on how linguistic features are used to perceive and to convey an individual's racial identity."

Social scientists understand little about how multi-ethnic, mixed-race households comprehend and enact racial and ethnic identity or about how they select and interact with their residential neighborhoods. Decisions about ""Where to Live?"" rank among the most important issues that confront mixed-race families because they must select residential locations from among a set of neighborhoods that are typically marked in terms of single racial categories. Neighborhoods shape potential social interactions and thus influence the formation and enactment of ethnic and racial identities within mixed-race households. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine one type of mixed-race household, couples including a non-Latino White (hereafter referred to as ""White"") and a Latino of Mexican heritage (hereafter referred to as ""Mexican"") in one metropolis, the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The doctoral student will examine the multi-scalar interactions of family and family members' racial and ethnic identity formation processes with household and neighborhood contexts. The study will employ a rigorous combination of tabular and cartographic quantitative analysis of geographically detailed confidential census data with qualitative analysis of residential history interviews with Mexican mothers and adult multiracial children from White-Mexican (WM) households. The project will (1) examine the residential distribution of WM households relative to other L.A. area households and characterize the racial identification of multiracial children in WM households relative to household demographic structure and neighborhood racial composition, (2) assess WM family-level perceptions and residential decisions related to the racial and ethnic socialization of children, and (3) evaluate the dual impacts of WM household and neighborhood contexts on the formation and expression of racial and ethnic identity among WM multiracial offspring.<br/><br/>This project will enhance understanding of racial and ethnic identity development by examining two of the multiple social settings (households and neighborhoods) that impact identity formation. This project conceives of the household as both a contextual social setting that affects individual identity and as a subjective unit of collective identity assertion, negotiation, and enactment. Similar analyses are largely absent in academia because of substantive foci upon individuals rather than households. Broader scientific impacts arise from the study's focus on WM households; a mixed-race household type that is far more common that other multiethnic and multiracial partnerships but that is also nearly ignored by researchers. WM households might retain elements of both partners' racial and ethnic identifications and the household's complex racial, and ethnic identity might manifest itself in family residential decisions that are similar to but quite distinct from those of most same-race White or Latino households. WM households might not gravitate towards residential neighborhoods that are dominated by members of either partner's racial group. This research will address the manner with which Latino cultures and racial identities blend into and/or alter those of White America and offer crucial empirical information about where mixed-race households settle within large metropolitan areas. Finally, as research funded by a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award, this implementation of this project will facilitate the establishment of a solid independent research program for a promising young scholar."

The effects of increased social interaction and of changing social and legal contexts on perceptions of and memory for individuals of other groups is a topic of perennial scholarly interest. The accuracy of cross- racial eyewitness identification is an important area of concern; yet, there is no consensus in the scholarly community about the psychological mechanisms which affect these judgments. This is an area in which there are interesting theoretical developments that have implications for both formal and informal interactions among people of different groups. This project is for a planning grant to facilitate development of a research project that will assess factors associated with global changes in racism, discrimination, and ethnic conflict. The project being planned will focus, in particular, on the effects of social structure, social experience, and attitudes on cross-racial identification in the Republic of South Africa as the legal system of apartheid or ""separateness"" is dismantled. At the core of the approach is the notion that the relative heterogeneity of the social resources afforded by a particular group will determine the ability of individuals to differentiate on the basis of facial and other appearance. The more homogeneously another race is viewed in social terms, the less likelihood of individual recognition. During this planning period the investigators will (1) establish a multi-national, multi-discipline, multi-racial research team that will participate in the research; (2) travel to South Africa to discuss research plans and study materials; and (3) develop a comprehensive plan for the subsequent research. This research addresses an important dimension of racial and social conflict and has specific implications for cross-racial eyewitness identification and reliability. The results of the study will enable revising existing theory to accommodate multicultural dimensions of racial bias. The research will also contribute to our understanding of broader issues of social perception."

Gatekeepers control access to ""benefits"" they do not own, benefits that are valued by ""clients."" Seeking access to those benefits, clients assume obligations which may be discharged by a fee paid to the gatekeeper. Employment agents, car salesmen, real estate agents are gatekeepers because they control access to jobs, cars and housing respectively as well as information about each. When clients are lower status, for example African American, employment agents may steer them to lower paid, less desirable jobs, car salesmen may ask for and receive higher prices, and real estate agents may show only segregated housing. This research will experimentally test the impact of racial status differences on gatekeeping. Do African American gatekeepers gain smaller fees from White clients? What happens when Whites are gatekeepers? Do African American clients pay higher fees for the access they seek? And what is the impact of the race of the person to whom clients seek access? These questions are important for both practical and theoretical reasons. The research findings will help us better understand the continuing effects of status differences and stratification on everyday life. <br/><br/>Multiracial gatekeeping is studied in the context of exchange networks. For example, B is the gatekeeper when an A - B exchange must be completed before A may exchange with C. B is the gatekeeper because A, acting in the role of client, must gain B's consent to exchange before gaining access to and exchanging with C. As a part of the research, a measure of the quantitative impact of race differences is developed, along with hypotheses drawn from that measure. The research uses a 2 x 2 x 2 (race of A, race of B, race of C) design to test hypotheses. Funded by the Digital Library Initiative at the National Science Foundation, ExNet will be used to produce exchange relations among actors. Subjects seated in separate rooms negotiate through connected PCs using only mouse control. ExNet shows the network being investigated as an active display on each subject's screen. Subjects click icons to make and reject offers and to complete exchanges. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>Findings will advance understandings of discriminatory practices in which power over racial minorities is grounded jointly in structure and status. Formal sociological theory is extended through new bridges between Network Exchange Theory and Status Characteristics Theory; perhaps the most extensively tested formal theories in sociology. More generally, results of will show how racially grounded status differences affect access to commodities that people value, potentially shedding light on one of the systemic, structural ways in which discrimination persists. While the research focuses on the impact of race on gatekeeping, the underlying theoretical process is not limited to racial status. It applies to any gatekeeping setting where ""status characteristic"" (identifiable attribute of individuals that carries with it cultural beliefs and/or evaluations of worthiness and competence) becomes salient. Gender, age, beauty and sexual orientation, for example, are all status characteristics, and when they become salient in a gatekeeper-client relationship, their effects should be the same as those predicted for racial status."

Dr. Yuichi Shoda of the University of Washington and his colleagues have evidence that this perception of race tends to be categorical. That is, people perceive ""race"" as White, Black, Asian, etc. but not as a continuum of variations. The issue of race has become quite salient during the 2008 U.S. Presidential elections. The Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, has been characterized by the media as both Black and as ""mixed race"" or ""multi-racial"" in that his mother is of European descent and his father is of African descent. It is possible that these portrayals and increased familiarity with Obama could potentially influence people's perception of race. Dr. Shoda and his team hypothesize that over the next four months, perceptions of racial categories may change in one of two ways: (1) people who see Obama as multiracial will further expand their racial category repertoire and shift away from black-white dichotomous categories toward a more continuous black-mixed-white continuum; and (2) people who see Obama as Black may shift their definitions of who is Black to include less Afrocentric (i.e., ""Whiter"") mixed-race individuals. Using an implicit categorization task reflecting patterns of errors in person recognition, these hypotheses will be tested, tracking the possible change in people's race perception during the 2008 election. The proposed research also provides a unique opportunity for assessing people's intuitive assumptions about race, as well as a new method for examining the processes through which people intuitively categorize other people."

The EEG technique itself involves placing surface electrodes on the scalp of a human participant and recording electrical signals generated by the brain in real-time, thereby allowing for a wide variety of analyses focused on the temporal localization of different brain signals. The system will enable this group to adopt an integrated model for understanding human behavior by blending traditional psychological methodology with functional neuroelectric activity in humans. <br/><br/>The scientists involved in this proposal are all active researchers from a broad range of disciplines including cognitive, perceptual, and social psychology. Five research projects (each consisting of several studies) are proposed. Project 1 uses machine learning for the classification of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to investigate the time course of the brain's recognition and categorization of complex visual scenes in order to understand how such representations guide actions in different environments. Project 2 examines how biases in perception of novel social categories (e.g., multiracial groups), as well as individual differences in opposition to equality, contribute to the perpetuation of group-based social inequality (e.g., racial inequality). It will use event related potentials (ERPs) to explore how social motivations (e.g., anti-egalitarianism) and social contexts (e.g., economic progress for ethnic minorities) influence the way people react to multiracial individuals. Project 3 proposes to combine EEG frequency band power analyses with behavioral paradigms in order to establish a more direct and conclusive indicator of whether encoding or retrieval based memory processes determine the impact of changing task demands on development of expertise. Project 4 investigates how social power evokes self-deception and, as a consequence, enhances persuasive abilities. Specifically, the project combines traditional behavioral measures with ERP analysis to trace the timing of brain signals that selectively unleash changes in awareness. In essence, it aims to elucidate how lying to others may begin with lying to the self. Project 5 will utilize ERPs to explore whether embodied language instruction (i.e., speech, gesture, facial expression, eye gaze, etc.) is effective for inducing neural changes in second-language (L2) learning in two different contexts: face-to-face versus online instruction. The project will focus on components that reflect early perceptual and late semantic processes in the learning of novel speech sounds and new words.<br/><br/>A shared EEG system at Colgate will allow this group to directly engage their students in laboratory techniques that unite psychology and neuroscience into one cohesive field of study, thereby fostering non-traditional research connections that should spur fresh insights and creative new areas of study. Such an approach will no doubt yield students who are better prepared for graduate research labs at an early stage (most undergraduates at other schools will not have this sort of highly technical experience), thereby guaranteeing the rapid advancement of the broader field of science. Lastly, the majority of psychology and neuroscience concentrators at Colgate are female, and the enhanced training made possible by a shared EEG system will therefore increase the competitive representation of women pursuing advanced degrees in a STEM field."

The psychometric properties of the existing racial attitude measures for children in this age group are problematic, which has served to limit the interdisciplinary understanding of racial prejudice. One fundamental limitation of existing racial attitude measures is that all employ a two-option, forced-choice response format to measure attitudes. Forced-choice formats confound conceptually distinct phenomena, such as ingroup preference and outgroup disparagement. To disentangle this confound, the project will employ a multi-item response format. The primary objectives of this project are: (1) to establish the reliability and validity the racial attitudes instrument and (2) to assess the profiles of young children's attitudes toward Black and White racial groups. Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing (ACASI) will be the modality through which the instrument is delivered. ACASI is an innovative method that enhances data quality and data collection procedures. The racial attitudes index will employ a picture-story approach to assess children's racial attitudes. The instrument will display a set of 28 photographic images of Black and White children. The photographic images will represent children in racially mixed pairs as a voice over reads mini stories about each image. A total of 360 subjects will participate in formative and evaluative activities.<br/><br/>The results of this project will be used to construct another ACASI measure called the Interracial and Ethnic Attitudes Index (IREAX). The IREAX will be designed for five-to-nine-year-olds and will use photographic images of targets from several racial and ethnic groups (e.g., Asian, Black, Latino, Native American, and White). To date, limited research has examined attitudes across and toward multiple racial and ethnic groups. The concentrated focus on attitudes toward Black and White racial groups limits the understanding of attitudes toward other racial and ethnic groups. The data from the RAI and IREAX should advance the understanding of the contours of racial bias. Childhood is the time in which racial attitudes are most malleable. Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of children's attitudes for the development of educational and policy interventions. The aims of this study should assist in efforts to ameliorate societal tensions surrounding race and ethnicity. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

The project aims to contribute to our comprehension of the changing dynamics in American suburbs, in order to foster mutual understanding between minority banks and mainstream society, and to provide policy suggestions concerning banking and community development. On the theoretical level, the work will examine the trajectory and structure of a particular minority-banking sector from a geographical perspective, and to contribute to the ""Geography of Money and Finance."" On the methodological front, the project will utilize multiple data sources and multi-faceted analyses, while combining quantitative and qualitative methods. It will test the validity of bank data collection for geographical research and the utility of qualitative research in banking analysis, notably interview and participatory methods. The analyses of publicly available data sources such as FDIC and HMDA, on the other hand, will yield a replicable method that can be applied to the study of other groups and localities. Also it will broaden the impacts through interdisciplinary connections, cross-university and multinational collaborations, and academic, banking, community, and public sector cooperation. There may be implications for changes in banking regulation and public policy within the study area in particular and within multiethnic urban America in general. The project will have a number of outcomes. It will begin with papers delivered at academic conferences at regional, national, and international levels, followed by research articles submitted to scholarly journals, both geography and interdisciplinary, chapter(s) in an edited volume on ethnic banking in Southern California, and a research report made available for all interested parties. Finally, there will be an opinion article targeted at the general public and a videotape clip to be circulated to both Chinese and mainstream mass media, in order to draw attention to the issues of minority banks and community development. This POWRE project will allow Li to initiate a fresh line of inquiry and to re-establish the foundation of her research following a career interruption. A section of the research program will be truly exploratory in nature, particularly regarding the unconventional data sources used. This research will lay the groundwork for future comparative studies of the ethnoburb phenomenon from a financial-dynamics perspective and contribute to a career goal of developing a conceptual framework of understanding and examining changing American suburbs."

PRISM activities are built on a foundation of past work in the state that emphasizes a preK-16 approach to education. PRISM seeks to increase science and mathematics achievement by providing challenging science and mathematics curricula for all students; raising public awareness of the need for all students to complete the challenging curricula; increasing and sustaining the number, quality and diversity of preK-12 teachers of science and mathematics; and increasing the responsiveness of higher education to the needs of schools. The PRISM partner school districts enroll over 170,000 students and employ over 10,000 elementary through high school teachers of science and mathematics. Within the school districts, 39% of the students are African American, 54% are White, 1% are Asian American, 5% are Hispanic, and 1% are Multiracial.<br/><br/>To increase student achievement, PRISM emphasizes changes in educational practice at all levels of four regional preK-16 partnerships and works to transform state policies to help the regional and local reform efforts gain traction and expand. In particular, PRISM institutionalizes professional networks and learning communities within which educators examine student work and best practices in science and mathematics education. Knowledge from this work, then, is shared, refined and used to develop the capacity of current and future preK-12 teachers. Through an Institute on the Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics, higher education faculty who prepare teachers work to change their pedagogical practices, which will help teachers deepen their understanding of science and/or mathematics. By including key state entities, PRISM also influences the statewide policy environment in order to reinforce local changes aimed at ensuring implementation of higher standards. While focused on the regional partnerships, it is hoped that innovations deriving from PRISM will impact the entire Georgia P-16 Network (15 regional school/university partnerships) and, through the MSP Learning Network, the Nation."

Currently, the Office of Management and Budget's Directive 15 governs the collection not only of census data but of all federal data concerning race and ethnicity. Over the last several years that directive has come under increasing scrutiny. Some argue that new categories, such as a `multiracial` category, ought to be added; others propose changing the names of certain categories; and some suggest scrapping the entire racial/ethnic classification scheme. The considerable research under way focuses on empirical questions, such as how various groups understand and use the descriptors. However, the relevance of this research for proposed revisions requires an understanding also of the ethical, conceptual, and methodological issues underlying racial and ethnic classification. This project will analyze these issues and consider their significance for competing schemes. One set of issues concerns ethical and policy choices, such as whether the harms of past classification schemes are best redressed by preserving, refining, or eliminating them. Answering this question requires an examination of the significance of racial and ethnic identity and of the legitimacy of the purposes served by racial classification. Demographic research needs raise another set of problems, including the requirement of comparability between past classification schemes and future ones, the issue of measurement effects -- how and to what extent different classification schemes may affect what is measured, and the role and significance of self reports in data collection. The research is a collaboration between philosophers, a lawyer-social psychologist, and a demographer. Each will lead a different aspect of the research, which will employ the methods of moral philosophy, philosophy of science, legal analysis and demography. Among the products of the research will be a memorandum submitted to OMB, a series of papers to be published in appropriate journals including public policy journals, and an anthology."

Since the vast majority of biologically active molecules are nitrogenous, this research will create new opportunities for the identification of biologically active molecules. Synthetic molecules are being tested for their ability to serve as pharmaceutical lead compounds, biological probes, and selective inhibitors of cellular proteins. Researchers contributing to this work represent a diverse multiracial, multicultural, multi-gender group of scientists. Professor Beaudry supervises formal weekly and monthly research meetings where scientists are trained for experimentation and dissemination of the work. Moreover, the diverse Beaudry group actively participates in community outreach and lifelong learning with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, ""Science Pub,"" a locally-organized discussion of science, and organization of the Pacific Northwest Undergraduate Research Symposium.<br/><br/>More technically, the project focuses on study and development of new chemical reactions of carbon-centered radicals that bear two nitrogen atoms. Such aminal radicals are used to create new carbon-carbon bonds in molecules containing heteroatoms, such as pharmaceuticals and natural products. The use of these radicals allows efficient syntheses of target molecules while avoiding acid-base chemistry of nitrogen, and as such represents a new strategy for chemical synthesis."

The research team proposes that judicial protection of minorities can emerge as an unintended by-product of majoritarian politics. Popular majorities support judicial review because courts benefit majorities by protecting them against ""corrupt"" or ""captured"" legislatures. Researchers test this theory using a controlled experiment that assesses whether respondents? evaluations of the US Supreme Court relative to the Congress are changed by reports of congressional corruption, news of judicial decisions that conform to subjects? preferences, or an interaction of these two treatments.<br/><br/>The proposed research is valuable for scholars of political development and institutional design, especially in democracies with multiracial and multiethnic societies.

In a pattern at variance with the past, racial and ethnic minorities are increasingly found in the suburbs of metropolitan areas, rather than their central cities. This project addresses the significance of this trend by studying the suburbanization patterns for a wide range of racial/ethnic groups in five major metropolitan areas. The study goes well beyond past research on suburbanization by focusing on differences among the suburban places to which different groups gain access. It also examines differences within major racial/ethnic categories (for instance, between the Chinese and Japanese among Asians). The analysis will investigate how minority-group members attain residence in places with characteristics that affect positively the quality of life and life chances of their residents. The investigators will estimate models that view locational outcomes as a function of the socioeconomic, assimilation, and life-cycle characteristics of individuals, and will test whether these models vary by ethnic group and across metropolitan areas. Further, the investigators will analyze the ability of individuals to ""convert"" their socioeconomic and assimilation characteristics into favorable residenti allocations."

These shifts in demographic and socioeconomic contexts portend tremendous flux in control of urban politics and policy. While the study of race and representation in urban America has a long history, several key questions remain either unanswered or only partly addressed. For example, how do electoral structures (voting methods, term limits, legislature size, off-cycle elections) impact vote choice and minority voter turnout? When and where do they facilitate or hinder cross-over voting? At the same time, new questions are becoming increasingly salient: Under what circumstances do minority candidates emerge? How is this impacted by the use of primary or run-off elections or the presence of multiple racial/ethnic candidates on the same ballot? What role do community organizations, interest groups, and leaders play in urban elections and campaigns? How do campaign finance, and the content, tone and consequences of media coverage impact local elections?<br/><br/>Given the large number of cases and considerable institutional and contextual variation across local governments, one might assume that the study of local elections is an area already well harvested by participation scholars. The truth, however, is that this is a rather unexplored area of inquiry. On the one hand are studies that focus primarily on candidate- and campaign-specific explanations of turnout and vote choices and typically rely on single city or small-N analyses (e.g., Liu & Vanderleeuw 2007; Barreto, Villarreal & Woods 2005; Bullock 1984). While this body of work offers considerable insight about specific electoral contests and proves indispensable with regard to theory and hypothesis building, it is relatively limited when it comes to empirical description and causal inference. A second area of inquiry employs macro-level models and aggregate level data to explore how local context, electoral and other governing arrangements influence two principal phenomena: voter turnout and minority representation in local legislatures. Although these studies typically rely on relatively large samples (e.g., Engstrom & McDonald 1981; Meier et al. 2005; Kelleher & Lowery 2004) only a handful include longitudinal designs (Marschall, Shah & Ruhil 2008; Trounstine & Valdini 2008; Caren 2007; Sass & Pittman 2000; Karnig & Walter 1983) and almost none includes candidate- or campaign-specific covariates (but see Lublin & Tate 1995). Consequently, while these studies are stronger on empirical description and inference, they provide little purchase when it comes to understanding how local electoral dynamics actually shape electoral outcomes.<br/><br/>The first objective of LEAP is to compile the most comprehensive, public-use, database on local governments and elections in America. In addition to aggregate-level turnout and vote choice data across multiple election cycles (primary, run-off and general elections) for a large, representative sample of U.S. jurisdictions, LEAP will also collect election-specific covariates (candidate race/ethnicity and experience, campaign expenditures, issues, and media coverage) for a subset of jurisdictions with populations that are either multi-racial/ethnic or predominately of one minority group. Finally, by also compiling precinct-level data for this subsample of places, the racial and ethnic dimensions of local elections can be appropriately analyzed. With data on multiple offices and elections at two levels of analysis, LEAP will allow for aggregate, hierarchical and ecological analyses of a broad range of questions on political behavior, minority incorporation and urban politics. Thus a second objective of our project is to lay the institutional foundation for making these data as accessible as possible, while at the same time developing a framework for expanding and maintaining these public-use data over time.<br/><br/>This workshop will bring together a wide range of scholars to provide input into what sort of data should be collected and how to proceed with this data collection."

The dataset will consist of over 40,000 fossil animal bones that date to >70,000 (Blombos), and >181,000 (PP 13B). Thompson's study will determine what proportions of the collections represent the food remains from human inhabitants rather than residue from other bone accumulators such as carnivores, rodents, and raptors. Once this is determined, the hunting and butchering strategies of these people can be inferred from marks left on the bones: cut marks from removing meat and percussion marks from extracting marrow. <br/><br/>Both sites date to a time known as the Middle Stone Age (MSA), from ca. 250 to ca. 30 thousand years ago (ka). This is a critical period in human evolution because, although the skeletal remains dating to this time are physically modern, it is not clear if these humans behaved as modern people do. Recent discoveries of carved pigments and personal ornaments from Blombos have shown that creativity and symbolic behavior was present in our species at least 70,000, but the relationship between these factors and diet remains unknown. Work on this problem has been seriously hindered by a lack of empirical data: in all of Southern Africa only one other collection from this time period has been comprehensively analyzed and published. Thompson's study will create two new datasets that can be directly compared to this one (DK 1), thus effectively tripling the empirical record for faunal collections that are complete and have been fully analyzed. For the first time, behavioral comparisons can be made between sites with abundant evidence for symbolic behavior (Blombos) and with less such evidence (PP 13B and DK 1).<br/><br/>The methodology contains a heavy emphasis on proper curation of the faunal remains, so that future researchers can easily locate and examine any portion of the assemblages, including materials not used in this project (reptiles, birds, fish, etc.). Each specimen identifiable to element will be drawn into a Geographical Information System (GIS) database, creating a permanent digital record that can be shared instantaneously by researchers around the world.<br/><br/>Because of South African heritage laws, the data must be collected in Cape Town. This provides an opportunity for information be provided to the scientific and local communities in the country where the materials were discovered. Archaeological research into human behavior during this critical time period has the potential to identify and illustrate which behavioral aspects all modern humans share. This has particularly significant implications for a newly integrated multiracial and multiethnic country such as South Africa. As the study proceeds, Thompson will present information to middle and high school-aged students by participating in an outreach program organized by a colleague at the South African Museum. The program is designed to inform and excite, as well as to promote archaeological conservation to the future guardians of these irreplaceable resources."

However, in today's multiethnic, multiracial, culturally diverse society, another factor that may influence academic achievement for ethnic minority young people is their perceptions of discrimination in U.S. society. Discrimination likely influences orientation toward school and subsequently academic achievement. This research is grounded in the disciplines of adolescent development and social psychology. Two facets of particular interest in this study include better understanding factors influencing adolescents' perceptions of discrimination and subsequent thinking about how to respond to racial discrimination. <br/><br/>This project has three goals: (1) to develop a clear understanding of how adolescents' understand and think about perceived discrimination that they may likely encounter at school and outside of school using developed quantitative measures and through development of qualitative interviews; (2) to disseminate the results to a national audience through peer-reviewed documents and presentations and including undergraduate and graduate research assistants in national conference participation, presentations, and publications; and (3) to create a viable and sustainable research and mentorship program within the Interdisciplinary Program in Child Development at California State University, Northridge. This program will mentor and train underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in social science research skills and critical thinking through multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to understanding ethnic minority adolescents' development using a multi-tiered approach.

Often, they engage in language stylization practices (Coupland 2001), or the highlighted performance of a linguistic style that diverges from the unmarked style of the speaker or context. For example, a Samoan-American who typically speaks a mainstream variety of American English might employ a mock Chinese accent. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Keith Walters and Ms. Elaine Chun will examine the use of language styles as a means of constructing specifically Asian-American and Pacific Islander American youth identities at a public high school in Texas where these groups make up a sizeable minority of an ethnically diverse student body. Of particular interest is how Asian/Pacific Americans incorporate stylization practices into their varied forms of participation in mainstream activities outside the classroom context. The youths in this study, many of whom come from multiracial and immigrant families, are particularly well-positioned to engage in creative stylization practices by drawing from both in-school and out-of-school linguistic resources. While acknowledging the variability within and across the study's various Asian/Pacific American groups, the investigators are also concerned with how members of these groups come to be constructed and construct themselves as an ethnic minority in the U.S. context. Through ethnographic methods of data collection, including three semesters of full-time, daily participant observation, fieldnotes, interviews, and audio- and video-recordings, this study will illuminate the ways in which micro-level language practices relate to students' identities and their local ideologies about language, social identity, and school participation. A discourse-centered analysis of the recorded and transcribed data will tease apart the complex ideologies of race, ethnicity, nation, gender, sexuality, and class that are linked to students' symbolic practices.<br/><br/>This dissertation project will be significant for research in sociolinguistics and Asian/Pacific American studies. It contributes to linguists' understanding of how and why individual speakers move between various styles, and sometimes symbolically across ethnic boundaries, as well as how adolescents learn language ideologies that link particular styles with particular kinds of people. Asian/Pacific Americans have rarely been the focus of linguistics research. This research project will bring attention to a marginalized and particularly complex Asian/Pacific American community in a Texas military town. The project's broader social impact derives from its challenge to popular discourses in the U.S. that perpetuate stereotypical images of Asians and Pacific Islanders. In addition, the in-depth investigation of students' language practices and beliefs in the context of mainstream school activities will benefit policymakers and educators who seek to understand the various ways in which students in immigrant communities accept, negotiate, and benefit from these activities."

Notably, this program continues to be comprised of roughly 60% under-represented minority group students and about 70% female students; a majority of the REU participants go on to graduate programs.<br/>The intellectual merit of this REU Site is the academic and ethical development of junior social science scholars around a topic of immense importance to the future of the United States. The PIs seek to provide the REU students with (1) exposure, (2) experience, and (3) expertise. Specifically, they want to expose undergraduates to both the technical tools and professional culture of social science, and to do that through the scientific course of inquiry in social demography. The PIs want the REU students to experience the rigorous course of study and intensity of the scientific research process firsthand. Additionally, they want these students to demonstrate their expertise as junior members of the academy. To accomplish these goals, the Pis have developed precise program objectives.<br/>To begin with, they expose the REU students to social demography via formal course work and seminars. An undergraduate sociology course, Analytic Demography, comprises the heart of the first one-half of the summer at our REU site. In addition, they conduct a series of professionalization workshops, or ?proseminars,? which the REU Site Director and Co-Director hold during the summer. In these proseminars, REU students discuss issues ranging from getting into and paying for graduate school to the myriad ethical issues that demographers and other social scientists confront in conducting their work.<br/>Our students will gain concrete experience in three ways. First, the formal course focuses on the methods and materials of demographic research, with an emphasis on the demography of minority groups. Second, the related Stata programming lab provides students with an introduction to statistical analysis and computer literacy to gain competence in the analysis of population-based data sets. Third, the students will experience an intense mentored research relationship with Population Research Center (PRC) graduate students and faculty affiliates. The REU students will be expected to produce, at the end of the summer, a stand-alone ?deliverable? in the form of a scholarly paper, and have much support in doing so.<br/><br/>Finally, the REU students will demonstrate their expertise at the end of this program in two ways. First, the students will present their research work at the end of the summer to a group of PRC faculty affiliates and graduate students. Second, each of our students will be funded to present his or her REU research paper at the annual meeting of the Southern Demographic Association (SDA) in the fall following the close of the summer program. The SDA has dedicated two sessions each year to the REU alumni in the past, has been very welcoming of these students, and will be asked to do so again.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this program is to influence the future of higher education in the social sciences, with special attention to the racial/ethnic and gender diversity of the future academic workforce. This REU site program aims to influence the continued development of both sociology and demography as fields by helping to train the next generation of population scholars in a rigorous, ethical, and multi-racial/ethnic context."

The project will locate nascent CT activities in the existing curriculum, reinforce and develop the overlap between the curricular area and the target CT area, and subsequently reinforce the CT content in a short, reinforcing instructional unit. This planning grant will be used to prepare for the research by creating, piloting, testing and assembling instructional interventions and materials, approaches to learning progressions in CT, management arrangements and practices across and within VT and HCPS, and advisors across the areas that will need development and oversight in full proposal. The overarching research questions for the full proposal are (1) whether the approach of integrating CT is viable across diverse educational environments, teachers and students, (2) whether the approach has significant negative entailments (""show stoppers""), and (3) whether the approach will prove to be scalable across different school systems. <br/><br/>The CS department at VT has a long history of innovative engagement with K-12 as well as university pedagogy in computational thinking, mathematics, and science instruction. HCPS is a mixed SES, multi-racial district of 50,000 students, with a ten-year history of integrating laptop use into instruction in grades 6-12. The HCPS administration has identified CT as a needed area for growth and has the backing of the District School Board. They have a vision of 3-4 CT activities in every class in every grade across core curricular areas. HCPS?s vision plus VT's CT expertise and the PI's prior experience with the development and scaling up of educational research position this project to produce transformative knowledge and practices."

Youth who are exposed to community violence are at risk for a variety of psychological and behavioral difficulties, including poor academic performance, anxiety, depression, post traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse. Yet, very little research examines why the impact of community violence exposure varies among children. The goal of this research is to identify the characteristics of after-school activities, within schools, homes, and neighborhoods, that protect adolescents from the adverse effects of community violence. By identifying factors that reduce adolescents' risk for violence exposure, this research can have a broad impact, informing after-school programming for poor, urban youth.<br/><br/>First, Dr. Ceballo will utilize longitudinal data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). The PHDCN data was drawn from a random, multiracial sample of 6,228 children and mothers residing in Chicago. PHDCN data will allow Dr. Ceballo to examine the impact of mothers' exposure to community violence on maternal mental health and parenting approaches that can impact children's risk. Second, new survey data will be collected with 500 Latino adolescents. This survey will examine the relations among after-school activity participation, culturally-specific values like familismo (e.g., prioritizing family unity) and parenting approaches on Latino adolescents' violence exposure and psychological well-being. Finally, the third study will recruit a subsample of 100 adolescents to participate in a daily diary study of experiences with community violence. This study addresses one of the greatest limitations in the literature: a reliance on children's retrospective recall of violent events. This study will avoid the biases inherent in participants' recall of traumatic events and will investigate youths' experiences with violence as it occurs, providing unique data about the effects of violence exposure on youth."

There has been much discussion, in both academic disciplines and public forums, about the impact of mixed-race population growth on peoples' stereotypes and prejudices about racial groups, and particularly how biracially-identified individuals may challenge underlying beliefs about racial categories themselves. <br/><br/>This project will examine the impact of exposure to biracial identified, racially ambiguous individuals on White perceivers' beliefs about social categories. Using a naturalistic longitudinal study of recent arrivals to Hawaii (a largely multiracial context) and a series of laboratory experiments in the U.S. mainland, this project tests whether Whites' exposure to biracially identified individuals causes Whites to believe that society is moving away from biological, discrete views of racial categories and to subsequently decrease their personal endorsement of essentialism. Moreover, this proposal tests two seemingly contradictory consequences of essentialist belief change. On the one hand, essentialism reduction should lead to more favorable attitudes towards racial minorities and less use of social categories in judgment. On the other hand, recognizing that society has become less essentialist may increase perceptions of racial equity and racial progress and lower support for diversity policies (e.g., affirmative action). <br/><br/>By identifying the positive and negative consequences of reduced essentialism and the conditions under which reductions occur, this project will aid in identifying potential intergroup interventions that involve naturally occurring challenges to essentialism (e.g., biracial exposure) and help us understand how they operate (e.g., through changing beliefs about societal norms and expanding individuals' cognitive flexibility)."

Data from over 40,000 U.S. employees of a single organization allows examination of demographic combinations of staff across units, including large numbers of Whites, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Americans. This research offers a unique opportunity to examine each of these groups in workplaces where they numerically dominate and are in the minority. Dr. Offermann will compare the effects of different supervisor/subordinate racial, ethnic, or gender combinations on individual and organizational outcomes using attitude data, retention and turnover data, organizational performance, and management evaluations. The key hypothesis is that identification with a superordinate social category (the organization) can reduce the effects of demographic differences. Two of the primary methods will be to measure and compare diversity within and across organizational units, and to conduct qualitative examinations of more and less successful diverse workplaces. These methods are aimed at understanding the factors involved in creating successfully inclusive workplaces. Using multiple years of data, longitudinal analyses will help to determine whether increasing staff diversification over time or prolonged exposure to working in diverse units affects responses. <br/><br/>The results of this research will contribute significantly to knowledge of intergroup relations, and advance knowledge of the effects of diversity in multiracial, multiethnic work settings.

The Department of Psychology and the Graduate Diversity Program (GDP) have successfully hosted the earlier version of the summer research program for underrepresented students for 23 years with the goal of preparing students with advanced research skills in order to pursue a doctoral degree. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This REU's goals are to provide students with (1) direct lab and research experience, (2) critical preparation for graduate study, and (3) greater expertise in Social Cultural Processes in Development and Mental Health. Specifically, the REU program exposes undergraduates to both the technical tools and professional culture of psychological science in this area while simultaneously generating increased rigor in all aspects of their summer endeavors. The relationship between the SROP REU students and their faculty and graduate student co-mentors are a key component of Berkeley's program. To accomplish these goals, clearly defined program objectives have been developed. This REU site creates an advanced research experience by placing students with faculty mentors who have volunteered their time and are committed to serving as dedicated mentors while providing opportunities for the students to engage in research projects closely aligned with their scholarly interests. Each student enters into a focused research apprenticeship where they are expected to produce at the end of their program a significant accomplishment resulting in a scholarly paper. Next, students gain critical preparation for graduate study by participating in a parallel program of weekly workshops focusing on advancing skills pertinent to obtaining a Ph.D. degree. Students are exposed to topics such as writing an effective research statement, obtaining graduate school funding, using scholarly resources, making effective oral and written research presentations, enhancing test performance, and more. Finally, this REU program seeks to increase the expertise of its students by exposing them to current issues in the area of Social Cultural Processes in Development and Mental Health via the research, a journal club, as well as seminars conducted by faculty and graduate students in the department. The REU students demonstrate their knowledge at the end of the summer to their faculty mentor and affiliates, lab co-workers, graduate students and university deans, department heads, students, and personnel by presenting their research results in a seminar.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Past interactions with students through various academically focused endeavors indicate that large numbers of underrepresented students seek to pursue advanced degrees in psychology. These students often express a desired goal of focusing on issues pertinent to race and gender as they interact with developmental, socio-cultural, and mental health variables. Conversely, entry into advanced degree programs in psychology both at Berkeley and other similarly ranked programs is extremely competitive, prohibiting eventual degree attainment, impacting national need. Providing trained scholars for the workforce will better address the important and difficult issue of diversifying mental health support systems as well as the professoriate, where research on race, cultural practices, social justice, bias, and coping mechanisms, are increasingly needed in a multi-racial society. With these factors in mind, this REU Site provides opportunities for the undergraduate students to be trained in these critical areas and have a significant impact on the future scientific workforce of the country."

Because ninth grade achievement is often critical in predicting whether youth stay in or drop out of high school, the overarching goal of the project is to capture students' experiences at this significant juncture. The large sample (n = 1900) is comprised of Latino, African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, White, and multi-racial youth who will transition to high school in Fall of 2012. These high schools are expected to range in racial/ethnic diversity, allowing for tests of the social and academic benefits and challenges of racial/ethnic diversity during the high school transition. Data will be gathered on three achievement-related processes. The first process is academic course-taking patterns in ninth grade, including grades and credits earned. Because high school math largely functions as the gateway to high school completion and college readiness, there will be a particular focus on math course-taking in 9th grade (e.g., whether students are enrolled in Algebra I, and thus ""on time"" for college and whether they pass that course in 9th grade). The second process is the degree to which academic experiences become racialized, particularly the ways in which course-taking might segregate students along racial/ethnic lines. New measures have been developed that allow precise estimates of the degree to which individual students are teamed or clustered with the same peers for academic instruction and the degree to which their academic courses are representative of the racial/ethnic diversity of the high school. The third process is the social capital provided by exposure to cross-race/ethnic peers. It is hypothesized that African American and Latino students may fare better in diverse high schools because they gain access to important knowledge about academic opportunities (e.g., what courses to take, SAT preparation) through their cross-race ties. Thus cross-race ties can function as peer social capital, facilitating the flow of important educational information across racial/ethnic boundaries. By studying these three achievement-related processes (course-taking patterns, whether course-taking segregates students along racial/ethnic lines, and peers as social capital) the research can provide new insights into the challenges that adolescents of color face as they negotiate the high school transition as well as conditions under which greater school ethnic diversity can buffer some of those challenges. <br/><br/>The project addresses NSF criteria for broader impact in three ways. First, the research seeks to understand the ways in which large, urban multi-ethnic public high schools are organized to increase or hinder the opportunities of racial and ethnic minority adolescents to acquire competence and develop interest in STEM-related subject matter. If students do not have adequate preparation and confidence during high school, their likelihood of pursuing STEM fields in college is greatly compromised. Second, the project will have a particular focus on resilient youth and the precursors of successful pathways to high school completion even among those at high risk of dropping out. Such results can have useful implications for developing practices that promote academic engagement and college readiness for all students. Third, the research can offer transformative ways to think about the meaning and measurement of racial/ethnic diversity and opportunities to interact with peers of different racial/ethnic backgrounds even in diverse settings. This perspective can be useful for research in other social settings where the implications of increasing ethnic diversity are a primary concern and for new thinking about a science of diversity."

A major reason for the absence of data is the difficulty in systematically surveying a small, bicoastally-distributed, and ethnically and linguistically diverse population. However, the regionally-concentrated and highly metropolitan residential pattern of the population also permits opportunity to selectively sample Asian Americans from localities where they are most likely to congregate. Telephone households in the top metropolitan areas of Asian populations in the United States will be sampled using a multi-frame approach consisting of unrestricted random-digit dialing Asian exchange density, random-digit dialing at targeted Asian exchange density, and listed-surname frames. A total of 1,000 adult Asians belonging to the six largest Asian ethnic groups and residing in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Honolulu, and Chicago will be interviewed by phone, with 200 completed interviews from each of the five locations. <br/><br/>An initiative to gather primary data on the political attitudes and behavior of Asian Americans is direly needed to bridge the research and data gaps in the studying of American political behavior and the state of the U.S. democracy as a multicultural society. Although large-scale, nationally representative public opinion data have been collected specifically from the African and Hispanic American population, no such data exist for the studying of the political opinion of the nation's third largest and fastest growing minority population. Without such data, it is difficult to gauge the shape of the Asian American political community at the national level. Neither is it possible to advance our understanding of the sources of uneven incorporation of this minority population into the U.S. economic and political systems. Information gathered from this initiative would represent a significant expansion in hypothesis testing concerning race and political behavior as well as of research coverage to geographic locations and American ethnic groups neglected in the extant literature. <br/><br/>This research is an integral part of the investigator's career plans and goals to advance the scholarship, visibility, and influence of Asian Americans--particularly Asian immigrant women--in Political Science and Ethnic Studies. Data and experience gained from this pilot study will be evaluated and used to secure research partnership and major foundation support for the conducting of a larger and more comprehensive multiracial survey to address the nation's issues of inequality in social and political participation and incorporation. This ultimately will contribute to the larger goal of promoting equal opportunities in social and political participation regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and nativity through rigorous social science research and cross-disciplinary intellectual exchange. In these ways, an award from POWRE is critical not only to the advancement of the investigator's career at this juncture, but to the expansion of knowledge and understanding about Asian Americans as a political community and about America as a multicultural democracy."

Phase 1 consists of a 3-year longitudinal and experience-sampling study of women and men in 3 theoretically informative college contexts: (a) a large, public university (University of Illinois, Chicago), (b) a women?s college (Mills College), and (c) a polytechnic university (California State Polytechnic University). With the public university serving as an ecologically-valid comparison group, the researchers will investigate several situational cues (e.g., numerical representation, gender of professors, explicit institutional values of women and/or STEM, etc.) to identify the ones that most impact women's STEM outcomes. This work assesses critical time periods in students' college careers (years 1-3) when they appraise the cues in their new environments, decide upon a major, take major-related courses, and select career options. The data are analyzed using HLM techniques.<br/><br/>Phase 2 consists of six experimental laboratory studies that investigate the causal mechanisms by which cues affect women's STEM outcomes. In particular, they test whether the orientations that academic institutions adopt towards STEM abilities and learning moderate the extent to which situational cues affect women's STEM outcomes. Two sets of institutional orientations, drawn from the literature, are investigated: (a) fixed v. malleable lay-theories of STEM ability, and (b) competitive v. cooperative orientations. Because STEM settings are complex and likely to contain more than one situational cue, the experiments will investigate these orientations within the context of other cues known to negatively affect women in STEM (e.g., numerical under-representation, gender-segregation, and the congruence between an individual's and an institution's orientation). It is hypothesized that institutional orientations that facilitate effort and persistence while guarding against performance concerns--namely malleable (v. fixed) theories of STEM abilities and a cooperative (v. competitive) environment--will ameliorate the negative effects of under-representation and gender segregation on women's STEM outcomes. Data are analyzed using ANOVA and linear regression techniques that allow for tests of causal mechanisms. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The project offers direct examinations of how situational cues influence women's interests, aspirations, persistence, and performance in STEM. This work has potential to illuminate aspects of STEM settings that negatively influence women's STEM outcomes and provide specific, concrete, and easily adaptable strategies that can be used in STEM classrooms and to train STEM faculty and students. By providing strategies for both institutions and individuals, this work is poised to provide insight into how equitable and inviting STEM environments can be created. The findings will be actively disseminated in psychology and education journals and at national conferences. A website will also be developed to enable broader dissemination. In addition, the findings will be actively shared with STEM educators at both the high school and university levels. The project fosters the integration of research and education as undergraduate and graduate research assistants are involved at every stage. Women and members of underrepresented groups will be recruited as undergraduate and graduate research assistants."

It contains a program of research and training for conducting quantitative education policy and practice-related research using large-scale national and international data sets. It would support a fellows program to federal agencies, doctoral fellows, a small grants competition, training in statistical data base analysis, and a series of special targeted meetings ""think tanks"" for special focused issues not addressed otherwise. Researchers, mostly at beginning levels, would compete for these programs from fields of mathematics, sciences, education, sociology, economics, and psychology and often work across disciplines. The Grants Board would meet 3 times a year to recommend grant awards and to monitor the grant activities. The grant is managed by an office at University of California, Santa Barbara."

Despite the rapid growth of biracial people, very little is known about how biracial people are perceived and placed into social or racial groups by others. The goal of this research is to test a racial categorization model that addresses the complexities inherent in classifying racially ambiguous targets -- such as those who are biracial and bicultural. This project will identify the central attributes that guide racial categorization by identifying the social psychological processes that influence how racially ambiguous people are categorized. Across several experiments, the proposed research will (1) identify which attributes, singly or together, guide racial categorization (e.g., physical appearance, cultural practice, racial ancestry), (2) clarify the inferences drawn from such attributes (e.g., inferences of disadvantage and perceived self-identification of targets), (3) establish the unique consequences of minority categorization for diversity-related entitlements (e.g., whether people believe a biracial target should benefit from an affirmative action policies) and expectations (e.g., whether people believe a biracial target will contribute to the diversity of opinion that would enhance group performance), and (4) assess the characteristics of perceivers that moderate responses to attributes (e.g., belief in biological essentialism, perceiver gender, perceiver race). <br/><br/>This research will reveal how, why, and when racially ambiguous individuals are categorized as ethnic minorities. Moreover, the research will examine the important but often ignored outcomes of minority categorization. Such outcomes include not only drawbacks (such as being stereotyped) but also benefits (e.g., entitlements to resources via affirmative action policies) or perceptions that individuals are valuable to groups (i.e., diversity contributions). In doing so, this project will inform public policies such as institutional commitments to diversity and affirmative action regarding how best to structure those policies to address a broad array of ethnic minorities of diverse, often mixed, backgrounds."

Some argue that residential segregation and the geographical isolation of blacks from whites in large metropolises has contributed to the emergence of an underclass, and to racial differences in earnings, schooling, and single parenting. Using the decennial censuses, the only source of information about residential segregation, researchers have done much to understand the causes and consequences of this form of racial and ethnic inequality. This project extends such research using data on the distribution of racial and ethnic groups down to the city block from the 2000 Census. It produces three papers based on computing multiple indices of residential segregation for American cities. One describes segregation levels in 2000 and their correlates. Another explores and measures the implications of the new race categories for the analysis of segregation, and a third tests hypotheses about changes in segregation since 1980.<br/><br/>The findings from this project describe baseline information about the levels of racial residential segregation in American metropolises in 2000, how the new multi-race census question confounds the measurement of segregation, and how residential segregation has changed in the recent past. Moreover, the analysis tests several hypotheses in the literature by examining how levels and changes in city size, housing stock, size of minority populations, economic status of minority groups, and industry employment affect segregation. The results have important implications for housing and discrimination policies, and for theories of racial inequality and urban change."
