Biodiversity and ecosystem conservation hinge on our ability to integrate the goals of production and preservation. Although protected areas play a critical role in conservation, because of their limited geographical scope, alone they cannot meet conservation goals. Instead, conservation depends in large part on the anthropogenic landscapes in which protected areas are embedded - the matrix habitat. Intensity of human management of these zones affects the quality of the matrix which separates fragmented habitat, and the ability of wildlife to survive in matrix habitats. Due to their diversity and ecological importance, Neotropical bats are of high conservation concern; however, little information exists on their assemblage structure and ecology outside of continuous or fragmented forests. As insectivores, bats presumably bats have important ecological functions via predation on arthropods and top-down control of herbivore damage. Although it is therefore thought that bats could have a positive effect on agricultural production, little quantitative data exist from tropical ecosystems to support this assumption. This research will therefore address two main questions: (1) What is the conservation potential of differing matrix habitats for bats? and (2) What is the impact of bat populations in agroecosystems on arthropod populations and crop productivity? Research will take place in coffee plantations in Chiapas, Mexico, along a gradient of decreasing matrix quality (from traditional polycultural shade-grown coffee to monocultural low-shade systems). Mist nets, harp traps, and acoustic monitoring will be used to characterize the bat assemblage and habitat use; particular effort will be made to describe the insectivorous bat ensemble. Exclosure experiments will be used to evaluate the effects of bat predation on arthropod populations and plant productivity. This project will result in: an improved understanding of the ability of the agroecological matrix to support bat populations; characterization of under-sampled bat species in matrix habitat; and a quantitative characterization of arthropod regulation by bats in a tropical agroecosystem.<br/>The ultimate goal of this research project is to produce information that will be applied to conservation problems in the tropics, for example via improved landscape-level conservation schemes for Neotropical bats and incorporation of biodiversity conservation in agricultural planning. This research builds upon my dissertation work on the ecology of primates living in shade coffee; at the same time, it will result in a reorientation of my research program towards community ecology and applied ecological studies. Working with Sponsoring Scientist Ivette Perfecto at the University of Michigan will provide a strong foundation in agroecology and community-level studies, preparing me for future research in conservation biology. I plan to continue researching conservation issues in multiple-use landscapes. Ultimately I hope to collaborate closely with social scientists, governments, and local stakeholders to promote improved sustainability in the anthropogenic landscapes which complement the critical role of protected areas in biodiversity conservation."

Scientists agree that what they call Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), is caused by a complex combination of factors, including pesticides, pathogens, parasites and/or poor nutrition yet field research is currently dominated by toxicological practices which emphasize the isolation of individual causal factors and experimental control. Analysis of cumulative and interactive effects of pesticides and other ambient environmental factors?an approach that beekeepers tend to embrace--has been precluded. This 2-year project aims to innovate experimental field research methods so as to better incorporate socio-ecological complexity. They propose to experiment with deliberative strategies for enhancing the influence of non-scientists (beekeepers, farmers, ecologists) on research aimed at understanding CCD. They will facilitate face-to-face deliberations using diverse methodological and conceptual tools for place-based analyses, in conjunction with four pilot field studies of mono-cultural crops and poly-cultural crops, managed with or without ?reduced risk? insecticides. <br/><br/>The environmental and agricultural sustainability of the United States is threatened by steep declines in insect pollinators. The proposed activity seeks to make important contributions to environmental problem solving. It also aims to broaden the participation of primarily affected and often-excluded, non-scientific (non-certified) citizens and to include their varieties of expertise in the production of scientific knowledge and policy. It stands to show that a fairer process, wherein a broader array of stakeholders shapes the research that affects their lives, can lead to better science and policy."

Approaches to intensification of algal biofuel production typically focus on identifying and growing monocultures of microalgal species shown to produce high amounts of lipids. However, these monocultures, because of inherent physiological trade-offs, may not utilize nutrients and light for maximum efficiency, are susceptible to invasions by other species, and can exhibit fluctuations in biomass and lipid productivity. In contrast, microalgal polycultures can potentially circumvent these eco-physiological tradeoffs and provide a more robust platform for algal biofuels production, particularly in scalable open cultivation systems. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the proposed research is to design multispecies microalgal communities that optimize resource utilization, biomass production, and lipid accumulation under changing environmental conditions while providing increased resistance to pathogens and invasions by nuisance species. Towards this end, the diverse eco-physiological traits of many algal species will be analyzed to deduce the trade-offs among these traits, and from this analysis, the appropriate species for microalgal consortia will be identified that maximize multiple goal functions under process constraints. Mathematical models, combined with laboratory experiments for parameter estimation and model validation, will be used to assess the dynamic behavior of the designed polyculture communities, and identify those with best performance characteristics relative to their respective monocultures. The most promising microalgal communities will be further investigated for scalability using enclosed photobioreactors and open pond cultivation systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The proposed education and outreach activities will offer K-12 student and teacher experiences in bioenergy topics through the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) GK-12 Bioenergy Sustainability Project, which engages local rural schools in ecological and sustainability research. The PI will host a high school teacher during the summer to develop age-appropriate, hands-on educational modules on bionergy, sustainability, and aquatic ecology. A postdoctoral associate will be trained in interdisciplinary research combining mathematical modeling, ecological principles, and bioenergy applications, and will interact with the researchers from the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC) to exchange ideas on the use of polycultures for biofuel production."

The PIs propose to combine cyber-human systems and crowdsourcing research with the science of agroecology with two main research goals: 1) to develop an understanding of how online design tools may contribute to sustainability through enhanced local food production, and 2) to utilize the population of a plant species database as an instance of a class of problems amenable to intelligent crowdsourcing, and pioneer new knowledge in crowdsourcing optimization. As part of this project, the research team will design, build, deploy, and evaluate the Sustainable Polyculture Composer, an online software tool to aid in the design of small-scale plant-based agricultural ecosystems (e.g., back yard food forests). <br/><br/>Long-term food security is central to sustainability. US food supply chains contribute to global change and are vulnerable to its impacts. Large numbers of small-scale, sustainable, local food production systems could help ensure food security in the face of global change, and could help reduce the environmental impacts of the US food supply. Unfortunately, many efforts at local food production (e.g., back yard gardens) require significant inputs such as water and fertilizer. Effective tools and techniques to encourage novices to begin growing their own food in sustainable ways are lacking. The work will contribute to long-term food security and offer lessons, concepts, methods, and software tools that may be transferable to other sustainability challenges. In addition, the computing research will provide an example that can be generalized to other efforts to more effectively integrate knowledge that is distributed across many people."

This is due primarily to over-fishing of wild abalone. Farm reared abalone have not yet been produced in sufficient quantity to fill this void in the world market. Significant effort is being devoted to the development of cost-effective abalone cultivation systems. The limited availability of suitable seaweed as abalone food has been identified as one of the main impediments to farming of abalone. It is the problem of food availability that Big Island Abalone Corporation proposes to address in this feasibility test of it's proprietary design for a low maintenance, land-based, modular abalone and macro-algae polyculture grow-out system. The primary focus of the proposed research will be to determine the maximum sustainable production of a macro alga, Palmaria mollis, to be used as abalone food, under the unique parameters that comprise the aquaculture environment at the Natural Energy Laboratory Hawaii Authority at Keahole Point, Hi. The ability to grow dulse in sufficient quantity to sustain commercial production of abalone is pivotal for the success of BIAC's efforts at commercial abalone farming. The demand for abalone, as a result of the precipitous declines in world-wide Catch, is at an all time high. The FAO has estimated the world catch of abalone in 1968 at 28,000 metric tons, and only 13,000 metric tons in 1995. With this plunge in wild catch of abalone has come significant increases in price at all market levels. Again in 1968, abalone landed in California sold for about $95.00 a dozen. While today wild caught abalone in California are selling for about $600.00 a dozen. The market for abalone, while world-wide in scope, is not one market but actually two. The largest segment and somewhat independent from the smaller, is in Asia (Japan, China, Hong Kong, Korea & Taiwan). The smaller market segment includes the United States, Canada, Mexico, En gland, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, France, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, with emerging interest in Chile. From it's mid-Pacific base Big Island Abalone is strategically placed to sell abalone in all Pacific Rim markets. ***"

The efficiency with which plants use nutrients is a theme that unites physiological processes at many scales - from leaves, to plants, to whole ecosystems. Can differences in nutrient use efficiency at the leaf and plant level be scaled up to predict nutrient use efficiency at the ecosystem level? Nutrient use efficiency will be ilvestigated at different scales in a series of simplified tropical ecosystems: tree monocultures, and polycultures of trees and a very different life form - large, perennial monocots. Nutrient use efficiency will be calculated at the leaf level, as the maximum potential photosynthetic rate per unit nutrient content; at the plant level, as total biomass produced relative to nutrient uptake; and at the ecosystem level, as biomass production relative to nutrient supply. The study will provide an opportunity to compare nutrient use efficiency across scales, and across life forms. Understanding feedbacks between nutrient use efficiency at the leaf and plant level, and ecosystem nutrient use, will provide insight into the functional role of biodiversity. It will also provide a powerful tool in enabling restoration of degraded lands, and design of land use systems that are effective at nutrient conservation."

This research has resulted in major advances and has shown that diversity can affect ecosystem processes. However, we are currently limited in our ability to draw generalities regarding these effects that transcend ecosystems and to apply this knowledge to conservation and management efforts because: (1) most experiments are of short duration and relatively few are conducted under field conditions on natural substratum; and (2) most experiments manipulate only diversity and so cannot assess the strength of diversity relative to other known drivers of ecosystem functioning. Previous NSF-funded work found that species diversity of seaweeds does increase the accumulation of producer biomass and the diversity and richness of mobile invertebrates associated with those seaweeds. In this project, the investigator will examine the interactive effects of plant and grazer richness on seaweed productivity and assemblage recovery from disturbance by (a) continuing our ongoing diversity manipulations (b) nesting additional experiments manipulating grazers within these plots, and (c) performing new experiments to examine effects of grazer richness on algal assemblages. The main experiment consists of 72 1.5 m diameter plots in the rocky intertidal at Bodega Bay, California, split into 6 different treatments: a monoculture of each of the 4 algal species that comprise >85% of the algal cover in our system; a 4-species polyculture, and an unmanipulated control plot. The PI created these ""diversity"" plots by weeding under the auspices of a previous NSF grant. Objectives of this project are: (1) To nest within the diversity plots smaller cleared areas that either allow or prohibit access by grazers in order to test the interactive effects of algal diversity and herbivory on recovery of the algal assemblage from disturbance (or resilience). (2) To conduct a separate combined additive and replacement series experiment to examine the effects of herbivore identity and richness on algal recruitment and succession. (3) While the nested grazer-exclusion experiment is in progress, to continue weeding and collecting data in the uncleared portion of these plots as a continued test of the univariate effect of algal richness on the cover of algae and sessile invertebrates, and on mobile invertebrate abundance, richness, and diversity. Together with previous results, this will produce a 7 year record of the effects of seaweed richness on rocky intertidal communities, which will then be correlated with archived environmental data. (4) After the nested grazer exclusion experiment is complete, to cease weeding plots and track their reinvasion by weeded species in order to evaluate the mechanisms maintaining diversity of perennial algae.<br/><br/>Understanding the consequences of simultaneous changes in grazer abundance or diversity and algal diversity as well as the long-term effects of both on the resilience of algal communities in the face of disturbance will provide a better understanding of both the consequences of human encroachment into these habitats and the appropriate management efforts needed to minimize impacts and maintain ecosystem functioning. This is especially critical given that harvesting and trampling by humans are altering the diversity and composition of herbivores and algae in the California rocky intertidal zone. The PI recently briefed legislative and agency staff in California on the results of previous NSF work on the consequences of marine biodiversity, so there is interest from policymakers. The PI will continue to work with outreach groups like COMPASS and the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program to help disseminate the findings of this research as broadly as possible to the general public and decision-makers. In addition, through outreach efforts such as the Bodega Marine Lab Open House and visits to local schools the investigator will continue to foster public understanding of the importance of maintaining biodiversity and more generally of how science works. Finally, this project will develop future scientists including a technician, graduate and undergraduate researchers including those from underrepresented groups."
