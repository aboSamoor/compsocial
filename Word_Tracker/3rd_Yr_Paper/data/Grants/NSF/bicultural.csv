Psychological and linguistic research suggests that the language of administration may influence responses through its impact on various cognitive processes and through the cultural frame that a language brings to the conversational context. However, the extent to which the language of survey administration affects survey responding is currently unknown. The objectives of this project are to examine the extent to which language of administration influences bilingual bicultural respondents' answers to survey questions and to investigate which types of questions are most susceptible to language effects. These objectives will be addressed through secondary analyses of observational data and an experiment. Secondary analyses of the New Immigrant Survey will compare differences in responses among those interviewed in English and those interviewed in Spanish and identify the types of questions for which these differences are particularly pronounced. The lack of random assignment to a language will be overcome by using propensity score methods. In addition, an experimental web survey of about 300 adult Arab-American immigrants from the Detroit area, randomly assigned to an English or Arabic version of the questionnaire, will be launched. The experiment will include questions with varying degrees of sensitivity and social desirability across the American and Arab cultures to assess if the language of administration affects conformity with cultural norms. It also will include autobiographical questions to assess differences in recall as a function of the match between the language spoken at the time of the initial encoding and the language at the time of recall. <br/><br/>This project brings basic psychological and linguistic research to bear on surveys of bilingual bicultural respondents, for whom the language of survey administration may evoke different cultural frames. It will illuminate how the language of survey administration affects respondents' answers and will highlight the methodological implications for surveys of immigrant populations. The broader societal impact of this work derives from the relevance of collecting accurate data from immigrants. If language affects socially desirable responding and the accuracy of autobiographical recall, the choice of language may be an important factor in collecting accurate data for policy decisions. At present, little is known about these possibilities, despite the considerable resources invested in surveys of immigrant populations. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

For example, the Chinese word closest to the English word ""sofa"" includes padded, upholstered seats for one person, while the Chinese word closest to the English word ""chair"" is limited to unpadded seating made of hard materials, such as wood. How do people learning two languages handle such differences? Do they develop separate ways of connecting words to the world in each language or do they learn a single and unique way that does not fully match monolinguals in either language? In this project, the investigators attempt to understand, within the broader context of language interaction in the bilingual mind, how the pattern of word use in one's first language (L1) can influence that in the second language (L2), how L1 knowledge itself can change as L2 knowledge increases, and how the fluctuating experience and knowledge of one language can create the conditions for language interactions to occur. The project will use both behavioral studies and computational modeling to explore the unique and joint contributions of a set of cognitive variables (age of exposure to each language, proficiency in each, and the type of exposure to each) to bilingual lexical knowledge.<br/><br/>As globalization advances, more people are becoming bilingual or multilingual. The study of language interaction in individuals has implications for understanding the bilingual person's verbal communication, social integration, and consequent career opportunities and may yield information useful for designing learning interventions to improve language proficiency. The proposed work will integrate research and education across the two collaborative sites (Pennsylvania State University and Lehigh University). The research also involves international collaborations between scientists in the US, Europe, and China. The cross-disciplinary nature of the project should attract students from psychology, linguistics, and cognitive and computational sciences, providing opportunities particularly to students from bilingual and bicultural backgrounds."

In particular, previous anthropological and cultural psychological research illustrates two main styles of ways of thinking about one's self: independent (i.e., individualism) and interdependent (i.e., collectivism). Individuals from independent cultures, such as America, value their autonomy, uniqueness, freedom and right to self-expression, whereas individuals interdependent cultures, such as Japan, value social harmony, conformity and adherence to group norms. Cultural variation in self-construal style has previously been shown to broadly affect cognitive and emotional processes, especially those related to the self. Despite a large body of behavioral evidence demonstrating cultural influences on the self and a growing body of studies on the neurobiological mechanisms of self-relevant processes, very little is known about how culture affects self processes in the brain. The main objective of the proposed activity is to examine how culture affects mental and neural mechanisms underlying the self and social behavior. Using functional neuroimaging (fMRI) in a cross-cultural (e.g., Caucasian-Americans and native Japanese) and bicultural cohort of second-generation Japanese-American immigrants, the current research aims to characterize how different cultural styles of self construal affect self-relevant processes in the brain, particularly within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). One primary aim of the current research is to investigate how independent and interdependent selves differentially represent and process self-relevant information in the mind and brain. Another aim is to investigate neural mechanisms underlying the ability of multicultural individuals, possessing both independent and interdependent styles of self-construal, to ""switch"" between different self-construal styles depending on their sociocultural context. By incorporating cultural psychological theory into social and cognitive neuroscience research, this research project will lay a critical foundation for future research examining how diverse cultural environments influence the self and social behavior at multiple levels of analysis. At the broadest level, this project will integrate education and research by involving Japanese and American scientists at all levels who will gain training and experience in the development of novel cross-cultural neuroimaging techniques and effective international scientific collaboration. The expected findings may benefit society at large by demonstrating how different cultural styles of self-knowledge can lead to diverse, but effective, avenues to social functioning. This interdisciplinary research may have further implications for understanding the role of cultural factors in vulnerability to and prevalence of social and affective disorders involving the self."

The goal of this UMEB program is to train under-represented minority students in research that integrates these two fields. Many of the biology faculty already incorporate molecular biology techniques in the study of questions in environmental biology. For example, UMEB scholars can use DNA sequencing to answer questions about rotifer systematics and snake venom evolution. They can use DNA fingerprinting techniques, such as AFLP analysis, to assess genetic diversity of rotifers and fish in the Rio Grande.<br/><br/>The program activities for the UMEB Scholars at UTEP explicitly require training in both environmental and molecular biology. UMEB Scholars each have two mentors. One mentor concentrates on training in environmental biology while the other mentor concentrates on training the student to incorporate molecular approaches into their study of environmental biology. We believe that the most successful program for the recruitment and retention of minority students in environmental biology will include training in molecular biology, as skills in these areas are often lacking in classically-trained students, but graduate schools and other employers favor hiring those who can perform newer analyses. All UMEB research projects involve a substantial amount of fieldwork for surveying and studying natural populations, but the students also collect samples of their organisms in order to apply molecular techniques to their own research projects. In addition, students meet regularly for training in experimental design, elementary statistics, mechanics of scientific presentations, preparing for the GRE, identifying appropriate graduate school mentors, contacting potential mentors and applying to graduate school. <br/><br/>Three cohorts of four students entering their sophomore or junior year will participate in the 2-year UMEB Scholars program. Over 4 years, NSF will fund 12 students. During their first year the students spend one semester in each of the two faculty mentors' labs. At the end of the first year, students present their proposed research and preliminary findings at the UTEP Research Expo, an on-campus forum for undergraduate research. During the first summer, the students work on their research full time. The two mentors coordinate with the student the appropriate balance of field and lab work for the particular project being conducted. During the second year, the UMEB Scholars continue working on their research 10-15 hours each week under the joint supervision of their two mentors. During this year, the students participate in their first national or regional scientific meeting and travel to a prospective graduate school of the student's choosing.<br/><br/>UTEP serves El Paso County, a mostly bi-national/bicultural community. The ethnic composition of the University mirrors the community it serves, with Hispanics, mostly Mexican-American, accounting for over 71% of the student body. Additionally, 54.7% of the university population is female. This UMEB program provides appropriate mentoring through the various program activities including hands-on research, field trips, workshops, and travel to scientific meetings and graduate schools. This program is sure to have long-lasting effects on the scientific careers of the UMEB scholars. <br/>. <br/>For more information, contact Dr. Sandra Perez (phone: 915-747-8816; e-mail: sperez@utep.edu) or Dr. William Mackay (phone 915-747-6991; email wmackay@utep.edu)."

Such upward mobility trends are especially likely if an enclave is socioeconomically diverse, which itself often results from successive immigration waves. However, enclaves can also experience internal conflicts and factionalism, which can hinder working-class co-ethnics from effectively mobilizing resources and becoming upwardly mobile. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the Korean enclave in Beijing as a case in point to examine the conditions under which co-ethnic immigrants manage to mobilize resources and pursue upward mobility under adverse conditions, i.e, where the enclave experiences strained solidarity. By strained solidarity, we mean significant levels of distrust manifested at the community level that impair smooth interactions among co-ethnics. The Korean enclave in Beijing is split (both socially and institutionally) between fourth-generation Korean Chinese rural migrants and recent South Korean immigrants. Nonetheless, the enclave has evolved into a flourishing residential and commercial district in which even lower-status Korean Chinese minorities have become increasingly upwardly mobile. The PIs examine the degree to which these mobility trends are related to various forms of cultural capital (linguistic, knowledge-based) and hypothesize that relying on transnational resources plays an important role in this context. Specifically, ties with both the recently arrived South Korean entrepreneurial class and resources available via their country of origin, South Korea. The study employs an original survey, interviews, and ethnographic field work involving Koreans in Beijing to test theoretically grounded hypotheses.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This study helps us understand the changing nature of upward mobility in an increasingly inter-connected world. It may advance our understanding of how historically disadvantaged minority groups can employ bilingual and bicultural abilities and other assets (innovations in communication and travel) to improve their mobility chances in ways that would not have been possible even a few decades ago. Findings from this study may be of interest to urban planners as well as policy makers and economists. In addition, this case study contributes to the sociological literature by examining whether classical notions of group solidarity as a mechanism for upward mobility apply to contemporary transnational enclaves."

As with many other island situations, the arrival of people to New Zealand marked the beginning of dramatic changes to the abundance and distribution of native fauna. One of the best examples of the effects of human colonization is the decline and extinction of the moas in New Zealand. Moas were an order of large wingless birds endemic to New Zealand that became extinct after the arrival of Polynesian colonists between 1000 to 500 years ago. The abundance of moa remains in archaeological sites suggests that moas were an integral part of the diet for the prehistoric human foragers of New Zealand. Dr. Nagaoka's previous research on the South Island of New Zealand has shown that the hunting and gathering economy of the prehistoric inhabitants was dramatically affected by the depletion of moas and other fauna. The diet of the human foragers shifted from mainly seals and moas to a very generalized diet that included up to 70 taxa of fish, birds, and mammals. To harvest this wider range of resources, people also began exploiting areas that were less productive than those previously exploited. <br/><br/>The research funded by this grant continues to examine prehistoric subsistence change resulting from resource depletion, but on the North Island where horticultural crops were an important part of the diet by European contact. Using foraging theory models hypotheses were generated that examine changes in 1) the number and kinds of resources exploited; 2) the number and kinds of habitats utilized; and 3) the pattern of butchery and transport of moa and seal carcasses. To test these expectations, two faunal assemblages from the Northland region of the North Island are analyzed. These assemblages were selected because they are from relatively well-stratified sites with large samples of faunal and artifactual material that date to the period just after Polynesian colonization. In addition, they are from the same region as the well-known and well-studied Houhora (Mt. Camel) site, which will provide an excellent complement and comparison to these assemblages.<br/><br/>In addition to increasing archaeological knowledge of North Island subsistence change, this research is of interest to researchers studying in both prehistoric and modern examples of human-induced environmental change and its consequences for faunal populations and humans. In addition to the intellectual interest, this research will also have broader impacts on two different populations: Maori iwi (native tribes) and students. The results of this analysis will be available to the iwi through the New Zealand institutions that house the collections, and who are committed to bicultural representation in its public displays as well as in research. The results will be further disseminated to the public through the undergraduate courses taught to elementary and middle school children."

For example, the Chinese word closest to the English word ""sofa"" includes padded, upholstered seats for one person, while the Chinese word closest to the English word ""chair"" is limited to unpadded seating made of hard materials, such as wood. How do people learning two languages handle such differences? Do they develop separate ways of connecting words to the world in each language or do they learn a single and unique way that does not fully match monolinguals in either language? In this project, the investigators attempt to understand, within the broader context of language interaction in the bilingual mind, how the pattern of word use in one's first language (L1) can influence that in the second language (L2), how L1 knowledge itself can change as L2 knowledge increases, and how the fluctuating experience and knowledge of one language can create the conditions for language interactions to occur. The project will use both behavioral studies and computational modeling to explore the unique and joint contributions of a set of cognitive variables (age of exposure to each language, proficiency in each, and the type of exposure to each) to bilingual lexical knowledge.<br/><br/>As globalization advances, more peopleare becoming bilingual or multilingual. The study of language interaction in individuals has implications for understanding the bilingual person's verbal communication, social integration, and consequent career opportunities and may yield information useful for designing learning interventions to improve language proficiency. The proposed work will integrate research and education across the two collaborative sites (Pennsylvania State University and Lehigh University). The research also involves international collaborations between scientists in the US, Europe, and China. The cross-disciplinary nature of the project should attract students from psychology, linguistics, and cognitive and computational sciences, providing opportunities particularly to students from bilingual and bi-cultural backgrounds."

Her focus will be a case study of immigrant adaptation and well-being in Costa Rica, where a two-decade wave of Nicaraguan immigration has challenged concepts of national and personal identity among immigrants and the host population. The research will build upon existing scholarship that suggests a strong sense of cultural identity can protect against a variety of stressors faced by immigrants, particularly when it forms part of a bicultural identity that fuses aspects of both home and host cultures. This study also considers how social relations between groups influence identity formation and moderate its protective effects upon well-being. <br/><br/>The researcher will undertake nine months of field research in Costa Rica. The first phase of the the research will involve participant-observation, semi-structured and structured interviews among samples of Nicaraguan immigrants and Costa Rican citizens. Cultural consensus analysis, which measures quantitatively the degree of cultural sharing across informants, will be used to reveal cultural models of identity. In the second phase of the research, a survey will be distributed to a large sample of informants to test the relationship between individuals' cultural consonance or the degree to which they personally approximate the shared models of identity, and a variety of standard measures of psychological well-being. <br/><br/>This research introduces a method for operationalizing the construct of identity and furthers an understanding of how immigrants forge their identities under varying cultural conditions. The research will contribute to refining social science theories about immigrant well-being and social integration. It also will inform policies and programs to foster the successful integration and adaptation of immigrant populations while preserving their well-being and unique cultural heritages."

This project will identify the central attributes that guide racial categorization by identifying the social psychological processes that influence how racially ambiguous people are categorized. Across several experiments, the proposed research will (1) identify which attributes, singly or together, guide racial categorization (e.g., physical appearance, cultural practice, racial ancestry), (2) clarify the inferences drawn from such attributes (e.g., inferences of disadvantage and perceived self-identification of targets), (3) establish the unique consequences of minority categorization for diversity-related entitlements (e.g., whether people believe a biracial target should benefit from an affirmative action policies) and expectations (e.g., whether people believe a biracial target will contribute to the diversity of opinion that would enhance group performance), and (4) assess the characteristics of perceivers that moderate responses to attributes (e.g., belief in biological essentialism, perceiver gender, perceiver race). <br/><br/>This research will reveal how, why, and when racially ambiguous individuals are categorized as ethnic minorities. Moreover, the research will examine the important but often ignored outcomes of minority categorization. Such outcomes include not only drawbacks (such as being stereotyped) but also benefits (e.g., entitlements to resources via affirmative action policies) or perceptions that individuals are valuable to groups (i.e., diversity contributions). In doing so, this project will inform public policies such as institutional commitments to diversity and affirmative action regarding how best to structure those policies to address a broad array of ethnic minorities of diverse, often mixed, backgrounds."

In six experiments that integrate behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) methods, this approach analyzes how the details people remember for visual images differ across cultures. The lens of culture can direct preferred modes of processing and/or attention to particular features of the environment, and this will affect what is remembered. In a comparison of East Asian, Turkish, and Western (i.e., American) cultures, Angela Gutchess of Brandeis University will examine cultural differences in exactly what people remember. Americans are predicted to remember more specific details due to their preferential attention to features. In contrast, the groups will be well-matched on general memory, which is not dependent upon attention to features. Predicted cultural differences in memory should reflect the use of intentional strategies, and directing people's attention to specific, relevant features should reduce cross-cultural differences in memory. Furthermore, aging, which reduces the availability of cognitive capacities to deploy strategies and process details in explicit memory, should reduce cross-cultural differences in memory specificity. In contrast, for implicit memory, cultural differences in memory for specific details will continue to be observed because the development of implicit memories is not thought to depend on cognitive capacity. Functional neuroimaging methods will provide converging evidence for cultural differences in memory specificity, and identifying neural regions will help the PI to distinguish between different theoretical accounts for why people from different cultures remember things differently. <br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the proposal include examining cultural differences across both explicit and implicit memory, which are thought to be separable memory systems. To date, the majority of research findings on memory are based on Western populations, meaning that theories of memory may largely characterize Westerners and may not generalize to other populations. The study of cultural differences will lead to a more inclusive field of psychology, with a better understanding of which memory principles are universals vs. are culture-dependent. The proposed work will make substantial advances in understanding the mechanisms of cross-cultural differences in memory specificity by employing a multimethod approach using sensitive memory measures, including neuroimaging. <br/><br/>By studying memory in a multicultural world, the proposed studies may contribute to better cross-cultural understanding as well as better scientific understanding. Little work has investigated cultures outside of the East/West dichotomy. If the nature of memory formation differs across cultures, this could help people better understand why people from Eastern and Western cultures often view the world differently because what we remember powerfully shapes what we believe. In legal settings, for example, people who remember more details of the situation in which a crime was committed may hold a perpetrator less responsible than people who focus solely on (and disproportionately remember) the perpetrator's actions. Diverse populations will also be included in this research through international collaboration and participation of non-Westerners in the proposed research. This will provide a training ground for young scientists across international sites and heightening their awareness of the impact of culture on psychological processes. Finally, the work will be broadly disseminated through participation in international conferences as well as science outreach programs."

Rather than examining only the auditory and spoken language abilities of deaf and hard-of-hearing children, the workshop's research framework will conceptualize these children as multilingual learners who experience the world both auditorily and visually. The workshop participants will address four key methodological questions: (1) what is the best neuroimaging approach for deaf and hard-of-hearing children, (2) how can we best assess communicative competence in multilingual children, (3) what are the challenges for assessment of the language environment in homes, and (4) how might effective intervention strategies be developed and validated? Swedish partners from the Department of Linguistics at Stockholm University are ideal counterparts in this endeavor because in Sweden's education system, there is extensive experience in bilingual-bicultural education for deaf and hard-of-hearing children and there are relatively high rates of cochlear implantation. Initial success at the workshop should point the way for next steps to explore the complex interplay between cochlear implantation and use of both a visual sign language and an auditory spoken language. <br/><br/>For broader impact, another objective of the workshop in Stockholm is to provide a forum for U.S. doctoral students and early stage researchers to network with Swedish experts and other European academics, exposing them to new perspectives on the development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children. Deaf academics and students will be included in the workshop, alongside representatives of schools and parent groups, to maximize the potential for broad scientific impact. By shifting the framework for discussion and future research planning away from one of deficit to one of diversity, the workshop participants aim to develop innovative research proposals to address the societal problem of how to best educate deaf and hard-of-hearing children."

A main focus of the studies will be to<br/>investigate the sociocognitive processes by which computer simulations<br/>promote complex learning during classroom instruction. The planned studies<br/>include two large classroom experiments that will provide a rich, detailed<br/>picture of how seventh graders' reasoning and knowledge of cells change,<br/>moment to moment, during classroom instruction. The classroom instruction,<br/>using an instructional method called Collaborative Reasoning about<br/>Evidence, will interleave whole-class discussions with small-group work in<br/>which students conduct and discuss simulated experiments. The studies will<br/>aim to provide a fine-grained analysis of how whole-class discussions and<br/>group interactions mediate students' learning. In sum, this program of<br/>research is intended (a) to provide new insights into how to teach students<br/>to reason about epistemologically authentic experimentation and (b) to<br/>produce tested instructional software, materials, and methods that teachers<br/>can readily access and use in their classrooms."
