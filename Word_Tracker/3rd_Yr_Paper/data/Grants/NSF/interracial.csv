Five experimental studies test causal hypotheses about how the diversity of an interaction partner's friendship network and the goals that they adopt signal identity threat or identity safety to their partner. The research examines the mediating mechanisms for how these cues influence affective, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes of both the racial majority and minority individual in the interaction. The research investigates two potential influences on the experiences of social identity threat among whites and ethnic minorities during interracial interaction: 1) the racial diversity (or homogeneity) of an interaction partner's friendships, and 2) the goals (learning or performance) that the partner adopts for the interaction context. The research tests whether this friendship cue and the goals adopted by one's partner influence ethnic minority and white individuals' interaction experiences. In particular, this research measures levels of social identity threat, affect, behavior during the interactions, cognitive depletion, and satisfaction resulting from the interracial interactions. Furthermore, this research tests whether shifts in people's goals within the interaction context can reduce identity threat, opening the door for positive interracial contact in the future-even in the absence of a diverse friendship network. Taking a relational view of interracial interactions, the research examines the processes by which friendships and goals influence experiences of identity threat and its affective, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes from the perspectives of both majority and minority group members.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The research makes novel theoretical contributions to the existing literature on interracial interactions and social identity threat, as well as provides practical guidance about how interracial interactions might be structured to reduce identity threat and facilitate smooth exchange and more enjoyment for both minority and majority group members in the future. This NSF Research Starter Grant allows the PI to continue and extend her postdoctoral work on the effects of situational cues and identity contingencies in the context of interracial interactions. This work contributes to identity threat theory and provides a better understanding of the processes by which cues affect the dynamics of interracial interactions. The PI will serve as a role model and mentor to students interested in examining these important societal issues from a rigorous, scientific perspective. Currently, the PI works with a racially diverse team of graduate and undergraduate students in her lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and this funding aids the PI in obtaining the necessary resources, including graduate student support, to begin an independent research program on this topic."

In some cases, these interactions lead to close interethnic friendships, which have been shown to reduce prejudice, but in other cases, these interactions are stressful for individuals, deterring interethnic friendships from developing. We continue to know very little about the processes that occur during repeated interracial interactions that may lead to or prevent the development of friendships. This is primary because the majority of research on intergroup contact involves brief, single-shot approaches (e.g., contact between out-groups in the laboratory) or uses survey methodology. The first goal of the proposed research is to develop an understanding of the experiences of individuals as they move from initial interracial interactions with acquaintances to having multiple personal contact experiences with the same out-group member, perhaps resulting in interracial friendships. A second goal of the proposed research is to unpack why daily interracial interactions are stressful for individuals, especially for ethnic minorities, preventing interracial friendships from developing. Three studies are proposed that are longitudinal in design, and include repeated samplings over the period of study. This research will provide a rich data set for understanding the dynamic nature of interactions over time and their potential effects on social, academic and health-related outcomes."

Research documents that the anxiety caused by interracial interactions raise many interpersonal concerns that affect people?s experiences with members of other racial groups. However, much less research has explored how the stereotype-confirming behaviors of ingroup members affect such interactions. This project will examine whether minority (Blacks, Latinos) and majority (Whites) group members experience negative mental health outcomes, compensate for ingroup members behavior, or avoid interactions with outgroup members during an interracial interaction after ingroup members have committed stereotype-confirming behaviors. This research will provide novel insights regarding the experiences of people during interracial interactions and highlights how the behavior of racial group members, rather than one?s own behavior, can impact individuals? mental health and behavior in interracial contexts. <br/><br/>The fellow will perform her research at Princeton University, under the sponsorship of Dr. Nicole Shelton in the Psychology Department. Princeton University has a wealth of resources and courses that will assist the fellow in acquiring new methodological and statistical techniques regarding intergroup interactions, mental health, and behavior. Dr. Shelton is one of the premier researchers on intergroup relations in the country. Broadly, her research focuses on 1) the concerns of ethnic minorities and Whites during interracial interactions and 2) the mental health and psychological outcomes of minorities. In her work, she shows that the different interpersonal concerns of ethnic minorities and Whites not only affect the quality of interracial interactions, but the impressions people have about racial outgroup members. Additionally, she examines the psychological adjustment of minority youth and, in another line of work, she investigates how racial bias and mental illness stigma leave people vulnerable to mental health problems. Learning from Dr. Shelton?s expertise in intergroup relations and mental health outcomes, the fellow will be trained to conduct dyadic interaction and mental health research with diverse populations.<br/>To date, there has been a dearth of research on how stereotype-confirming behavior affects people?s mental and behavioral outcomes during interracial interactions. People are aware that the stereotypic behaviors of ingroup members are often generalized to them; thus, they may experience negative mental health outcomes (e.g., shame, anxiety, low state self-esteem) in the face of ingroup members? stereotype-confirming behavior during interracial interactions. Previous research suggests that such mental health outcomes will lead to avoidance behaviors uniformly. However, the current proposal suggests that rather than disengage from interracial interactions when ingroup members behave stereotypically, individuals may exhibit approach behaviors and show improved performance in an attempt to disprove negative group stereotypes. To test these hypotheses, four experimental studies will focus on the mental health and behaviors of racial minorities (Latino/as, Blacks) and Whites after witnessing an ingroup member behave stereotypically during intra- and interracial interactions. To explore the breadth of this phenomenon, all four studies use different racial groups, stereotypes, and situations. This work will provide novel insights into how negative mental health outcomes experienced during interracial interactions after witnessing ingroup members behave stereotypically may be motivating.<br/>The postdoctoral fellowship will allow the fellow to learn new theoretical perspectives on intergroup relations and provide her with methodological and statistical training in this area. With these goals in mind, the fellow has five training objectives while at Princeton: 1) to learn methodology appropriate for studying dyadic interaction; 2) to enhance her statistical knowledge by taking advanced statistics courses; 3) to attend psychology colloquia and seminars by premier researchers in the field; 4) to publish research; and 5) to attend and present her work at national conferences. With the training and resources at Princeton University, the fellow will demonstrate how stereotype-confirming behavior may cause negative mental health outcomes, but also lead to unexpected approach behaviors in interracial interactions. Ultimately, the postdoctoral training will prepare the fellow for a tenure-track position at a research university."

Thus, in interracial interactions, which are already characterized by subtle levels of anxiety, witnessing or interacting with racial group members who behave stereotypically (i.e., commit ""stereotype-confirming"" acts) may exacerbate the strain often experienced in diverse contexts. <br/><br/>Previous research has shown that such experiences may increase people's motivation to behave counterstereotypically to disprove negative group stereotypes, but also may undermine performance and discourage future interracial contact. This previous work, however, leaves us at an impasse: What then contributes to people's ability to thrive in diverse settings following racial group members' stereotype-confirming behavior and how do people cope in such situations? This research sets out to answer these important questions first by investigating the factors that contribute to the divergent behavioral and social outcomes experienced by racial group members who witness the stereotype-confirming behaviors of ingroup members in interracial (vs. intraracial) interactions. It also examines the burden that racial group members may carry to represent their group positively in these interpersonal interactions and the possible psychological and social consequences of this burden. <br/><br/>Four experimental laboratory studies examine various conditions that may improve performance and facilitate a positive (rather than a negative) interpersonal interaction for ethnic minorities who witness racial group members behaving stereotypically in diverse settings. These studies assess the extent to which: 1) the frequency of positive interracial contact, 2) high vs. low interpersonal closeness with an interaction partner, and 3) interactions with a high vs. a low prejudice partner can improve performance and interpersonal contact in such interactions. Four experimental survey studies then build on this work to explore how majority and minority group members who strategically behave counterstereotypically following ingroup members' stereotype-confirming acts may incur social costs. Ironically, those attempting to rectify the situation may be viewed negatively by same-race members but positively by different-race members.<br/><br/>This work has the potential to transform how we understand people's behavior in novel interracial contexts -- particularly those laden with negative group stereotypes or stereotype-confirming group members -- by providing clear strategies for improving individuals' outcomes and highlighting factors that stand to undermine these positive outcomes. Namely, when individuals of all racial and ethnic backgrounds engage in positive interracial interactions more frequently and actively cultivate cross-race friendships - even with those who may seem to lack egalitarian values - they are likely to thrive emotionally, cognitively, and socially in interracial interactions. Furthermore, these strategies may reduce the burden felt by those who are motivated to maintain positive relationships with both same-race and different-race associates when attempting to counteract racial group members' stereotype-confirming behavior. Thus, this research will assist in the larger goal of working to create and maintain positive intergroup interactions and relationships so that all individuals can thrive in diverse academic and social settings. <br/><br/>Finally, this research meets the goals of NSF to integrate research and education and to include historically underrepresented populations in all stages of the research process. It will be conducted sprimarily at Spelman College, the nation's first historically Black women's Liberal Arts College, and will expose undergraduates to graduate-level research in social psychology. Students will be involved in the creation of the research materials and its implementation, as well as the dissemination of findings at professional conferences, on Spelman's campus, and at other institutions."

Even though racial and ethic diversity in the United States is growing, interracial contact remains relatively rare. Positive interracial contact is important because it has been linked to reductions in prejudice and discrimination and to greater access to intellectual, social and economic capital. When interracial contact occurs, however, research has demonstrated that it is rife with anxiety and discomfort for both racial majority and minority group members. Furthermore, people's anxiety and discomfort during interracial contact has been associated with decreased interest in pursuing future interracial contact. The present research examines how two factors - the racial diversity of an interaction partner's friendship network and the goals that he or she adopts for the interaction - influence people's experiences during interracial interactions. This research proposes a novel, theoretically based model for how these factors independently and collectively influence people's comfort and anxiety when engaged in interracial interactions and their desire to engage in future interracial interactions. <br/><br/>While previous research has examined how racially diverse (vs. homogenous) friendship networks affects interracial interaction expectations, this work examines the role of friendship networks in the context of another situational factor - people's goals for the interaction. Five experimental studies will test whether an interaction partner's racial friendship network (racially diverse or racial homogeneous) and the partner's goals for the interaction (learning or performance goals) influence ethnic minority and White individuals' interaction experiences. In particular, we will measure Black, Hispanic and White college students' experiences of social identity threat, anxiety, and avoidant behavior prior to and during the interaction, as well as their interest in engaging in future interracial interactions. It is hypothesized that an interaction partner who has a racially diverse friend network and who also adopts a learning goal prior to the interaction will reduce participants' social identity threat, anxiety and avoidance behavior, and will foster a more positive interaction. Thus the research will test whether shifts in people's goals within the interaction context can reduce identity threat, opening the door for positive interracial contact?even in the absence of a diverse friendship network. <br/><br/>By exploring the perspectives of majority and minority group members, this research will provide novel theoretical and empirical contributions to the existing literatures on interracial contact and social identity threat by broadening our understanding of the challenges faced by people engaged in interracial contact. Moreover, this research will provide practical guidance on how to better structure interracial interactions to facilitate smoother exchanges and greater enjoyment for both minority and majority group members. This understanding is essential as we enter an age of increased globalization and intergroup contact and as we strive to maintain our competitiveness both at home and internationally. As faculty of color, both PIs are committed to broadening diversity with the sciences and thus serve as role models and mentors for graduate and undergraduate students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds that will be involved in the planning, execution, dissemination, and publication of the research findings."

Despite decades of progress in black-white relations, including a narrowing of the racial gap in socioeconomic status and a steady decline in white Americans' overt expressions of racial animosity, widespread racial inequalities and prejudices persist, and there is some evidence that racial hostility among adolescents is on the rise. This research examines the current status and recent history of intergroup relations among American youth, with a particular focus on the factors that promote positive interracial attitudes and experiences. Drawing on data from a two-decade-long series of nationally representative annual surveys of high school seniors (""Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth""), this project will examine trends in the racial attitudes and interracial experiences of young black and white Americans from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s and test a multivariate explanatory model that links the racial attitudes of youths to their opportunities for interracial contact in a variety of formal and informal settings. The model distinguishes among three key dimensions of interracial contact: opportunities for contact, frequency of contact, and closeness of contact; and among four outcomes: adolescents' perceptions of the relations between blacks and whites, their degree of concern about racial issues, their evaluation of their own personal experiences with members of other races, and their endorsement of interracial ties. By examining the nature, extent, and consequences of interracial contact among young people, this research will provide new insight into the future of American race relations. It will provide needed information about issues of concern to school administrators, community leaders, and others concerned with implementing effective interventions to improve the racial attitudes of adolescents and the racial climate in this country."

What are people's concerns during interracial interactions that keep them from going smoothly? This research takes a social identity threat approach to examine how two factors regulatory focus and situational cuesinfluence people's affective, cognitive and behavioral experiences during interracial interactions. Five experimental studies are proposed under the sponsorship of Dr. Jennifer Richeson at Northwestern University. These studies test causal hypotheses about how identity threat influences affective, cognitive and behavioral outcomes during interracial interactions. The proposed studies will investigate two potential influences on the experiences of social identity threat among Whites and ethnic/racial minorities during interracial interaction: 1) individuals' self-regulatory focus, and 2) situational cues within the interaction context. Ethnic minority and Whites' anxiety before the interactions, behavior during the interactions, and cognitive depletion and satisfaction resulting from the interracial interactions will be measured. Furthermore, we will test whether shifts in regulatory focus and/or particular situational cues in the interaction context can reduce identity threat, opening the door for more positive interracial contact in the future. Taking a relational view of interracial interactions, this work examines the processes by which regulatory focus and situational cues affect experiences of identity threat and its affective, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes from the perspectives of both majority and minority group members. This research will make novel theoretical contributions to the existing literatures on interracial interactions and social identity threat, as well as provide practical guidance about how interracial interactions might be structured to reduce identity threat and facilitate smooth exchange and more enjoyment for both minority and majority group members. In addition, this research will allow the PI to broaden her research focus and learn new methodology and skills under the mentorship of the premier investigator of interracial interactions. Learning interaction methodology and theory from this expert will be a key objective of her training. This research will expand and contribute to identity threat theory and provide a better understanding of the processes by which cues affect the psychology and behaviors present during interracial interactions.

It uses data from the Monitoring the Future survey, a repeated cross-sectional survey of U.S. high school seniors carried out annually since 1976. Data have been collected each year from approximately 125 public and private high schools using a multi-stage cluster sampling procedure to obtain a nationally representative sample of high school seniors. Data for the years 1976-77, 1981-82, 1986-87, and 1991-92 will be analyzed. Across these years, a sample of roughly 26,000 respondents will be obtained. The research will focus specifically on contact between African Americans and Caucasians since these are the only two racial groups identified in the data available. Log-linear models and structural equation models will be used to estimate the hypothesized relationships. The purpose of the research is to examine the effect of interracial contact on racial attitudes among U.S. high school seniors and determine the conditions under which interracial contact fosters racial tolerance. The research has three objectives: (1) to examine the social structural basis of interracial contact, (2) to examine the effects of different types of interracial contact on the perceived quality of interracial contact, and (3) to examine the effects of interracial contact on racial attitudes and the way in which perceptions of the quality of contact condition these effects. Research on how inter-racial contact and racial attitudes are related tests fundamental sociological theories of social influence and the relationship between attitudes and behavior. In seeking to determine whether interracial contact affects racial attitudes and the ways in which such contact is socially structured, this research will provide new information about the consequences of racial segregation in the United States."

People find it difficult to interact with people from other racial groups, because they are concerned with appearing prejudiced or with experiencing prejudice from others. People often perform worse on memory and decision tasks after they interact with people of a different ethnicity, because of regulatory depletion -- a decrease in people's ability to control their thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. The more people try to regulate some aspects of their behavior (e.g., expressions of prejudice), the less able they are to regulate other aspects (e.g., focus on the evidence). Yet studies show that, when White jurors deliberate with minority (versus only White) jurors to judge a minority defendant, they actually remember more case facts and are more accurate. This study will test the effects of interracial deliberations and defendant race (i.e., White or African-American) on jurors' cognitive performance and motivation to reach a fair verdict, guided by the hypothesis that jurors' motivation to avoid racial prejudice in verdicts encourages them to perform their duty as jurors well even when the social interactions are depleting. Such research, which increases understanding of the interpersonal and cognitive processes at the heart of jury deliberations, can inform courts, policy makers, and the public, and better explain jurors' verdict decisions and inform court practices. Results can be used to influence policy recommendations about how to maximize the benefits of diversity by reducing depletion in the jury room.<br/><br/>Specifically, the proposed experimental research relies on social psychological theories of self-regulation to test a model of group deliberation processes to investigate the effects of ethnic diversity on jury decisions. The strength model of self regulation states that people have limited abilities to regulate their behavior, thoughts, and emotions; therefore, regulatory efforts result in cognitive depletion and diminished performance. Using a self-regulation perspective, the proposed research promises to reconcile two sets of contradictory findings: (a) people are depleted after interacting with individuals from other racial groups (Richeson & Shelton, 2003; Richeson & Trawalter, 2005); (b) mixed-race juries are less racially biased and more thoughtful than all-White juries when they judge an African-American defendant (Bowers, Steiner, & Sandys, 2001; Sommers, 2006). What explains this discrepancy? The present project tests several hypotheses: (a) interracial deliberations are more depleting than racially homogeneous ones; (b) White jurors will be particularly depleted when they have to judge an African American defendant in the presence of African American jurors; but (c) White jurors' motivation to avoid being prejudiced against an African-American defendant (particularly when they deliberate with African-American jurors) would overcome their depletion and ensure they perform their jury task well. In a mock jury deliberation paradigm, juries will include 4 participants and either 2 White or 2 African American confederates, resulting in all-White or mixed juries. Jurors will view evidence from a trial in which the defendant will be presented as either White or African American. Jurors will be instructed about the law, then render individual verdicts, deliberate to reach consensus, and complete measures of regulatory depletion (i.e., Stroop test), memory, motivation to reach a fair verdict, implicit and explicit motivation to avoid prejudice, and impressions of other jurors. Videotaped deliberations will be coded to investigate jurors' focus on evidence and valuable contributions as a function of jury composition and defendant race."

Recent research has found that contact across racial and/or cultural divides can sometimes be negative. These types of interactions appear to require additional effort to manage, and consequently often result in mental and emotional fatigue. The research included in this project aims to discover avenues to reduce this potential outcome of interracial contact by investigating the effects of intergroup interactions on Black, White and Latino/a participants (a) with approach-oriented versus avoidance-oriented mindsets, (b) focused on their aspirations for the interaction (promotion-focused) rather than their responsibilities within the interaction (prevention-focused), or (c) with the goal to develop rather than demonstrate positive racial attitudes and intergroup understanding (learning rather than performance goals) during the interaction.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that many individuals find such diverse environments and contact with members of different racial groups both cognitively and emotionally challenging.

However, the feedback needs to be accurate and valid for those benefits to occur. Research by Kent Harber (Rutgers University Newark) and others suggest that this may not be the case for minority learners. There is a ""positive feedback bias"" in the tendency of European-American (White) individuals to provide more praise and less criticism to African American, Latino, and other minority learners than to White learners for work of equal merit. The positive feedback bias appears to be robust and pervasive. It is communicated both in writing and in direct, face-to-face, conversations; it has been displayed by college students, teacher trainees, and public school teachers; and it has been demonstrated in the American West Coast, the Midwest, and the East Coast. The potential costs of such a bias are striking. If feedback is less critical when directed at minorities, it can mislead effort, undermine motivation, and erode trust. If minority students are chronically receiving positively biased feedback, then their ability to advance as learners may be undercut. Perhaps as important, their faith in praise that they have genuinely earned may be compromised. <br/><br/>This line of research will assess how the positive feedback bias, and the motives from which it arises, influence the quality of information that Whites supply to minorities. It specifically focuses on the nature of inter-racial communication, the language used to provide functional feedback, and the reasons why the language used may differ as a function of the interracial context of the exchange. By studying how positive feedback is expressed in open-ended communication, this project may reveal how the positive feedback bias affects minority students' learning and different potential remedies for the bias."

The large number of interracial couples in the U.S. and the limited knowledge of these families prompted this study. It is hypothesized that such interracial families may experience more stress and strain and may be at risk for higher marital instability and lower well-being than same-race families. The major goal of this research is to complement and improve upon existing studies of interracial families. Knowledge of the marital quality and consequences of such marriages may have important social implications. Given that marital quality is highly predictive of divorce, this study will enhance our understanding of it in non-majority populations. Research findings will permit a better accounting of positive benefits of public policies that affect the probability of divorce. Data will be gathered from 3,000 Asians and 500 whites from geographically diverse locations. This will generate a finale sample of approximately 452 couples (i.e.,140 Asian-white couples, 211 Asian couples, 99 whites couples and 2 other white-minority unions) Potential subjects will be contacted by mail and interested subjects will be asked to complete a self-administered mail survey which contains questions on marital quality, and perceived social integration and support. ****"

Less attention, however, has been devoted to how members of socially-devalued groups attempt to manage these interactions and the costs these efforts may entail. The present work examines one strategy that members of racial minorities may adopt in interracial interactions in anticipation of negative treatment by others, with the objective of preempting it. Known as ""covering,"" this self-presentation strategy is one where individuals shift, suppress, or otherwise avoid discussing topics that are closely associated with their group membership during interracial interactions and is designed to reduce any negative reactions that their interaction partners may have to their group membership. This project will examine covering behavior on the part of racial minority (Black and Latino) students of an elite, predominantly White, private university, a context in which these individuals are both numerically underrepresented and culturally devalued. In a series of laboratory studies, this research will examine (1) the extent to which racial minority individuals engage in covering during interactions with and/or communications directed toward racial majority group members, and (2) the potential costs of covering, including feelings of shame, increased loneliness, physiological stress reactions, and impaired cognitive performance.<br/><br/><br/>Given the widespread benefits of increased diversity in educational and employment domains, it is important to understand the experiences of racial minority individuals who attempt to persist and succeed in the face of severe numerical under-representation and prevalent negative group stereotypes. This research, therefore, has the potential to directly benefit institutions of higher education, by informing academic leaders as they seek to increase racial diversity, design environments that facilitate positive interracial contact experiences for all students, and create programs that contribute to minority students' academic success. Insight into these issues will undoubtedly aid in the development of interventions to improve the quality of life of members of racial minority groups who manage to persist in the face of negative group expectations, as well as increase the number of individuals who are able to do so."

Previous work by the PI shows that Whites provide less criticism and more praise to Blacks than to Whites for work of equal merit. The current research program is designed to determine the cause of this positive feedback bias. Specifically, it tests whether the bias is motivated by Whites' efforts to protect their own egalitarian self-images. These egalitarian motives have been implicated as a cause of out-group deference in other contexts, and the PI's earlier studies strongly hinted that these motives might affect interracial feedback. However, the influence of egalitarian motives on interracial feedback has not yet been directly tested. <br/><br/>The funded research includes two experiments that test whether egalitarian self-image concerns contribute to the positive feedback bias. Study 1 will test whether the feedback bias is decreased when feedback suppliers' egalitarianism has been validated. Study 2 will test whether the feedback bias is increased when feedback supplier's egalitarianism has been challenged, especially by the race-related content of the work being evaluated. <br/><br/>In addition to testing the egalitarian motive hypothesis, these studies will explore whether the positive feedback bias applies to minorities other than Blacks (specifically Latinos). The studies will also test whether teacher trainees, who will regularly deliver academic feedback upon assumption of their teaching duties, demonstrate the positive bias. This research may help us understand the positive feedback bias and why minority students are chronically under-challenged. This bias may erode minority students' faith in praise they legitimately earn."

Previous research has documented the dramatic impact that individuals' attitudes and stereotypes can have on the dynamics of intergroup interactions. The majority of this work, however, has taken an ""individualistic"" approach, insofar as researchers study one side of the dyadic intergroup interaction. The current research takes a step beyond this approach by studying intergroup interactions from the perspective of both Whites and Blacks simultaneously. This work will focus on how Whites' concerns about appearing prejudiced, and Blacks' concerns about being the target of prejudice, shape their own and their partner's affective and cognitive outcomes during interracial interactions. Specifically, a paradoxical model of interracial interactions is proposed which predicts that Whites' and Blacks' concerns with prejudice negatively impact their own experiences in interracial interactions, but positively impact their partners' experiences. Moreover, the proposed research will examine the mediating factor of behavioral regulation in the relationship between interpersonal concerns with prejudice and affective and cognitive outcomes. It is predicted that Whites who are concerned with appearing prejudiced attempt to control their nonverbal and verbal behaviors, which is what leads to the differential impact in the dyad members' experiences. Similarly, it is predicted that Blacks who are concerned about being the target of prejudice use compensatory behavioral strategies, which lead to the differential impact in the dyad members' experiences. These studies will enrich our theoretical understanding of intergroup contact. Moreover, the research will provide information to help improve the psychological well-being of underrepresented ethnic minority groups during interpersonal interactions."

Often gentrification is characterized by whites moving into predominantly black neighborhoods, resulting - at least for a time - in racially diverse neighborhoods. The main objective of this project is to examine neighborhood racial integration by analyzing how long-time residents react to gentrification, both in terms of whether they stay in their neighborhood (resulting in stable racial integration) and whether they socially interact with and participate in the same neighborhood organizations as newcomers (resulting in genuine social integration). The central hypothesis is that, among long-time black residents, homeowners are more likely to stay in the neighborhood and socially integrate with newcomers than are renters. The investigator will conduct 80 interviews in two racially diverse, gentrifying neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon. These interviews complement a survey of 658 residents that was recently conducted. Interviewees will be selected from a list of survey respondents. All will have lived in their neighborhood since before gentrification began, and they will fall under one of four categories: black homeowners, white homeowners, black renters, and white renters. Interviewer and interviewee will be matched based on race. This research will make both scholarly and policy contributions, especially to sociology. In terms of its scholarly contribution, it will examine whether long-time residents' reactions to newcomers are based more on cultural characteristics or on economic interests. Researchers who emphasize the importance of culture argue that differences in racial identity and education create divisions between newcomers and long-time residents, making it difficult to achieve racial stability and social integration. However, researchers who emphasize the importance of economics argue that homeowners benefit financially from gentrification and therefore, regardless of cultural differences, would be more likely to stay in the neighborhood and be more socially integrated with newcomers than would renters. This study also has important policy implications for it may be the case that homeownership serves three important functions in racially integrated, gentrifying neighborhoods: (1) securing affordable housing for long-time residents, including blacks, (2) maintaining stable neighborhood integration, and (3) increasing social integration between long-time black residents and newer white, middle-class residents. Many Americans are pessimistic about the coexistence of whites and blacks. To some degree this pessimism is the result of a lack of knowledge regarding inter-racial ""contact situations"" that, on a daily basis, offer a fertile ground for the emergence of a new, non-racial, U.S. culture. The broader impacts of this study of integrated neighborhoods will generate a greater understanding of pathways out of this great American dilemma, including understanding whether homeownership facilitates stable racial integration and inter-racial social integration."

Photographs and television images vary in their clarity and contrast; faces of others vary in their symmetry; and concepts, people, and settings vary in their familiarity. All of these variables (clarity, symmetry, familiarity), among others, increase fluency and have been shown to lead to more favorable evaluations. In fact, research has repeatedly shown that fluently-processed objects are evaluated more favorably than are their less fluently processed counterparts. Yet surprisingly, little research has aimed to uncover the possible behavioral consequences of fluency. This research explores this possibility. <br/><br/>Three lines of research will examine the role of fluency in guiding social behaviors operating at the individual, interpersonal, and intergroup levels, namely, goal pursuit, mimicry, and intergroup contact. The proposed framework suggests that fluent processing of an object leads to more favorable evaluation and that this positive evaluation drives behavior. Specifically, because positive goals are more prone to be pursued and because liked individuals are more prone to be approached and mimicked, this framework suggests that increasing the fluent processing of these stimuli should increase one's willingness to pursue a goal, mimic an interaction partner, and approach a racial outgroup member. Each of these hypotheses will be tested in multiple studies. Because of its focus on behavioral rather than evaluative outcomes, this work promises to advance the fluency literature in a novel and important direction. <br/><br/>This research has broader impacts as well. Some of the proposed studies examine how fluency promotes positive interracial contact. Uncovering effective prejudice and discrimination reduction techniques has been a long-standing challenge for social psychologists, scholars in other fields of social justice, and society at large. To the extent that these findings uncover means to improve intergroup relations, they will be beneficial to parents, educators, and policy makers who strive to create and encourage interracial harmony. Additionally, this research serves in the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and thus will contribute to the educational enrichment of these developing scholars."

By focusing on social relationships in an integrated neighborhood, we move beyond traditional studies of segregation research that use segregation indices, such as the dissimilarity index. Additionally, this study examines how the concept of social distance, which highlights social interaction between groups, may explain the quantity and quality of encounters between black, white, and Latino residents. This project will assess the social environment of an integrated neighborhood by documenting and questioning the attitudes, behaviors, and relationships of neighborhood residents. These data will be collected through neighborhood observations, in-depth interviews with residents, and a neighborhood-wide survey. Lastly, data will be analyzed using modified grounded theory, a process that uses data and existing theory to develop concepts and new theories (Charmaz 2006). <br/><br/>The proposed analysis addresses two major limitations of segregation research: two group comparisons (e.g. black-white) and Census data-based analyses (Ellen 1998). By studying neighborhood life in an integrated neighborhood through the proposed research design, this study highlights an element absent from cross-city comparisons: people. Furthermore, since this research is taking place in a new destination for Latino migration, it emphasizes the experience of recently migrated Latinos (Parrado and Flippen 2005). How Latino residents are incorporated and understood by their neighbors, as well as how migrants understand their own experiences inside this neighborhood are of particular interest. The recent arrival of Latin American migrants provides an opportunity to see how an area with an existing racial dynamic adjusts to the introduction of a new group (Kim 1999). <br/><br/>Additionally, Durham's population shifts from a biracial to a multi-ethnic city parallel demographic changes in other growing American cities. Studying this experience is essential to understanding the future of immigration and segregation in this country (Hirschman and Massey 2008:3). <br/><br/>Lastly, Federal programs like HOPE VI, a Public and Indian Housing program promoting mixed-income communities, follow in the tradition of sociological research on integration (US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Home and Communities; Wilson 1987) and may benefit from the proposed project's findings. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. This project will provide new and policy-relevant information on social life in an integrated neighborhood."

These initial steps in the investigation of the residential geography of mixed-race households set the stage for us to address two derivative questions. How does the increase in mixed-race partnering affect levels of residential segregation in neighborhoods? It may be that the rise in mixed-race partnerships due to interracial contact outside neighborhoods (such as at college or work) drives down levels of residential segregation within neighborhoods. Do the residential choices of mixed-race couples have implications for the way they racially/ethnically identify their multiracial children? Residence in a neighborhood dominated by a single racial/ethnic group may encourage mixed-race couples to identify their children as members of that group.

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship (under the ""Broadening Participation"" track of the SBE postdoctoral fellowships program) trains a young scientist exploring the effects of cross-race friendships in early and middle childhood. Despite its history of civil right progress, the U.S. continues to be plagued by racial inequalities, racial discrimination, and racial tensions. Finding solutions to these problems is critical to the country's social and economic wellbeing and will require cross-race cooperation based on trust, respect, and goodwill. Fostering cross-race friendships among youth is likely to facilitate cooperative work toward racial equality and justice. Past research has shown that cross-race friendships reduce negative racial attitudes. More positive racial attitudes and interracial interactions may, in turn, reduce the future prevalence of discrimination, which is linked to negative physical and mental health outcomes. Studying ways to encourage the frequency and quality of cross-race friendships in childhood may provide educators, parents, and policy-makers with effective methods of encouraging positive racial attitudes and openness to cross-race friendships at a point in development during which such attitudes are flexible. Given that the prevalence of cross-race friendships decreases across childhood (Aboud, Mendelson, & Purdy, 2003), the proposed work aims to understand the formation and function of cross-race friendships in early and middle childhood among youth from diverse racial backgrounds.<br/><br/>The specific aims of the two proposed studies are to: (1) understand the ways in which parents' and children's attitudes and behaviors predict children's willingness to initiate cross-race interaction and the nature of such interactions, (2) identify qualities of cross-race interactions that promote cross-race friendships, and (3) explore whether cross-race friendships uniquely and causally predict improvement in racial attitudes over and above other types of cross-race contact. The first study explores whether children's endorsement of racial stereotypes and their beliefs regarding whether individuals of different racial groups are different in underlying structural and fundamental ways (i.e., racial essentialism) relate to their willingness to adopt, and their treatment of, cross-race versus same-race pen pals. This study also examines whether parental characteristics, including their valuing of diversity, the messages that they send their children about race, and the racial diversity of their neighborhoods and social networks predict children's pen pal selection and behavior. The second study extends the first by using an experimental methodology to examine the causal effects of children?s cross-race interactions and friendships on their racial attitudes (i.e., stereotypes and essentialist views). Same and cross-race dyads are brought into a lab setting and randomly assigned to interact under conditions of: (1) mere contact, (2) academic cooperation, and (3) friendship induction. This study examines whether these contextual manipulations lead to friendship formation, and in turn, a reduction in racial stereotyping and racially essentialist attitudes. These studies extend the current understanding of the nature and benefits of cross-race friendships in childhood in three ways. First, study 1 examines the antecedents of children's willingness to befriend and behave positively toward cross-race individuals rather than focusing on how cross-race friendships predict attitudes, as has been the focus of much previous work. Second, instead of relying solely on correlational associations, study 2 explores the causal links between cross-race friendships and racial attitudes. Finally, both studies extend previous work by exploring the formation and benefits of cross-race friendships among a diverse population, including African American, Latino, and White children."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising scholar in the field of social psychology researching racial bias. There are many perspectives about the operation of racial bias in society, and yet, people often shirk away from conversations about racial issues-of-the-day because they can be tense and uncomfortable. Indeed, disagreement during conversations about racial bias typically engenders defensiveness, anger, and withdrawal?other-focused emotions that inhibit perspective-taking and downstream attitudinal and behavioral change. This research program combines social psychological scholarship on confronting racial bias, self-regulation, and interracial interactions to identify strategies that will temper these feelings of defensiveness. More specifically, this project explores how Whites respond to different styles of feedback (i.e., confrontation) during conversations about bias. Additionally, this project explicitly tests whether self-regulation training that provides insight into one?s own propensity for racial bias will improve Whites? reactions to confrontation. Achieving greater insight into how confrontation targets feel and respond in face-to-face interactions, and whether this differs based on the race of the confronter or the style that individual uses, can inform ways to engage majority group allies when working toward racial equality and social change. An additional benefit of this work is its applicability for creating diversity and inclusion workshops that promote self-driven change, instead of ones that result in other-focused (i.e., defensive) reactions that can lead to backlash. Taken together, this research will provide practical knowledge about how to confront and discuss racial bias in ways that will motivate individuals toward social change and foster mutual understanding of the relevance and prevalence of racial bias in today?s society.<br/><br/>The present studies advance social psychological theory by exploring how people respond to different types of racial bias confrontation. Building on self-determination theory and the self-regulation model of prejudice, four experiments empirically test how Whites respond to confrontation that emphasizes compliance with social norms (i.e., a controlling strategy) compared to confrontation that emphasizes compliance with personal egalitarian standards (i.e., an autonomy-supportive strategy). The first study uses a free-recall paradigm to explore whether Whites spontaneously distinguish between autonomy-supportive and controlling confrontations, and how this affects their attitudes, behavior, and perceptions of racial bias confronters. The subsequent experiments test whether safety cues from the confronter (i.e., shared racial group) and safety cues from the self (i.e., training that emphasize one?s propensity for racial bias and self-regulation) temper negative reactions to controlling racial bias confrontation. The final study mimics real-world conversations about race by examining how Whites respond to face-to-face confrontation, and whether safety cues (from others, and the self) encourage more positive, perceivable differences in the confrontation target?s behavior. In sum, the present research extends past work by identifying when and why racial bias confrontation interferes with self-regulatory processes, and by creating ways to intervene to encourage engagement in future intergroup contact."

The study of implicit processes has been especially prevalent in the area of stereotyping and prejudice where researchers have determined that attitudes and associations activated implicitly may be consistent with or strikingly contradictory to attitudes activated explicitly. For example, White people's explicit attitudes may lead them to espouse egalitarian and non-prejudiced attitudes toward African Americans. However, various cognitive, motivational and social processes can simultaneously lead to negative implicit attitudes and stereotypic associations in relation to African Americans. These associations have been linked to discriminatory outcomes in many domains, including education, psychological health, employment outcomes, medical care, and policing. Therefore, understanding how implicit biases can be changed is critically important not only for advances in our knowledge of attitudes, but also for reducing the pervasive consequences of implicit prejudice. <br/><br/>The purpose of the research in this grant is to improve understanding of the potential effectiveness of different strategies for changing implicit attitudes, the time course and persistence of change brought about through these strategies, as well as the underlying processes through which change may be achieved. In addition, the research examines the effects of implicit bias reduction strategies on judgmental and evaluative behavioral outcomes in short and long term contexts, and with respect to interracial interactions. The first set of experiments examines the effectiveness of intergroup bias reduction strategies among Whites. The second set of experiments examines the effects of the change strategies on judgmental and evaluative behavioral outcomes. The final set of experiments focuses on the outcomes of implicit bias change among members of stereotyped groups who have negative implicit biases related to their own group. Ultimately, this research will advance current understanding of the interplay of automatic and controlled processes by providing and testing a framework of implicit bias change."

Although these neighborhoods are similarly impacted by a natural disaster and receive similar types of aid through a large NGO (non-governmental organizations) and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), the racial and economic characteristics of these neighborhoods are quite different. The researcher will examine the social processes through which race and class shape whether and how residents strike close and informal connections with disaster responders. The research in particular focuses on how the type and quality of relationships formed, affects sharing of non-official disaster support and information. This focus on these newly formed connections is particularly important in this environment, where people's usual social connections were severely compromised. The research adopts a theory of network resources, social capital, which expects that assistance in the form of information or resources are informally and indirectly accessed through these interpersonal connections and that social position of one's connections and the quality of their relationship matter in this process. <br/><br/>The co-PI will conduct fieldwork in disaster relief and warming centers and surrounding devastated areas of two urban neighborhoods that are proximate to each other. Beginning only ten days after the hurricane and through 8 subsequent visits to the field site over the course of several months, the researcher interviewed 120 participants, including impacted residents, local community and out-of-town responders and volunteers. The data for this project is collected in three ways: (1) in-depth unstructured interviews, (2) semi-structured follow-up interviews, (3) and ethnographic participant observation. These are substantiated with documentary evidence of material culture including video and photographs of devastation, signs, flyers, and other print informational materials at relief sites. Through interviews and observations, the research will examine how cross-race and cross-class interactions, and community racial and class dynamics, impact the extent and kind of disaster support residents receive. Observations and inquiry will be used to first identify, then explain the relationships among (1) the types and strength of relationships forged among impacted-residents and disaster responders and volunteers; (2) the types of disaster-related information and resources shared across these connections; (3) the racial and class content of resident and volunteer conversations, accounts and interactions and (4) the aspects of local disaster response that structure interpersonal relations and resident participation.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the project contributes to four fields of sociological research: social capital theory, race relations, poverty, and disaster research. The unique design of the study allows for distinguishing the mechanisms linking the entire process of social capital to pinpoint at what stage (creation, access, activation and returns) social capital inequality occurs in the non-routine context of disaster. This emphasis differs from current research in this tradition, which explores one leg (e.g. activation) of the process in routine contexts such as job-finding. The research also addresses a key substantive debate on how urban poor Blacks and other minorities end up in the ""wrong networks"" whether it is through choice or opportunity. Or as explored here, to what extent is this phenomenon a network level process?<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Beyond its theoretical contribution of examining social capital and social inequality outside routine contexts, this research has tremendous social significance as it informs practitioners of the interracial and inter-class dynamics of ""networking"" in devastated neighborhoods and the consequence for accessing available resources. This project will also enable a minority female qualitative researcher to establish and organize a substantial qualitative dataset and launch an independent-research agenda on racial-ethnic social capital inequalities within diverse populations in non-routine contexts. The qualitative dataset, will be used to train both undergraduate and graduate students in qualitative analytical methods, race and class inequalities, and the consequence of disasters for vulnerable populations. Findings from this project will be published in peer reviewed journals, and presented at academic and public conferences. The insights gained from this project, will also spur extension of similar analyses to other environments that are racially and socioeconomically diverse."

Reactions to Gentrification<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This research project will collect data from 80 interviews in two racially diverse, gentrifying neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon to examine the linkages between race and ownership in explaining gentrification outcomes. Gentrification, the process of wealthier residents moving into a poorer neighborhood in sufficient numbers to transform its social identity, is occurring in parts of many U.S. cities. Often gentrification is characterized by whites moving into predominantly black neighborhoods, resulting?at least for a time?in racially diverse neighborhoods. The main goal of this project is to examine neighborhood racial integration by analyzing how long-time businesses and organizations react to gentrification in their neighborhood, in terms of whether they continue to operate in their neighborhood (thus facilitating stable racial integration) and whether newcomers become involved in their business/ organization, as workers or customers (thus facilitating genuine social integration). The central hypothesis is that, among long-time predominantly black businesses/ organizations, those that own their own building are more likely to stay in the neighborhood and socially integrate with newcomers. <br/><br/>The interviews will complement a recent survey of 164 businesses/organizations that will be selected from a list of survey respondents. All will have operated in their neighborhood since before gentrification began and they will correspond to one of four categories: black-owned, white-owned, black renters, and white renters. Interviewer and interviewee will be matched based on race. This research will make both scholarly and policy contributions. In terms of scholarly contribution, it will examine whether long-time businesses/organizations? reactions to newcomers are based more on cultural characteristics or on economic interests. Researchers who emphasize the importance of culture argue that differences in racial identity and socioeconomic status create divisions between newcomers and long-time businesses/organizations, making it difficult to achieve racial stability and social integration. However, researchers who emphasize the importance of economics argue that businesses/organizations benefit financially from gentrification and therefore, regardless of cultural differences, those that own their building are more likely to stay in the neighborhood and be more open to newcomers than those that rent. This study also has important policy implications for it may be that ownership serves three important functions in racially integrated, gentrifying neighborhoods: (1) securing affordable space for long-time businesses/organizations, including predominantly black ones, (2) maintaining stable neighborhood integration, and (3) increasing social integration. The broader impacts of this study of integrated neighborhoods will generate a greater understanding of pathways out of racial segregation, including understanding whether ownership facilitates stable racial integration and inter-racial social integration."

The psychometric properties of the existing racial attitude measures for children in this age group are problematic, which has served to limit the interdisciplinary understanding of racial prejudice. One fundamental limitation of existing racial attitude measures is that all employ a two-option, forced-choice response format to measure attitudes. Forced-choice formats confound conceptually distinct phenomena, such as ingroup preference and outgroup disparagement. To disentangle this confound, the project will employ a multi-item response format. The primary objectives of this project are: (1) to establish the reliability and validity the racial attitudes instrument and (2) to assess the profiles of young children's attitudes toward Black and White racial groups. Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing (ACASI) will be the modality through which the instrument is delivered. ACASI is an innovative method that enhances data quality and data collection procedures. The racial attitudes index will employ a picture-story approach to assess children's racial attitudes. The instrument will display a set of 28 photographic images of Black and White children. The photographic images will represent children in racially mixed pairs as a voice over reads mini stories about each image. A total of 360 subjects will participate in formative and evaluative activities.<br/><br/>The results of this project will be used to construct another ACASI measure called the Interracial and Ethnic Attitudes Index (IREAX). The IREAX will be designed for five-to-nine-year-olds and will use photographic images of targets from several racial and ethnic groups (e.g., Asian, Black, Latino, Native American, and White). To date, limited research has examined attitudes across and toward multiple racial and ethnic groups. The concentrated focus on attitudes toward Black and White racial groups limits the understanding of attitudes toward other racial and ethnic groups. The data from the RAI and IREAX should advance the understanding of the contours of racial bias. Childhood is the time in which racial attitudes are most malleable. Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of children's attitudes for the development of educational and policy interventions. The aims of this study should assist in efforts to ameliorate societal tensions surrounding race and ethnicity. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

However, people often express ambivalence on important social topics -- attitudes that contain a mixture of both positive and negative sentiments. For example, research over the past 20 years has shown that many Americans are ambivalent in their attitudes toward racial minorities and toward physically disabled persons. Ambivalence helps to explain why a person might sometimes treat members of a stigmatized group in a favorable or helpful way, and at other times in an unfavorable or hurtful way. The present research addresses two important but unresolved problems in research on attitude ambivalence. The problem is that satisfactory methods do not yet exist for measuring ambivalence. Thus, one part of this research focuses on developing a valid and reliable measurement procedure. The new procedure will facilitate research progress and can be applied in ongoing efforts to document and archive public opinion on important social concerns. The second problem is that relatively little is known about the structure and function of ambivalent attitudes. it is currently believed that ambivalence is caused by a conflict in fundamental values, and that people truly adhere to both positive and negative sentiments at the same time. However, ambivalence may also reflect poorly developed social attitudes, or it may reflect deliberate efforts to present whatever social image is most desired at the time. This research seeks to distinguish among the alternative explanations by studying cognitive processes associated with the storage and retrieval of ambivalent attitudes. The studies will provide a deeper understanding of why people often hold ambivalent attitudes. Ultimately, the research will provide a theoretical basis for developing interventions that promote interracial harmony, that encourage healthful lifestyles, and that mobilize the Nation's efforts to remove the social and physical barriers that often confront disabled persons."

Several factors have fundamentally changed the mating market in the past 50 years in ways that require a new, in-depth study of how people meet their mates. First, Americans are now marrying later than ever before. Second, the life course of young adulthood is now a more complex and winding road including travel away from home and college education. Third, the types of families young adults form seem to be changing- witness the rise of interracial marriage and same-sex unions. Fourth, new technologies such as the Internet provide new ways of meeting romantic partners. Fifth, research from Europe suggests that recent marriage cohorts have met in different ways from their parents and grandparents. This project gathers new nationally representative data on how couples meet. The survey of couple formation includes detailed questions about when, where, and how couples met, and what social connections or institutions (such as family, school, or work) brought them together. The study of how couples meet will be followed by one and two year follow-ups with all couples identified in the initial study. The first study will provide data on different types of couples and how they met (for example: through the Internet, through family connections, through church, or through work). The follow-up studies will determine couple dissolution rates (i.e., breakup rates). The data on couple dissolution will enable scholars to determine how legal status (civil unions, for example) affects couple stability for same-sex couples.<br/><br/>The study will collect new information not only on how couples meet, but also on the question of whether couple dissolution rates vary by how couples meet. These data will be publicly available through ICPSR (Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research) and Stanford University website.."

Over this period racial disparities in educational attainment and household income have narrowed, racial attitudes have changed considerably, and a significant population of middle class African Americans has emerged. Despite this, a high degree of racial segregation in residential patterns remains a striking feature of the urban landscape. This research deals with the causes, consequences and measurement of residential segregation in the United States. The research has three distinct components. The first is a theoretical exploration of the manner in which racial disparities in the distribution of income interact with preferences over neighborhood racial composition to determine patterns of segregation and stratification in metropolitan areas. This complex relationship is being investigated through the development and analysis of models of decentralized neighborhood sorting. The second component is an investigation of the implications of segregation for the intergenerational transmission of racial inequality. Earlier findings suggest that black households experience poorer neighborhood quality in comparison with white households belonging to the same income class. The project explores the manner in which current racial disparities in neighborhood quality influence future disparities in educational attainment and labor market success. These effects are being examined in the context of models of neighborhood sorting which take into account the acquisition of knowledge and skills within families, schools, and communities. The third and final component of the research deals with the measurement of segregation. This involves the use of a method for the decomposition of segregation measures into two components. One of these can be interpreted as the component of segregation that can be attributed to the effect of racial income disparities alone, while the other captures the combined effect of neighborhood preferences and discrimination. Using this method, disaggregated data on income distributions by race at the neighborhood level is being used to examine variations across cities and over time in the two components of measured segregation.<br/><br/> The research findings will allow us to account for the persistence of segregation in certain cities, assess the prospects for integration in the future, and evaluate the implications and potential effectiveness of integrationist policies. The persistence of segregation in the face of narrowing racial income disparities has led some researchers to argue that racial attitudes are still quite intolerant, or that discrimination in real estate and mortgage lending markets is still widespread. This research will demonstrate, in contrast, that persistently high levels of segregation are consistent with narrowing income disparities even when preferences are pro-integrationist and discrimination is not widespread. This is possible because the relationship between neighborhood racial preferences and segregation depends in subtle ways on both intraracial and interracial disparities in income. As racial income disparities narrow, segregated cities become less stratified by income and hence the economic incentives for integration are diminished. The research also sheds light on the reasons why black households experience lower neighborhood quality than white households of comparable incomes, and why the incomes of black households underpredict the future economic success of their children relative to white households. This has implications for the extent to which racial disparities in income and education can be diminished by the adoption of race-blind social policies. Finally, the empirical component of the research will shed light on the extent to which the modest and uneven declines in segregation over the period 1970 to 2000 can be attributed primarily to changes in racial inequality or to changes in other factors, such as an increased desire on the part of Americans of all groups to live in more integrated communities."

Rates more than doubled in the remaining years of the 1990s to 5.2 percent in 2000. Against this backdrop, this project investigates the neighborhood geographies of mixed-race couples. The extensive literature on US urban residential segregation that investigates issues of neighborhood choice and constraint for members of racial and ethnic groups has yet to examine, theoretically or empirically, the residential choices of mixed-race partners. This project seeks to answer a number of basic theoretical and empirical questions. Do the processes that generate and sustain segregation, as we currently understand them, apply to mixed-race households? Do mixed-race families live in segregated or diverse neighborhoods? Do they live in neighborhoods dominated by a particular race/ethnic group? Does this depend on the race of the male partner or the female partner? Do the social class positions of the partners affect the couple's residential choices? These initial steps in the investigation of the residential geography of mixed-race households set the stage for us to address two derivative questions. How does the increase in mixed-race partnering affect levels of residential segregation in neighborhoods? It may be that the rise in mixed-race partnerships due to interracial contact outside neighborhoods (such as at college or work) drives down levels of residential segregation within neighborhoods. Do the residential choices of mixed-race couples have implications for the way they racially/ethnically identify their multiracial children? Residence in a neighborhood dominated by a single racial/ethnic group may encourage mixed-race couples to identify their children as members of that group. This project will investigate the racial/ethnic identification choices that mixed-race couples make for their multiracial children across an array of racially identified places.<br/><br/>This project will provide the first glimpse of the neighborhood geographies of mixed-race households in both 1990 and 2000. The ability to investigate these geographies has been limited to date because publicly available census data provide no information on household structure at neighborhood scales. Recently released restricted access data from the long forms of the 1990 and 2000 Censuses provide such data, allowing us to advance significantly our understanding of racial segregation, urban social geographies, and the construction of racial identity in mixed-race families."

Even so, research on the economic development of U.S. immigration gateways and ?global cities? has paid scant attention to how new immigrant elites in these enclaves mobilize transnational capital and work in collaboration with public officials and economic development organizations to promote land intensification and development in economically-stagnant neighborhoods. This research examines the emergence of pro-growth coalitions made up of immigrant entrepreneurs, political leaders, large-scale developers, and transnational investors from the Pacific Rim that have built their fortunes around luxury condos, office buildings, high-end restaurants, and other profitable ventures in fast-growing ethnic enclave economies. It will evaluate how such economic development ties in with the commercialization of culture, the privatization and fortressing of public spaces, environmental damage, heightened segregation between the rich and the poor, and impacts on workers and residents, The study involves an intensive case study of two highly-developed ethnic enclave economies in the Korean entrepreneurial center of Koreatown and the Chinese core of Monterey Park, Los Angeles--both of which have experienced rapid growth and (re)development as a result of their ties to the global economy. The findings will inform local government officials and policymakers regarding working with immigrant leaders on issues of economic development and devising strategies for balanced growth to reduce overdevelopment, environmental damage and interracial conflict.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to identify the main characteristics of the immigrant elite, their strategies for promoting their agenda to the local government, and the resulting impact on social relations and inequality in a racially-diverse metropolis. Data come from 120 semi-structured interviews with the major leaders for and against development, including transnational agents, local elite, public and quasi-public authorities, community-based organizations, and residents/ activists. Data also include census and other secondary materials, which describe the steady progression of enclave growth, the political characteristics and influence of residents and businesses, and the demographic backdrop for gentrification, displacement and potential neighborhood conflicts. The findings will advance understanding of the politics of land use, investment and development which are increasingly linked to economies beyond U.S. borders as a result of real estate investment from overseas, and how this can delocalize decision-making processes away from municipal governments and complicate local growth control efforts.<br/><br/>&#8195;"

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship trains a young scientist exploring the strategies for mitigating certain threats that arise due to intergroup mentoring, which is often the case for under-represented minorities in the STEM fields. This fellowship support is under the ""Broadening Participation"" track of the SBE postdoctoral fellowships program.<br/><br/>Under-represented minorities (URMs) perform lower than their majority-group counterparts across STEM domains. One factor that may contribute to URMs? underperformance is that they are typically mentored by majority-group members, a result of the numerical underrepresentation of URM faculty and upper-level management in STEM. Critically, the intergroup nature of these mentoring relationships is likely to activate discrimination-related threats and negative affect for both mentors and mentees. Specifically, majority-group individuals often worry about being perceived as prejudiced, and URMs in historically stigmatized contexts often worry that they will face discrimination. Consequently, rather than creating an opportunity for professional growth, intergroup mentoring may present a threat for both mentors and mentees, and impede progress for URMs in STEM. The goal of the current research is to promote academic and professional success for URMs in STEM, and thus increase rates of URM participation to generate a larger and more diverse STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The current research attempts to mitigate the threats experienced during intergroup mentoring through self-distancing. Self-distancing is a self-regulatory strategy wherein a person observes and analyzes the self from a 3rd person perspective, and has been shown to reduce negative affect, and improve communication skills. In the current studies, White and URM participants adopt the role of mentors and students, respectively, and interact with one another. Additionally, we manipulate the degree to which participants view their mentoring interaction from a self-distanced perspective. To understand the physiological mechanisms through which self-distancing influences mentoring outcomes, the current research examines neural and immune reactivity. Furthermore, to test the longer-term behavioral consequences of neural and immune reactivity during a mentoring interaction, participants return to the lab for a one-week follow-up session. These studies have the potential to reveal basic mechanisms that drive important outcomes in interracial mentoring relationships."

Race in Place: Evaluating the Process of Residential Integration<br/><br/>0825024<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>This research project will examine how living in a diverse community shapes the racial makeup of residents? local social networks qualitatively and quantitatively. Data collection will involve in-depth interviews with thirty key informants, ethnographic fieldwork, including extensive participant observation, and 120 social networks interviews with residents in Riverwest, a stably-integrated neighborhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Currently, there is little empirical investigation of the neighborhood-level relationship between residential integration?the co-existence of racial and ethnic groups in a community?and social integration?meaningful and/or useful cross-race ties. Thus, scholars do not know whether increasing demographic integration leads to the many assumed benefits of integration on interracial interaction and exchange (e.g. resource sharing, improved racial relations, increased access to social and cultural capital that support social mobility). This research will address the following research questions: How do local organizations (commercial, civic, religious, social service) in a residentially-integrated neighborhood facilitate cross-race social integration and/or reinforce social segregation? How do residents of a residentially-integrated neighborhood ?frame? (assign meaning to) their neighborhood? How do these understandings of the neighborhood affect how residents act in and toward their neighborhood? The goal of the research is to explain how residents of a residentially-integrated neighborhood make social distinctions within their local context and provide insight into how symbolic boundaries affect resident interactions of the neighborhood (e.g., where to go, how to interact, whom to interact with or avoid, how to deal with problems). Overall, the research aims to advance sociological understanding of social and cultural processes central to the perpetuation of inequality and to the promotion of equality by grounding these processes in a diverse residential context. By identifying local practices and organizational features that limit or enhance the development of interethnic ties, the research will suggest policies that could support the successful integration of neighborhoods and maximize the benefits of integration."

The REU site's 10-week program will host a diverse group of undergraduate students to work jointly in the Comparative Cognition and Social Cognitive Development Labs at Yale University. The REU students participate in all aspects of the research process: research design, subject recruitment, stimulus generation, data collection, data entry, coding, and statistical analysis. In addition, students have the opportunity to interact as colleagues: participating in weekly lab meetings, reading current literature, contributing to theoretical discussions regarding the comparative and developmental origins of social cognition, and attending a professional development series focusing on topics such as applying to graduate school, getting the most out of their undergraduate career, etc. Students meet weekly with a graduate student mentor, and the PI and co-PI attend bi-monthly social events. A primary objective of this REU site is to include students who have fewer research opportunities, including those attending non-Research universities and students from underrepresented groups and first generation college students.
