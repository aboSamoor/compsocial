Preliminary planning activities include: literature review, site location, necessary permissions and collaborating institutions, experimentation with methodologies, preliminary data gathering, data analysis and interpretation, experiment redesign and writing of final proposal. Activities during the first year will involve the comparison of 3 management systems: 1) Traditional agroforestry system with a variety of shade trees interplanted with coffee; 2) the agroforestry system with just one shade tree species intensively managed through periodic pruning; and 3) monocultural coffee with no shade tree. Representative farms will be selected. Base-line data related to ant assemblages, insect pest and disease densities and distributions will be gathered using standard sampling methods. Photon flux density and CO2 uptake will be calculated directly using the Solarcal computer program. Satellite photographs will be used to determine the area of the country planted in the monocultural system. The effect of nitrogen fertilization and the effect of pesticide insecticide applications on the ant assemblage and on pests will be studied in subsequent years."

Naturalization rates not only measure the number of new citizens in a society, but also measure the extent to which states and societies formally integrate minorities into their realm. As such, naturalization rules and rates will have a large influence on: the quality of life of immigrants and their children, on ethnic conflict and social solidarity, on attempts at social control, and on the recent efforts at transnational unification (e.g., European Union citizenship and the possibility of North American citizenship). Given the importance of these issues, why do some countries willingly integrate and others block the transformation of strangers into full-fledged citizens? This proposal uses a political economy and institutional framework to explain naturalization rates in 20 countries, and collects new data on naturalization rates and innovative explanatory variables.<br/><br/> Naturalization rates are explained using three methodological approaches-comparative/historical analysis of law and institutions; four case studies; and pooled time series analysis. First, from a comparative historical analysis of law and institutions, it is hypothesized that experiences with colonization and settlement cause high naturalization rates, while non-colonizers have no particular reason to integrate strangers into their country. The main explanatory factors are: colonization from 1855-1955, indigenous population decline from 1800-1920 as a measure of settler country labor supply, and a barrier index to naturalization constructed from national laws. Cross-national regression procedure will be used to explain a major part of the variance in naturalization rates from 1970-95. Controls are used for economic, demographic, cultural, and other variables, and arguments are made against the impact of immigration itself as an explanation of naturalization.<br/><br/> Second, in four case studies using Millsean methods, pairs of culturally similar countries are examined to identify the institutional mechanisms that affected multi-cultural approaches to naturalization. In a comparison of the primary colonizers of France and the UK, the effects of the method of colonization and the elite decisions to pursue citizenship for a larger empire are examined. A documentary and time-series analysis of Germany and Austria show Germany as a non-colonizer developed into a mono-cultural empire hostile to naturalization and Austria as a European colonizer transformed itself into a multi-cultural empire that was more friendly to naturalization. Another documentary analysis of culturally similar countries shows that the Netherlands, as an early and extensive colonizer, has a much more liberal naturalization regime than Belgium, which was a late and reluctant colonizer. And the final comparative case study is of three Anglo-Saxon settler countries where the impact of differential treatment of indigenous peoples on naturalization will be examined. Throughout the case studies, the emphasis is on demonstrating the how elites made open or restrictive decisions about naturalization.<br/><br/> Third, in a pooled time-series and cross-sectional analysis, the unit of analysis is the ""yearcountry"" (i.e., 20 countries from 1970-95 with about 500 cases). This allows a year-to-year analysis of political party power, unemployment, demographic changes, and other factors that are purported to influence naturalization.<br/><br/> Zolberg's approaches to immigration) and will challenge previous economic, demographic and cultural theories of naturalization. It embeds cultural institutions within a larger political economy framework of colonization and emphasizes that theories of naturalization are clearly distinct from theories of immigration."

Recommendations will be developed for engineering education and practice. Cultural differences in coordination practices are understudied across domains of application, so our work will provide new knowledge concerning this central team process.

Biodiversity and ecosystem conservation hinge on our ability to integrate the goals of production and preservation. Although protected areas play a critical role in conservation, because of their limited geographical scope, alone they cannot meet conservation goals. Instead, conservation depends in large part on the anthropogenic landscapes in which protected areas are embedded - the matrix habitat. Intensity of human management of these zones affects the quality of the matrix which separates fragmented habitat, and the ability of wildlife to survive in matrix habitats. Due to their diversity and ecological importance, Neotropical bats are of high conservation concern; however, little information exists on their assemblage structure and ecology outside of continuous or fragmented forests. As insectivores, bats presumably bats have important ecological functions via predation on arthropods and top-down control of herbivore damage. Although it is therefore thought that bats could have a positive effect on agricultural production, little quantitative data exist from tropical ecosystems to support this assumption. This research will therefore address two main questions: (1) What is the conservation potential of differing matrix habitats for bats? and (2) What is the impact of bat populations in agroecosystems on arthropod populations and crop productivity? Research will take place in coffee plantations in Chiapas, Mexico, along a gradient of decreasing matrix quality (from traditional polycultural shade-grown coffee to monocultural low-shade systems). Mist nets, harp traps, and acoustic monitoring will be used to characterize the bat assemblage and habitat use; particular effort will be made to describe the insectivorous bat ensemble. Exclosure experiments will be used to evaluate the effects of bat predation on arthropod populations and plant productivity. This project will result in: an improved understanding of the ability of the agroecological matrix to support bat populations; characterization of under-sampled bat species in matrix habitat; and a quantitative characterization of arthropod regulation by bats in a tropical agroecosystem.<br/>The ultimate goal of this research project is to produce information that will be applied to conservation problems in the tropics, for example via improved landscape-level conservation schemes for Neotropical bats and incorporation of biodiversity conservation in agricultural planning. This research builds upon my dissertation work on the ecology of primates living in shade coffee; at the same time, it will result in a reorientation of my research program towards community ecology and applied ecological studies. Working with Sponsoring Scientist Ivette Perfecto at the University of Michigan will provide a strong foundation in agroecology and community-level studies, preparing me for future research in conservation biology. I plan to continue researching conservation issues in multiple-use landscapes. Ultimately I hope to collaborate closely with social scientists, governments, and local stakeholders to promote improved sustainability in the anthropogenic landscapes which complement the critical role of protected areas in biodiversity conservation."

To date, most research on algal biofuel has focused on identifying ""super-species"" - strains of algae that can be genetically modified and grown in environmental conditions that maximize production of combustible lipids. While it is relatively easy to grow high lipid algal monocultures in idealistic lab conditions, it has been challenging to scale-up these cultures to commercially viable scales where populations often fluctuate wildly. Monocultures also tend to be inefficient at capturing and recycling nutrient waste streams, leading to concerns about their environmental impacts and sustainability. Indeed, some have argued that single-species approaches to energy production could generate the same environmental problems that have plagued single species approaches to food production. During the green revolution, vast tracts of land were converted into high-yield crop monocultures that required intensive management and application of biocides and fertilizers to maintain productivity. While the advent of modern agriculture was a huge success for feeding people, it also became the leading cause of biodiversity loss, organic pollution, and degraded water quality worldwide. Commercial-scale 'farming' of algal monocultures to produce biofuel has potential to repeat many of the same environmentally damaging practices, and poses the same challenges to conservation.<br/><br/>Is it a possibility to find 'win-win' scenarios for biodiversity and biofuel production? Can we develop sustainable biofuels while, at the same time, avoiding unintended environmental impacts and conserving the diversity of life that is the ultimate source of all renewable resources? The interdisciplinary team of ecologists and engineers of Professors Bradley Cardinale, Phillip Savage, and Nina Lin of the University of Michigan and Todd Oakley of the University of California Santa Barbara believe this is possible. In this project awarded by the National Science Foundation through its Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation initiative, the team intends to test the hypothesis that certain naturally diverse groups of algae have complementary traits that enhance the efficiency and stability of biofuel yield beyond what any single species can achieve alone. This hypothesis stems from a wealth of ecological research that shows whenever species specialize in their use of nutrients or light, or respond to environmental fluctuations differently, diverse communities will (a) more efficiently capture available resources, (b) produce more biomass than even the single most productive species, and (c) maintain yields more stably through time. The ultimate goal of this work is to identify the most productive and sustainable multi-species algal biofuel systems, and then, on a longer term, scale these up to commercially viable biorefineries. One of the key products of the project work will be the generation of a new genomics database that will identify the genes that code for metabolic pathways involved in the production of biocrude oil. This database will not only help identify the genetic code that leads to biofuel production, it will make that code available to future researchers who wish to use genetic engineering to enhance the efficiency, productivity, and stability of algal biofuels even further.<br/><br/> The investigative team has partnered with established programs like the University of Michigan's Center for Engineering Diversity and Outreach, and the Ecological Society of America's SEEDS extension service, to aid in selecting the student personnel. Utilizing these programs will foster participation by minority groups in the sciences by connecting researchers to ethnic and economically disadvantaged minorities who are seeking research opportunities. In addition to training a new cohort of scientists, the team has also partnered with the Leslie Science & Nature Center to promote public education on sustainable algal biofuels. The Leslie Science & Nature Center is a Michigan nonprofit that provides environmental education and experiences to >25,000 visitors annually, mostly kindergarten through high-school students. A hands-on science exhibit will be developed to teach the public about the benefits of algal derived sustainable bio-oils, and ""Citizen Scientist"" summer camps will be used to show kids how to collect, identify, culture, and digest algae that are commonly used in biofuel production."

Software monocultures are widely used applications that share common vulnerabilities. Hence, any attack that exploits one instance of a vulnerable application provides the means for wide-spread damage. The emerging concept of collaborative security, wherein independent but cooperative entities form a group to improve their individual security, provides the opportunity to exploit the homogeneity of a software monoculture for collective and mutual protection. Monocultures can be leveraged to improve an application's overall security and reliability. COSS members running independent instances of the same application will continuously exchange information that allows them to collectively identify new application faults and attacks (collaborative monitoring), identify the core vulnerability shared by all instances of the application (vulnerability identification), and to automatically develop, test and apply fixes (heal the application). Identifying the application vulnerability requires potentially substantial costs in instrumentation and monitoring in each application instance. We leverage the size of a COSS to amortize the cost of monitoring the application's behavior on a per-instance basis by distributing the monitoring task across a large population; each instance only monitors a portion of the common application but collectively the entire application is covered. COSS may be viewed as a large-scale, diverse software-testing facility that allows its members to identify how a potentially large and complex host application behaves at a very fine level of granularity. This project develops, prototypes and evaluates technologies for automatically building collaborative, self-securing software systems, enabling reliable and secure commodity software."

Approaches to intensification of algal biofuel production typically focus on identifying and growing monocultures of microalgal species shown to produce high amounts of lipids. However, these monocultures, because of inherent physiological trade-offs, may not utilize nutrients and light for maximum efficiency, are susceptible to invasions by other species, and can exhibit fluctuations in biomass and lipid productivity. In contrast, microalgal polycultures can potentially circumvent these eco-physiological tradeoffs and provide a more robust platform for algal biofuels production, particularly in scalable open cultivation systems. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the proposed research is to design multispecies microalgal communities that optimize resource utilization, biomass production, and lipid accumulation under changing environmental conditions while providing increased resistance to pathogens and invasions by nuisance species. Towards this end, the diverse eco-physiological traits of many algal species will be analyzed to deduce the trade-offs among these traits, and from this analysis, the appropriate species for microalgal consortia will be identified that maximize multiple goal functions under process constraints. Mathematical models, combined with laboratory experiments for parameter estimation and model validation, will be used to assess the dynamic behavior of the designed polyculture communities, and identify those with best performance characteristics relative to their respective monocultures. The most promising microalgal communities will be further investigated for scalability using enclosed photobioreactors and open pond cultivation systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The proposed education and outreach activities will offer K-12 student and teacher experiences in bioenergy topics through the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) GK-12 Bioenergy Sustainability Project, which engages local rural schools in ecological and sustainability research.

They occur in all available soil types from desert valleys to mountain tops, across an extremely wide range of ecological settings. They are, in fact, major agricultural pests in many areas of their range, particularly in areas where the native vegetation has been replaced by monocultures of alfalfa or other crops. Over the past 20 years, James Patton has studied aspects of the genetic differentiation among populations of pocket gophers in features such as chromosomal changes and shifts in gene frequencies. These have provided clues to the processes involved in the development of the enormous degree of evolutionary divergence that is readily observable among populations of pocket gophers. The current proposal will be directed primarily to aspects of morphological change among pocket gopher populations, with particular emphasis on body size variation and its influence on various aspects of life history, such as density, litter size, number of litters per year, and so forth. The focus of the study is on comparisons between populations of pocket gophers from natural desertscrub vegetation communities in the deserts of eastern California and those that have invaded recently developed monocultures of alfalfa. Observations to date show that in as few as a dozen years or so, the average body size in alfalfa populations increases over two-fold, and that there are major shifts in reproductive performances associated with these body size changes. These reproductive changes are of such magnitude that alfalfa farmers are, in fact, also farming pocket gophers. The principal investigator will investigate the causal basis of this size variation by a series of transplant experiments, shifting animals from natural vegetation to alfalfa fields, by observing growth rates of individuals in both habitats, and by rearing young, born in the laboratory to mothers caught in both habitat types, under a common nutritional regime. By so doing, it will be determined if the body size increase is merely a reflection of the radical change in diet represented by alfalfa, or whether it represents a major change in genetical constitution due to natural selection. These studies will incorporate several different paired natural and alfalfa populations, and the relationships among the pairs will be ascertained by genetic techniques, such as protein electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis."

This project will provide a first step toward the goal of developing analytic and modeling techniques that will allow rational design of synthetic microbial communities that are robust and controllable. <br/><br/>There are theories suggesting that diversification in a microbial community may enhance stability, robustness and increase efficiency; however a precise quantitative understanding of the advantages that a consortium provides for its members is needed. This project seeks to experimentally and theoretically determine the impact of specific metabolic interactions within a microbial community on emergent properties like enhanced stress tolerance or increased biomass production. The project will use tools of dynamical systems, like invariant manifold theory and stability of invariant sets, to analyze models of microbial communities. Methods of partial differential equations will be used to extend this analysis to interacting spatially segregated communities. These models will precisely quantify the relationship between the number of defined microbial interactions and the magnitude of improvement on both consortia efficiency and enhanced tolerance. This will provide a systems biology basis for characterizing consortial behaviors and a scalable methodology to compare the benefits of membership in a microbial community to the costs for each individual. This information is fundamental to understanding microbial community persistence and will provide a rational framework for controlling both unwanted and desirable consortia. Prior research has yielded preliminary results on the conditions necessary for increased biomass production in specialized binary communities versus a monoculture and has demonstrated the existence of invariant manifolds that simplify the analysis for many types of microbial communities. This project extends this work by building experimental synthetic communities with well-defined metabolic roles, measuring the synthetic community's characteristics like biomass production and robustness to perturbations and constructing mathematical models for more complex and spatially segregated communities."

Short-term experiments will quantify the way in which the movement of individual aphids is related to population-level variance in forage quality. Longer-term experiments will relate the dynamical response of aphid populations to different kinds of variance in food quality, ranging from that characteristic of plant monocultures to that characteristic of mixed cultures of two to six different genotypes. This approach will facilitate a critical examination of the hypothesis that agricultural mixtures of plant varieties (genotypes) support lower population densities of pests than will monocultures. Finally, linking the genetic variance in plant quality to the demographics of herbivores provides a critical synthesis of ecological and evolutionary perspectives in understanding plant-herbivore dynamics."

The ultimate goal is to use this information to design optimal intercrop systems. Biomass and nitrogen yield of a corn plant surrounded by legumes may be higher than that of a corn plant surrounded by an equal density of corn plants either because of reduced competition for soil nitrogen (greater availability of soil nitrogen to the corn) and/or the transfer of atmospheric nitrogen fixed by the neighboring legume plants, i.e facilitation. These two sources can be distinquished by adding isotopic nitrogen to the soil. Reduced competition would result in an increase in the absolute quantity of labeled soil nitrogen in the intercropped relative to monoculture corn. Facilitation would result in a decrease in the proportion of labeled soil nitrogen in the intercropped corn (increase in proportion of atmospheric-derived N)."

Among the many factors that control soil fertility, two are likely to be of great importance: the number of plant life forms (trees, palms, shrubs, vines, etc.), and the frequency with which the plant community is harvested or disturbed. Replicated plantations consisting of fast-growing tropical tree species (Hyeronima, Cordia,and Cedrela), established in 1991 at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, will be used to study the controls that these two factors exert on soil fertility. In some of the plantations, the trees are grown in monoculture; these will be harvested and replanted at intervals of 1, 4, and 16 years. Other plantations contain the trees plus plants of other life forms, such as palms and banana-like herbs. Leaching is determined by characterizing the chemistry of soil water and by multiplying the concentrations of nutrients in the water by the rate of its downward movement. Downward movement will be estimated from a water-balance model that incorporates evaporation from the soil and transpiration, which is derived from energy balance measurements (solar radiation, wind speed), the ability of the plants to pass water through their leaves (stomatal conductance), and the evaporative power of the air (from temperature and humidity measurements in the tree canopies). Leaching rates are expected to diminish with increasing time intervals between rotations and with increasing diversity of plant life forms. The effectiveness with which plant communities exploit soil resource is also important to sustaining soil fertility, and it, too, is likely to vary with biotic complexity and frequency of harvest or disturbance. To assess this effectiveness, efficiencies of nutrient uptake, recovery, and us e will be obtained from measures of changes in nutrient storage and turnover in both plants and soil. Coupled with the nutrient leaching data, comparison of these efficiencies among stands will provide ecologically sound guides to tropical forest restoration and the sustainable use of tropical soils."

Attine ants cultivate monocultures of fungal clones as their major food source, whereas the fungus receives from the ants both nourishment and protection from pathogens. The proposal develops several ant-fungus systems, including leafcutter ants from the southwestern USA, to study the genetic consequences of symbiont choice exerted by the ants on their fungi. In essence, the proposed experiments ask whether cultivar diversity in ant gardens, arising through genetic mutation, may evolve under an analog of ant-driven ""artificial selection"" (symbiont choice).<br/><br/>Because symbiosis is a major recurring theme in the history of life, this research is expected to generate insights into the mechanisms that drive biological complexity and diversity.

In this project, communities of species will be selected both in vitro and in silico to produce biofilms that are stronger and more resistant to parasites, antibiotics and/or caustic chemicals. These experiments will illuminate the effects of species composition and diversity on the evolution of a successful community.<br/><br/>Natural selection not only favors fit organisms but also can act at a higher level, favoring entire populations over others, a process known as group selection. In multi-species bacterial infections, combinations of species that form stable, transmissible infections will successfully proliferate to new hosts, and will thereby be favored as an entire assemblage for further evolution. In cheese production and wastewater decontamination, dairy producers and environmental engineers artificially select among mixed communities of bacteria for those that perform these tasks best. What allows mixed communities to solve some ecological problems better that homogeneous communities? Does community-level evolution follow the same principles as individual-level evolution? Although mixed microbial communities underlie many health and environmental concerns, virtually nothing is known about their evolution. Because biofilms thrive in nature as both monocultures and mixed cultures, they offer an ideal test bed for exploring the fundamentals of community-level selection."

Thus, introduced populations may achieve greater demographic success than natives by indirectly suppressing them through pathogen-mediated apparent competition, the enemy of my enemy hypothesis. The proposed work will use an experimentally tractable system of native and introduced old-field grasses to test these hypotheses. Large-scale surveys will be used to quantify variation in ambient pathogen species richness and infection rates on native and introduced grasses in the North Carolina Piedmont.

Recently, biologists have postulated that the genetic diversity typical of natural populations may be a product of natural selection exerted by disease organisms, but few studies have tested this hypothesis. The investigators will examine the role of disease in maintaining host genetic variation by comparing resistance of closely related species in the mustard family to a rust disease. Some of these mustard species have no genetic variability, whereas other species are genetically variable. For disease to be capable of promoting genetic variation, the disease must exert strong selection on its hosts; that is, it must decrease survival and/or reproduction of the hosts, and resistance must be inherited. The goals of this study are to determine whether these conditions are met, as well as to determine whether the genetically uniform species are less resistant to disease than the genetically variable species, and whether the composition of natural vegetation is different in places with and without this disease."

In comparison, considerably less is known about marine BVOC emissions. Similar to terrestrial processes, the spatio-temporal distribution of marine BVOC emissions is thought to be highly variable, depending on the number concentration and species of photosynthetic organism. It has been suggested that marine BVOC emissions in highly productive regions of the oceans: 1) impact oxidant loadings in the marine boundary layer (MBL), 2) contribute to SOA production, and 3) alter particle size and microphysical properties, thus impacting cloud formation and persistence in the MBL. At present, there exists an extreme paucity of experimental data of BVOC fluxes to constrain global models of ocean BVOC emissions and their subsequent impact on climate and atmospheric chemistry. This multi-scale investigation is designed to link detailed laboratory investigations of isoprene and total monoterpene production from isolated monocultures of an array of relevant marine organisms with direct measurements of isoprene and total monoterpene emissions made via eddy correlation during coastal algae blooms from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) pier and during a research cruise in a region of high biological activity and high wind speeds.<br/><br/>The educational component of the effort involves coupling with the Birch Aquarium, the educational outreach center of SIO, and their Summer Learning Adventure Camp programs to: 1) Develop a hands-on experiment, for students in 7-9th grade, to investigate the uptake of carbon dioxide by the ocean and its impact on ocean acidity.

CMNs are formed by generally beneficial, root-inhabiting fungi called ""arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi"". Plants feed these fungi some of the sugar they produce by photosynthesis, and in return, the fungi take up and provide the plants with key mineral nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Once connected to a host plant's roots, the fungi forage throughout the soil and may encounter root systems of other plant species with which they additionally associate without preference, creating a network. The major question this raises is whether all plants connected to the network share mineral nutrients equitably or if mycorrhizal fungi disproportionately donate mineral nutrients to host plant species that provide them the most sugar. The researchers utilize tallgrass prairie species for their research, Big Bluestem and Canada Wild Rye. Tallgrass prairie is an endangered ecosystem in North America and prairie restorations often involve sowing the study species together. Understanding how CMNs affect interactions between these plant species might inform restoration management practices such as tillage, which can disrupt CMNs. Besides its relevance to prairie restoration, this research will engage Miami inner-city middle school students and university undergraduates from underrepresented groups. <br/>The researchers will investigate competition as mediated by CMNs between a tallgrass prairie dominant grass, Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and a less common species, Canada Wild Rye (Elymus canadensis).

Policy frameworks such as the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanisms motivate investment in African oil palm plantation expansion in the global South to 'store' carbon in these 'forests' and to produce palm oil-based biodiesel to substitute for 'fossil' fuels. This research examines the motivations and consequences of greatly intensified African oil palm cultivation in the canton of San Lorenzo in the Choc region of coastal Ecuador. There, Afro-Ecuadorian and Indigenous peoples confront the effects of extensive landscape change, as rainforest is replaced by monoculture oil palm plantations. The project's research questions investigate intersections of the following: 1) global climate change policies; 2) Ecuadorian state development plans to increase African oil palm cultivation; 3) the environmental, social and economic effects of African oil palm plantation expansion for local people; and 4), the strategies that the region's residents are mobilizing to secure their livelihoods in the face of expanded cultivation of oil palms. These research inquiries engage with political ecology literature and connect to scholarship on geographies of hope and ethnodevelopment. They are also framed by the broad climate change and alternative fuel policy literature. The methods employed include archival research, policy analysis, interviews, and in depth qualitative research in two differently impacted communities in San Lorenzo. The overall research objective is to produce and analyze original empirical data that will enable a better understanding of the following: one, how global climate change mitigation efforts, together with national-level policies, are transforming local landscapes; and two, how local communities are developing strategies to counter aspects of these ongoing changes and are generating their own geographies of hope. <br/><br/>This research project's significance lies first, in its timeliness.

This research, focused on two impacted communities, contributes to an innovative social science agenda that explores and highlights the myriad ways in which communities, groups, and individuals respond to multi-scalar economic and political processes. It takes seriously the experiences and perspectives of these historically marginalized people. By focusing on how communities potentially take control of their own lives in light of extensive palm plantation expansion, this work questions fatalistic discourse on global capital and climate change. Overall, the research will enable a rich, empirically solid contribution to deliberations over the local costs and benefits of prevailing global climate change mitigation strategies."

Although the potential impact of biological invasions on biodiversity has been recognized for decades, until recently, most research has focused on terrestrial or freshwater rather than marine habitats. Anthropogenic introductions of marine species are numerous and have had a dramatic impact in some locals. While much has been learned about introduced species over the last 15 years, generalizations relative to marine systems are elusive. This study will address the effects of introduced species on kelp bed communities in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Specifically, this research will examine the interactive effects of herbivory and competition on the introduced alga Codium fragile and the native kelp community of the northwest Atlantic, the indirect effects of a bryozoan on kelps in these communities, and the impact of increasing Codium and decreasing kelp biomass on the demography of fishes and decapods that use seaweed beds as nursery habitats. The kelp bed communities of New England shift between two alternate states: a species-rich community dominated by laminarian kelps, and a species-poor community dominated by sea urchins and crustose coralline algae. Recently, a new community consisting of a monoculture of the introduced green alga, Codium fragile tomentosoides, is now prevalent in the region. In addition the introduction of a bryozoan also appears to have severely impacted kelp bed communities. Using a series of multi-factor experiments and descriptive studies, this research will elucidate the causes of this shift in community structure, and therefore explain the mechanisms underlying the dramatic, human-induced loss of biodiversity in these kelp communities."

Little is known about how plant pathogens, which were adapted to natural mixed-plant communities in pre-agricultural times, evolved into today's highly aggressive pathogens of crops cultivated in monoculture. To fill this void, this project aims at identifying the molecular evolutionary mechanisms that allow pathogens to specialize to specific plant species and to become more aggressive. The bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (the cause of bacterial speck disease of tomato worldwide) and closely related bacteria, will be the focus of this project. A multidisciplinary approach of comparative evolutionary genomics, population genetics, and microbial genetics will be applied leveraging the latest advances in biological sciences and computer sciences. Research and education will be integrated through the development and teaching of an undergraduate course in 'Microbial Genomics and Forensics' and the creation of internship opportunities for undergraduates in the principal investigator's lab and in the biotechnology industry. It is anticipated that this project will uncover genomic changes that occurred in P. syringae pv. tomato during its evolution since the advent of agriculture and that have led to its current aggressiveness and worldwide distribution. Results from this research are expected to constitute the basis for the development of new hypotheses on the evolution of bacterial pathogens in general and to be instrumental in future breeding and engineering of disease resistant crops. Easy access to obtained results will be provided through a web-accessible database. The research in the principal investigator's lab, the undergraduate course and the collaboration with industry will not only attract students to research and provide advanced training, but also give students of underrepresented groups the opportunity to jump-start their professional careers."

Yet, our understanding of the mechanisms of competition is quit limited, in part because it does not have a strong mechanistic basis. This project proposes a novel, multi- level approach to the study of plant competition. The approach combines a new method for characterizing physiological aspects of resource competition with traditional growth analyses and demographic techniques. The system chosen for the study is competitive interactions in experimentally established field monocultures of two birch species, (Betula alleghaniensis and B. populifolia), that differ in their requirements for light, water and nutrients. Resource uptake and stand development will be monitored for two years. A third year will be devoted to processing plant and soil samples and to modeling and synthesizing data. The results will allow us to assess the magnitude and relative importance of competition for light and nutrients at various stages of stand development, and to empirically test a number of current hypotheses regarding resource competition among plants. The research will be an important step in bridging the gap between well-developed phenomenological models of plant competition and stand development, and the physiological mechanisms of competition."

Anthropogenic introductions of marine species are numerous and have had a dramatic impact in some locals. While much has been learned about introduced species over the last 15 years, generalizations relative to marine systems are elusive. This study will address the effects of introduced species on kelp bed communities in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Specifically, this research will examine the interactive effects of herbivory and competition on the introduced alga Codium fragile and the native kelp community of the northwest Atlantic, the indirect effects of a bryozoan on kelps in these communities, and the impact of increasing Codium and decreasing kelp biomass on the demography of fishes and decapods that use seaweed beds as nursery habitats.

This research will quantify decade-scale soil genesis processes by analyzing a unique on-going experiment started =50 years ago at the San Dimas Experimental Forest in Southern California. Large (5.3m x 5.3m x 2.1m deep) earthen-walled pits were filled with homogenized soil material and planted with monocultures constituting an imposed biosequence of four native plant species (chamise, ceanothus, scrub oak, and Coulter pine). A chronosequential record of the initial stages of soil formation is provided by archived samples from each 7.5 cm layer of original fill material and soil samples taken at incremental depths in 1958, 1975, and 1987 under each type of vegetation. The objective of this research is to quantify the biotic, atmospheric, and pedogenic influences on the initial homogeneous fill material as a function of time for each of the soil-vegetation systems. A mass balance approach will be used to quantify gains, losses, and redistributions of constituents in the soils developed after 12, 29, and 41 years under the four different plant species. Constituents to be analyzed include major rock-forming elements, clay, silt, pedogenic Fe oxides, exchangeable cations, C, N, and heavy metals. Calculations will be based on the archived original parent material samples corresponding to soil horizons that developed and were sampled in subsequent years. Biomass quantity and composition will be measured and included in the mass balance. Long-term measurements of atmospheric wet- and dry-fall exist for the site and will also be included. Radiogenic isotopes will be used to distinguish the origin and disposition of various soil constituents. Distinctive Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic rations in soils and tree rings will serve as tracers to indicate atmospheri c and mineral weathering sources of elements. The combination of mass balance and radiogenic isotope tracer methods will yield a detailed accounting of processes responsible for additions, losses, transfers, and transformations in the soil-vegetation systems. Precise quantification and interpretation is warranted because the San Dimas soil-vegetation plots are likely the most closely constrained and well documented soil genesis experiments in existence. They fill a critical gap between experimental studies that operate over several years and traditional soil chronosequence studies that address time scales of 102 to 106 years. Results of this research will yield a much more precise understanding of the initial stages of soil evolution than currently exists. This knowledge can be used to improve interpretations of fault movement histories from soils and to predict sources and sinks of elements, including heavy metal contaminants and plant nutrients, on a time scale commensurate with human-induced effects on atmospheric chemistry."

A model EAB, the electrode-respiring bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens is able to directly transfer electrons to electrodes, resulting in high electron transfer efficiencies. The PI has experience in electrochemical techniques that can quantify the electron transfer efficiency in EABs and compare them to the model Geobacter sulfurreducens.

While decades of microbial ecology and metazoan cellular biology have detailed many aspects of these entities, we have only recently begun to bridge models of unicellular organisms in monoculture with complex multicellular systems at the molecular level. The goal of this research is thus to develop computational methodology to model the molecular behavior of multicellular systems, particularly microbial communities and their interactions with metazoan tissues, by taking advantage of large experimental data repositories. The project focuses on characterizing the biological roles of gene products in such systems and on translating data from controlled experimental contexts so as to apply in multi-cell-type and multi-species moieties. This will require the development of data mining algorithms capable of efficiently leveraging thousands of experimental datasets from diverse organisms to model key aspects of multicellular biology: multi-species communities, cell types and lineages, and their structure and distribution within a community or tissue. For this purpose, the project will develop satellite models for machine learning in which core properties and parameters are modified on an as-needed basis. Predictions from these models will be experimentally validated by characterization of the organisms in and functional activity of the oral and gut microbiota and of individual under-characterized microbes and microbial interactions. Open-source and online implementations of developed tools will be available through the laboratory web site at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu.<br/><br/>This project will provide a general framework for genomic data mining in multicellular systems made up of multiple species or cell types, with a simple interface for summarizing thousands of genome-scale datasets.

These chemolithotrophic communities utilize energy from redox transformation of inorganic substrates, without an influx of reduced carbon or allochthonous macronutrients. For the last four years we have been characterizing the geochemistry and microbiology of Lower Kane Cave (LKC), a sulfidic carbonate cave ecosystem, as an accessible analog for deep subsurface environments. Here chemolithotrophic sulfur (S) oxidation forms the base of a complex microbial ecosystem, and these microbes appear to accelerate the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate, generating proton and potentially modifying their habitat by dissolving limestone. Our preliminary results suggest a much broader significance of terrestrial S-based microbial communities, raising new questions about subsurface ecosystems, S metabolism, the coupling of S and C cycles, and the geological consequences.<br/>Scientific Merit: Our previous work has established that a subsurface chemoautotrophic microbial population thrives in the sulfidic waters of LKC, oxidizing sulfide. Mass balance calculations show that the standard model of sulfuric acid speleogenesis (SAS), the volatilization of H2S and autoxidation on the cave wall, is insignificant, and almost all sulfide is oxidized in the aquatic system. Unanswered, however, is the question of whether the microbes accelerate sulfide oxidation and speleogenesis, directly participating in the geologic process of speleogenesis. We propose to use the natural laboratory of LKC, combined with controlled laboratory microcosm experiments, to examine the importance of microbial SAS as a mechanism of karstification. This proposal will address the following questions:<br/>1- How does the aquatic microbial community accelerate limestone weathering?<br/>2- Do the different SOB populations, with diverse S-oxidation mechanisms, influence limestone weathering to different degrees? Is community composition important?<br/>3- What is the importance of mineralogy to microbial habitat?<br/>Batch reactors and flow-through chemostat reactors will be used to examine selected monoculture and environmental mixed population community influence on calcite and dolomite dissolution rate. We will use the tools and techniques developed from our previous work at LKC to characterize the cave geochemistry, and the microbial communities in both the field system and the laboratory reactors using culture-independent methods. The rate measurements will then be combined with the detailed molecular microbiological characterization using SSU Rdna phylogenetics, RFLP, FISH and PLFA analysis to characterize the influence of community on karstification. Both the role of microbes in carbonate weathering, and the role of mineral chemistry in defining the habitat for these neutrophilic microbial populations will be examined.<br/>Broader Impacts: Sulfuric acid speleogenesis is potentially a widespread phenomenon that could be responsible for accelerated karstification and development of aquifer networks for regionally critical source of water, including the Edwards Aquifer of central Texas and its endemic stygobites and stygophiles. This project has implications for our understanding of the development of karst porosity for both aquifer and petroleum reservoirs, and our knowledge of subsurface microbial ecology. In particular this project will enhance our understanding of the role of mineralogy in microbial ecology, and allow a better understanding of the mechanisms for microbial survival and growth in the subsurface, with implications for pathogen transport in karst aquifers. This project will directly support one PhD, one MS, and one undergraduate student at the University of Texas, and introduce them to the developing field of microbial geochemistry and geomicrobiology. The LKC site has become a type locality for directly examining the theory of SAS in karstification, and the results from our previous research have been presented on PBS-NOVA, and rebroadcast by the BBC throughout Europe. The results from our work have also become a central theme in two graduate classes at UT, and the well characterized archived samples are used to teach molecular techniques to new graduate students in the geomicrobiology program"

To date, the vast majority of research has focused on terrestrial sources of BVOC, with specific attention to the factors that control the emission rates of isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. In comparison, considerably less is known about marine BVOC emissions. Similar to terrestrial processes, the spatio-temporal distribution of marine BVOC emissions is thought to be highly variable, depending on the number concentration and species of photosynthetic organism. It has been suggested that marine BVOC emissions in highly productive regions of the oceans: 1) impact oxidant loadings in the marine boundary layer (MBL), 2) contribute to SOA production, and 3) alter particle size and microphysical properties, thus impacting cloud formation and persistence in the MBL. At present, there exists an extreme paucity of experimental data of BVOC fluxes to constrain global models of ocean BVOC emissions and their subsequent impact on climate and atmospheric chemistry. This multi-scale investigation is designed to link detailed laboratory investigations of isoprene and total monoterpene production from isolated monocultures of an array of relevant marine organisms with direct measurements of isoprene and total monoterpene emissions made via eddy correlation during coastal algae blooms from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) pier and during a research cruise in a region of high biological activity and high wind speeds.<br/><br/>The educational component of the effort involves coupling with the Birch Aquarium, the educational outreach center of SIO, and their Summer Learning Adventure Camp programs to: 1) Develop a hands-on experiment, for students in 7-9th grade, to investigate the uptake of carbon dioxide by the ocean and its impact on ocean acidity.

The proposed study is an important venture to establish a robust rubric in nitrogen isotope systematic, to allow for accurate and more quantitative interpretations of nitrate isotope distributions in the environment, and thus a sound understanding of inherent nitrogen dynamics.<br/><br/>The goal of the study is to investigate the isotope dynamics of nitrogen species in the West Falmouth Wastewater Plume in Falmouth, Massachusetts, in order to resolve differences in isotope discrimination observed between studies of mono-cultures of nitrifying and of denitrifying bacterial isolates and patterns ascribed to analogous transformations in aquatic environments. For one, nitrate 18O/16O values produced by nitrifiers in cultures reveal isotope effects that are largely overlooked when interpreting environmental trends. Second, the fractionation of 18O/16O relative to 15N/14N has a characteristic and consistent slope of ~1 in cultures of denitrifiers, in contrast to a slope of ~0.6 observed for nitrate attenuation by denitrification in aquifers. The investigators seek to (1) constrain the nitrate 18O/16O values produce by nitrification in relation to environmental conditions and (2) investigate the organism-level 18O/16O versus 15N/14N enrichment imparted on nitrate during denitrification in situ as compared to culture observations. They propose to test hypotheses with a set of in-lab incubations of environmental samples from the site, as well as an in situ tracer test. The project is in collaboration with the US Geological Survey and will support a graduate student. The investigation is important because the discordance of culture to field observations raises the possibility that isotope trends in the environment are misinterpreted, possibly overlooking important fluxes in the nitrogen mass balance of aquifers."

IMTA is an innovative approach to sustainable aquaculture that involves the co-culturing of filter feeders, finfish, and macro- and microalgae in ways that exploit the benefits of interspecies interactions and internal nutrient recycling within fed aquaculture system. In conventional salmon farm monocultures, feed constitutes approximately half the cost of production, and IMTA offers a means by which waste by-products from feed may be recycled as nutrient inputs at lower trophic levels for the production of bivalves and seaweed. From an economic perspective, IMTA may be able to diversify production and increase overall production value of existing finfish farms without significant capital investment, while reducing waste production of conventional finfish farming. Preliminary research indicates that IMTA can provide a profitable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional finfish farming, with the potential to transform aquaculture in much the same way that organic farming has transformed the agriculture sector. <br/><br/>This study use economic and environmental data to develop quantitative economic evaluations of an experimental IMTA prototype, in order to assess the potential for IMTA to serve economic goals for industry profitability and resilience through horizontal integration. Using data from economic analyses, the study examines the market feasibility of incorporating IMTA into the existing salmon and shellfish aquaculture industries in Norway. The study also characterizes a range of stakeholder attitudes, regulatory policies, and environmental risks and benefits of IMTA, thereby providing quantitative and qualitative data for scientists, policymakers, industry, and the public to assess the feasibility and desirability of developing IMTA in Norway, and, by extension, IMTA in other countries."

This phenomenon has puzzled ecologists for decades. Yellow starthistle, an annual herb native to Eurasia, has invaded grasslands worldwide, but varies in invasive success. In California, yellow starthistle is one of the most devastating invaders of annual grasslands. In central Argentina, it can also create monocultures; however, in contrast to California, its dominance is short lived and requires continued disturbance. The goal of this research is to gain insight into why the same invader exhibits contrasting levels of success in different recipient communities. This objective will be addressed by replicating experiments in California, central Argentina, and in the homeland of the invader, southern Turkey. These experiments will assess the role of climate, local plant communities, and invader genotypes in this biogeographical pattern. <br/><br/>Proposed comparative activities in such a global context represent a novel approach to the study of introduced plants and have the potential to shed light on one of the most difficult problems in ecology -the mechanisms driving successful plant invasions. Our ability to ameliorate the enormous environmental and economic harms caused by invasive plants largely depends on understanding how these mechanisms work."

This research has resulted in major advances and has shown that diversity can affect ecosystem processes. However, we are currently limited in our ability to draw generalities regarding these effects that transcend ecosystems and to apply this knowledge to conservation and management efforts because: (1) most experiments are of short duration and relatively few are conducted under field conditions on natural substratum; and (2) most experiments manipulate only diversity and so cannot assess the strength of diversity relative to other known drivers of ecosystem functioning. Previous NSF-funded work found that species diversity of seaweeds does increase the accumulation of producer biomass and the diversity and richness of mobile invertebrates associated with those seaweeds. In this project, the investigator will examine the interactive effects of plant and grazer richness on seaweed productivity and assemblage recovery from disturbance by (a) continuing our ongoing diversity manipulations (b) nesting additional experiments manipulating grazers within these plots, and (c) performing new experiments to examine effects of grazer richness on algal assemblages. The main experiment consists of 72 1.5 m diameter plots in the rocky intertidal at Bodega Bay, California, split into 6 different treatments: a monoculture of each of the 4 algal species that comprise >85% of the algal cover in our system; a 4-species polyculture, and an unmanipulated control plot. The PI created these ""diversity"" plots by weeding under the auspices of a previous NSF grant. Objectives of this project are: (1) To nest within the diversity plots smaller cleared areas that either allow or prohibit access by grazers in order to test the interactive effects of algal diversity and herbivory on recovery of the algal assemblage from disturbance (or resilience). (2) To conduct a separate combined additive and replacement series experiment to examine the effects of herbivore identity and richness on algal recruitment and succession. (3) While the nested grazer-exclusion experiment is in progress, to continue weeding and collecting data in the uncleared portion of these plots as a continued test of the univariate effect of algal richness on the cover of algae and sessile invertebrates, and on mobile invertebrate abundance, richness, and diversity. Together with previous results, this will produce a 7 year record of the effects of seaweed richness on rocky intertidal communities, which will then be correlated with archived environmental data. (4) After the nested grazer exclusion experiment is complete, to cease weeding plots and track their reinvasion by weeded species in order to evaluate the mechanisms maintaining diversity of perennial algae.<br/><br/>Understanding the consequences of simultaneous changes in grazer abundance or diversity and algal diversity as well as the long-term effects of both on the resilience of algal communities in the face of disturbance will provide a better understanding of both the consequences of human encroachment into these habitats and the appropriate management efforts needed to minimize impacts and maintain ecosystem functioning. This is especially critical given that harvesting and trampling by humans are altering the diversity and composition of herbivores and algae in the California rocky intertidal zone. The PI recently briefed legislative and agency staff in California on the results of previous NSF work on the consequences of marine biodiversity, so there is interest from policymakers. The PI will continue to work with outreach groups like COMPASS and the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program to help disseminate the findings of this research as broadly as possible to the general public and decision-makers. In addition, through outreach efforts such as the Bodega Marine Lab Open House and visits to local schools the investigator will continue to foster public understanding of the importance of maintaining biodiversity and more generally of how science works. Finally, this project will develop future scientists including a technician, graduate and undergraduate researchers including those from underrepresented groups."

Tackifying polymers (adhesive-like materials) are widely used to stabilize loose soils/mulches and promote revegetation via aggregation and water retention. This project will focus on producing an eco-friendly biopolymer mixture of microbial polyamino acids and polysaccharides that has improved properties compared to conventional tackifiers, providing superior adhesion and water retention. Despite promising potential and market demand for more effective bio-based tackifiers, these microbial biopolymers have never been investigated for use in this application, as current fermentation methods for producing them are not economical. The key innovation in this project entails engineering microbial co-cultures to produce relatively expensive biopolymer precursors in-situ from beet molasses, an inexpensive and renewable feedstock, resulting in dramatic cost reductions. Beyond biopolymer production, the proposed approach of engineering co-cultures for in-situ precursor production (ISPP) is potentially transferrable to many other bioprocesses, and could offer more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other bio-based fuels and chemicals.<br/><br/>The objectives of this Phase I research project are to i) implement, experimentally characterize, and model co-culture prototypes to demonstrate technoeconomic feasibility of biopolymer production with this approach, and ii) validate the performance of these biopolymers in revegetation and erosion control applications. Completion of these objectives will demonstrate proof-of-concept, and represent important technical milestones towards commercializing this technology. The proposed approach of engineering synthetic microbial consortia represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial potential cost-savings through in-situ precursor production and process consolidation. Despite these potential benefits, synthetic microbial consortia for bioprocessing have not been explored in a commercial context due to the level of high technical risk entailed. Building on prior NSF-funded academic research in engineering consortia for cellulosic biofuel production, this project will implement microbial co- cultures capable of producing polyamino acids / polysaccharides through ISPP and perform a preliminary investigation of the interplay between ecological interactions, environmental conditions, and key performance metrics (such as titer, yield, and biopolymer composition). This project will also investigate the novel application of polyamino acids / polysaccharides as bio-tackifiers for revegetation and erosion control, enabled by the potential cost-savings of the proposed co-culture."

The fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the future. The research plan for this fellowship to David Gonthier asks if functional traits and genetic relatedness of crop diversity influence pollination, pest control, and yield in order to understand the ecological consequences of biodiversity. The research and training are being conducted at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Gttingen, Germany with sponsoring scientists Drs. Claire Kremen and Teja Tscharntke. Training goals include learning new phylogenetic and functional analyses. Undergraduates from under-represented groups are involved in field research and meta-analysis. A short term visit to Germany adds an international dimension to the research and training.<br/><br/>While increased species diversity has been shown to improve multiple ecosystem functions, few studies have investigated how functional traits and genetic relatedness of species contribute to these diversity effects and specifically in agricultural ecosystems where functions may be of economic value. For example, it may be that planting fields with distantly related plant species improves natural resistance to crop-specialist pests. Or perhaps increasing the range of seasonal flowering traits amongst plants might maximizes pollinator persistence and crop pollination. Although strawberry (Rosaceae: Fragaria x ananassa) can self-pollinate, marketable fruit yield may depend on pollinator diversity as flowers pollinated by multiple species are more-fully developed. This fellowship research is being conducted in and around the Salinas and Central Valleys of California, among the most productive regions of the U.S. for strawberry production as well as salad greens, Brassica crops, spinach, and tomatoes. In large scale California agroecosystems, strawberries are grown in monocultures in order to mechanize production and facilitate ease of harvest. However, in smaller scale systems, and in other regions, strawberries are intercropped with a wide variety of other crops. Recent research of such agroecosystems has demonstrated that intercropping with strawberries does not limit strawberry yields. Using field experiments and meta-analysis of the scientific literature, this research seeks to determine if functional traits and genetic relatedness of crop diversity impacts the focal crop pollination and limits crop-damage by pests and diseases. Finally, this project combines this information to identify potential trade-offs or synergies between pollination, pest control, and yield."

The first cases compares a massive Stalinist project to transform the Volga River basin into a unified transport, irrigation, and hydroelectric power system, with the taming of the Columbia River basin in Washington state. A second case study considers the Soviet conquest of Siberia and the so-called Angara-Enesei cascade in comparison with the development of Amazonia. The third study explores the role of scientific research in promoting brute force technology in the Norway and Soviet deep sea fishing industries. The final case study focuses on the forests of Arkhangelsk region of northwest Russia and the northern forest of New Hampshire and Maine. National politics, economics, culture, and science and engineering have had an impact on the genesis of scientific management and brute force technology. The study evaluates the impact these national features in shaping notions of scientific management of natural resources, and nature itself. It also describes the roots of the tendency to replace biological paradigms with industrial ones in which scientists treat nature as an efficient machine of monocultures, and look closely at the design of the technologies that powered the machine. In natural resource management, the driving force has been the effort to determine where production and biology meet. Cross-national comparisons will indicate what aspects of resource management are universal and what aspects reflect national determinants -- economic, political, social, ideological -- of scientific activity."

In addition, DNA sequencing will be used extensively for molecular phylogenetic studies in a wide diversity of organisms such as cladocerans, ciliates, bryophytes, and rare and endangered vascular plants of the Antilles. DNA sequencing will also be used as a tool to confirm gene constructs, site-directed mutations, and other steps involving DNA manipulation.<br/><br/>The automated genetic analyzer will play a key role in the Department's goal of establishing a doctoral program. The instrument will have a strong impact on facilitating competitive research and will enhance the quality of a molecular systematics graduate course that is being developed. In these ways, it will make a powerful contribution to the research training of the growing number of graduate students. Furthermore, by facilitating competitive research, it will improve research opportunities for undergraduates, composed 97% of Puerto Ricans, and thus increase their interest and improve their training for graduate research in the U.S. and elsewhere. The impact of the instrument will reach the whole campus, as there is currently no such instrument anywhere on campus or in the city of Mayaguez. The impact will reach beyond U.S. borders because a number of the graduate students are from Latin America and the Caribbean, and because some of the research projects operate at a regional level."

Thus, ecosystem properties of beaver ponds are not randomly distributed across the landscape nor do they change randomly through time. This research project suggests the following hypothesis: Ecosystem dynamics in valleys occupied by beaver are determined by 1) the geomorphology, hydrologic regimes, and carbon and nutrient pools antecedent to pond establishment, 2) changes in food supply in uplands as beaver forage, and 3) changes in the hydrologic regimes and nutrient cycles during pond creation and abandonment. The relative importance of each of theses factors changes during beaver population cycles, resulting in multiple successional pathways and multiple stable states across the landscape. This project will test this hypothesis at landscape and ecosystem scales by: 1) analyses of spatial patterns of ponds and adjacent riparian forests using a 65 year sequence of air photos, geographic information systems, geostatistics, and percolation theory: 2) manipulating nutrient availabilities in mixed species communities in the field and manipulating nutrients, water, and litter in monoculture mesocosms; and 3) constructing a scale- dependent model of the dynamics of boreal landscapes influenced by beaver."

Efforts to understand how eastern deciduous forests will be affected by CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere have heretofore been addressed by studying components of the forest system (individual small trees, specific processes), but it is now time to take the critical leap to measuring the integrated response of an intact forest ecosystem with a focus on stand-level mechanisms. A free-air CO2 exposure (FACE) facility being assembled on the Oak Ridge National Environmental Research Park provides a mechanism for studying stand-level responses. The facility in a closed-canopy, 11m tall sweetgum monoculture will expose trees continuously to CO2 concentrations 200 PPM above ambient. The scientific tasks are organized around an interconnected set of hypotheses that address the essential features of a forest stand and how these features could influence responses to CO2. The objectives of these tasks are to characterize aboveground tree growth and leaf area in relation to CO2 concentration and interannual variation in other environmental factors; determine physiological mechanisms of response, including foliar gas exchange, plant water relations, respiration and tissue biochemistry; quantify fine root density and turnover and other components of soil carbon cycling; quantify the critical components of the nitrogen cycle and their response to CO2 enrichment; and use a mechanistic, process-based, soil-plant ecosystem model to develop and refine hypotheses of ecosystem response to elevated CO2. The results of these analyses will be used for modeling and assessment of potential global change impacts. The Oak Ridge FACE facility will be a user facility, open to researchers from universities and other research laboratories who are interested in pursuing other questions relevant to forest response to elevated C O2."

Traditionally, scientists thought that associations between plants and AMF were non-species specific, but recent work shows that both plants and AMF species have preferences for particular partners. How these preferences affect AMF community composition in mixed plant communities remains unclear. For my dissertation, I am working in the California coastal prairies of Marin County to compare the effects of plant hosts on the composition of the AMF community. I will examine how invasive plant monocultures can alter AMF assemblages, and I will test whether certain plants in the local neighborhood can exert disproportionately large influence on the AMF community of another plant host. Additionally, my research will describe how AMF assemblages can shift as new plant species and new species combinations are added to the system. Results from this research will illustrate how invasion-mediated shifts in the plant community can alter belowground communities, since a loss of diversity aboveground may be mirrored by a loss of diversity belowground. Investigations such as the one proposed here will help us understand the broad, ecosystem-level implications of these widespread plant invasions."

The United States supported scientific research on biological warfare, radiological warfare, weather modification, and other subjects in the earth sciences in order to find ways to use science during the coming conflict. While many scholars focus on the effects on war upon the environment, this study examines the scientific research and policies designed to utilize environmental modification as a weapon. Policies about such weapons were debated at the highest levels and became a point of negotiation between allies. Although we know about the extent of this research, we know very little about its influence upon American strategy; we know even less about the relationship between environmental warfare at the national level and environmental security at the international level. International organizations, such as the UN specialized agencies, took up the question of environmental security as part of their mandates for public health, food security, and world peace. Their principal questions were the same as the ones pursued by the United States and Britain for military purposes: How do the populations of the world become vulnerable to natural phenomena, and what can be done to ameliorate the problem? The present project will analyze the reciprocal influences between national science policies and those of the wider military alliance and ultimately of the UN specialized agencies. <br/><br/>One of the intellectual merits of this project is that it explores the international development of science policy, rather than treat American decisions in isolation. It will address national security questions, to be sure, but it will draw on NATO resources and British resources to give a fuller picture of both science and strategy. It also will trace the role of transnational bodies and international agencies in formulating policies and influencing treaty negotiations such as the one banning offensive environmental modification in 1977. This project will be the first international, multi-archival study seeking to understand the influences between science policies in the national and international contexts. It will be based upon national archives in the United States and Britain, the archives of NATO, and the archives of the key UN agencies: the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization. <br/><br/>The central question of this study is this: how did the science of environmental warfare beginning in the 1940s influence international policies of environmental security by the late 1970s? It is an unexplored question, yet it is fundamental to our understanding of how cold war science has shaped the contemporary world. The answer lies at the intersection of scientific research, strategic planning, and international cooperation in the first three decades of the cold war. One of the broader impacts of this study will be a greater understanding of how American science policies shaped the development of international institutions such as the UN specialized agencies. The environmental vulnerability of developing countries motivated early American research on environmental warfare. China and India, for example, were recognized as prime targets because of their reliance on single staple crops (monoculture) to sustain their populations. This fragility, at first seen as an ecological opportunity from a warfare perspective, has also spurred a great deal of organizational activity on food security at the United Nations. The most vulnerable populations of the world were also the strategically most important peoples of the world in the geopolitical cold war struggle. By tracing the path from environmental warfare to environmental security, the present study will shed light on how the peoples of the developing world were served and/or targeted by international agencies and by national strategic planners. Thus another broad impact is that this study will encourage more research on the linkages between national science policies and global environmental politics in the developing world."

Among the many factors that control soil fertility, two are of great importance in both natural and managed ecosystems, the number of plant life forms and the frequency with which the plant community is harvested or disturbed. Replicated plantations comprising three fast-growing tropical tree species established in 1991 at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica are used to study the controls that these two factors exert on soil fertility. In some plantations, the trees are grown in monocultures, which are harvested and replanted at three different intervals. Other plantations contain the trees plus plants of two other life forms, a palm and a banana-like herb. Research for the next five years on this LTREB project will address five broad objectives: (1) determine nutrient retention, loss, and recovery following stand turnover, (2) attempt soil recuperation through nutrient replacement, (3) quantify processes that account for changes in soil fertility as a function of changes in community structure, (4) track the sequential changes in interspecific interactions and their impact on soil fertility, and (5) identify mechanisms involved in temporal changes in complementary resources use. The project will provide valuable insight on tropical forest ecology and management. In addition, the project will continue to train undergraduates and graduate students, and serve as a laboratory for courses offered by the Organization of Tropical Studies, local and international universities, and informal science visits."

The most widely cited explanation for the maintenance of tropical forest tree diversity is the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, which suggests that seed predators, herbivores and pathogens maintain diversity by preferentially attacking seeds or young trees that are close to conspecific adults. This difference in the rate of attack results in higher juvenile mortality near adults and increases the distance between successful conspecific recruits. Thus, the natural enemies of trees are proposed to prevent competitive dominance, which allows a greater diversity of tree species to persist. Despite the theoretical importance of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, few studies have looked for the predicted pattern of higher seed or seedling mortality near adults. Even less attention has been directed at understanding the predicted mechanism of natural enemies centered on the adults. This study will critically evaluate this hypothesis by asking: 1) whether damage depends on distance from adult conspecifics, 2) whether damage negatively impacts growth and survival, and 3) whether the herbivore and pathogens responsible for the majority of damage are host specialists centered on adults. Understanding the mechanisms which control diversity of tropical forests has applications to management of rain forests as well as cultivated plantations. In order not to lose diversity in managed forest reserves, policies should take into account the Janzen-Connell effects. For example, encouraging recruitment through plantings or selective cutting should consider distance to nearest conspecifics. Monocultures, such as are typically found in plantations, tend to have extremely high levels of damage from insect pests. Preliminary work suggests that one method for limiting damage would be to have mixed planting, with a minimum of 50m between any two individuals of the same species."

Defining what might be within a suite of plausible futures requires a baseline scenario that captures the factors that are most significant in shaping decisions at different levels of governance, and which highlights the current, changing and interacting sensitivities of the system to stressors associated with both climate change and economic and cultural globalization. This project will create such a baseline by assessing the drivers and evolving social outcomes of one of the world's most important food systems: the Mexican maize system. Building on prior research that anticipates climate change will have negative impacts for Mexican maize production, and the globalization of agricultural markets is further challenging the future of maize in Mexico, an interdisciplinary team of social and biophysical scientists will investigate Mexican agricultural vulnerability in terms of a complex food system, in which individual decisions to plant or not to plant maize are hypothesized to manifest as landscape scale transformations. The research team also expects that global to regional price signals and climatic variability will affect local food production and land use outcomes differently across the Mexican landscape, as a function of regionally-specific cultural, economic, demographic, ecological and political factors. The project involves: a) a description of the changing national geography of maize production and the associated socioeconomic, institutional, and demographic correlates; b) an analysis of climate trends and variability as related to maize production, yields and water availability for irrigated farming; c) an econometric analysis of the spatial patterns of maize price volatility in three maize-producing states in order to evaluate the contribution of maize price volatility to farm-level risk and d) an evaluation of the drivers (e.g., prices and climate) and outcomes (land use, perceptions of food quality, and household maize expenditures) of maize abandonment / persistence at the farm-level through case studies in the states of Sinaloa, Mexico and Chiapas. A combination of approaches will be used, including exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), econometrics analysis (spatial, time-series, and spatial panels), agro-climatic analyses, and household livelihood surveys.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary and multi-method project involves experts in economic geography, econometrics, spatial analysis, livelihood assessment, climatology, agroecology and public policy in Mexico and the United States. It will provide the foundation for subsequent research on the development of scenarios of future social-ecological change and vulnerability of food security in Mexico. The project consolidates a strong international collaborative research community, involving Arizona State University, University of California Santa Barbara, the Colegio de Mexico (Mexico City), the Colegio de la Frontera Sur (Chiapas), and the National Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIFAP, Mexico City). The project aims to enhance this network throughout the project's implementation, by inviting Mexican experts external to the project to participate in part of the annual project coordination meetings to share their research and insights. Graduate students from the U.S. institutions will collaborate with research counterparts in Mexico. The approaches and findings from the project will be used as case material for graduate and undergraduate courses in earth system science, regional analysis, development economics and sustainable food systems. The diagnostic and analytical results of this project will be disseminated through a variety of forums to maize policy experts of the national agricultural secretary (SAGARPA), state agriculture ministries in Sinaloa, State of Mexico and Chiapas, non-governmental organizations interested in land use change and maize diversity, and to the academic communities in Mexico and the U.S. The project's results will also be disseminated to Mexican authorities responsible for climate change initiatives nationally in order to contribute to the efforts of these agencies to comply with international climate change agendas."

This project investigates mechanisms at the network layer for blocking malicious traffic. <br/><br/>One such mechanism is IP filtering: access control lists (ACLs) can selectively block traffic based on fields of the IP header. This mechanism is already available in routers today but, in order to be effective, two issues must be addressed. First, one must identify which IP addresses to block, which requires understanding and detection of malicious activity. A key insight to exploit is that malicious traffic exhibits clustering in both time and address space. Second, filters (ACLs) are a scarce resource, because they are stored in the expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). To decrease the number of filters and therefore the cost, aggregation is used: a single filter blocks an entire range of IP addresses; however, this also blocks legitimate traffic originating from that range. Filter selection becomes an optimization problem that tries to block as many malicious and as few legitimate sources as possible, given a limited number of filters.<br/><br/>Outcomes of this project will include: (a) methods for modeling malicious traffic at the IP level (b) cost-efficient filtering algorithms and (c) a prototype to be tested in real networks. The problem is challenging and requires synergy between machine learning, data-mining, optimization and algorithmic techniques. The project can impact networking practice, by providing a comprehensive set of tools that can be deployed on today's Internet architecture."

When considering the potential effects of climate change, invasions of new pathogen species, or movement of disease resistance genes from genetically modified crop species to wild plant populations, understanding the role of plant disease in natural ecosystems is key. We propose a study of plant disease in the tallgrass prairie to provide information relevant to these concerns as well as to a general theoretical understanding of pathogen ecology and the role pathogens may play in determining the success of particular plant species. Plants in the tallgrass prairie of North America are of particular interest because so little area remains of this ecosystem and attempts to restore tallgrass prairie are an important focus of conservation efforts in the Great Plains. In this study we will provide information about the abundance of pathogen species and the patterns of their co-occurrence on a set of representative tallgrass prairie plant species found at the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS), an NSF LTER site in the Flint Hills tallgrass prairie region in northeastern Kansas. We will also estimate the effects of predicted climate change scenarios, landscape patterns of microclimate variation, and burning cycle patterns, and work to refine sampling methods for characterizing pathogen populations within natural plant populations.

These problems are notable for extreme complexity, being aggregated into larger scales but formed from the disaggregated choices of individuals. The very ordinariness of these daily decisions, moreover, makes them easy to overlook, so that problems in urban ecology remain under-analyzed. An exemplary case of such a problem, and an extremely serious non-point source of water pollution in its own right, is the deposition by American households of herbicidal, insecticidal, and nutrient chemicals in management of their property. These chemicals are applied to lawns in the United States at a rate per hectare that matches, and often exceeds, that of modern agriculture. Despite environmental awareness and education, such deposition continues to increase. This research examines the problem of chemical application and management using both intensive and extensive methodological components. The research will first conduct a national phone survey, using an instrument pre-tested in an earlier statewide survey, to quantitatively assess economic and demographic factors that explain variations in chemical use. This will be accompanied by an intensive interview-based municipal survey that evaluates the relationship of homeowner behaviors to environmental aesthetics, consciousness, opinions, and feelings. The research will also analyze the lawn chemical industry by focusing on their marketing practices and conduct an assessment of lawn cover nationally.<br/><br/>By creating an extensive and intensive research protocol for analysis of this urban environmental problem, the research forms the foundations of a research program in urban ecology. It pursues an explanation not only of lawn chemical practices but more generally of why individuals participate in activities with far-reaching, if invisible, environmental impact. It queries what the driving social and economic forces are behind their logics and seeks to link their behaviors to larger patterns of environmental change. The work will therefore aid in formulation of a unified human/environment research program that connects the actions of city dwellers to broader patterns of global change."
