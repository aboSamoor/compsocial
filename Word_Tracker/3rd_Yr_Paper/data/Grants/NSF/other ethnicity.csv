However, the general mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Dr. John Bunce, of the University of California, Davis, will conduct a two-year investigation of the effects of inter-ethnic interaction among individuals on cultural norms of behavior in neighboring Mestizo and indigenous Matsigenka communities along the Manu River in Amazonian Peru. This study will advance our understanding of the processes by which ethnic-typical cultural characteristics are maintained, lost, or transformed as different ethnic groups come into contact and expand interaction. <br/><br/>The actual distributions of behavioral norms and markers of ethnicity (e.g., language, dress, etc.), along with personal inter-ethnic interaction experience, will be identified and recorded in Mestizo and Matsigenka focal communities using structured interviews and extensive participant observation. The isolation of the small communities makes inter-ethnic interaction relatively limited in scope, easy to observe, and easy for people to recall. Experimental ""games"" will then be used to investigate individuals' perceptions of norms and markers in their own and the other ethnic group. Agent-based evolutionary models will be developed to gain further insight into causal mechanisms underlying the observed patterns of interaction experience and norm and marker distributions. <br/><br/>Findings from this research will contribute to social science theory of culture change that occurs as the result of intergroup contact. In addition to dissemination in scientfic venues, results also will be discussed in culturally-appropriate contexts with the focal communities and regional indigenous organizations. Understanding mechanisms of cultural change will empower them to, if they wish, design effective strategies to limit the loss of cultural characteristics that they collectively want to preserve while simultaneously engaging with outsiders. At the communities' request, the investigator teaches weekly reading and math classes while working there. Additionally, this project will expand dialogue and collaboration with Peruvian researchers through participation in seminars at Peruvian universities."

Often, they engage in language stylization practices (Coupland 2001), or the highlighted performance of a linguistic style that diverges from the unmarked style of the speaker or context. For example, a Samoan-American who typically speaks a mainstream variety of American English might employ a mock Chinese accent. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Keith Walters and Ms. Elaine Chun will examine the use of language styles as a means of constructing specifically Asian-American and Pacific Islander American youth identities at a public high school in Texas where these groups make up a sizeable minority of an ethnically diverse student body. Of particular interest is how Asian/Pacific Americans incorporate stylization practices into their varied forms of participation in mainstream activities outside the classroom context. The youths in this study, many of whom come from multiracial and immigrant families, are particularly well-positioned to engage in creative stylization practices by drawing from both in-school and out-of-school linguistic resources. While acknowledging the variability within and across the study's various Asian/Pacific American groups, the investigators are also concerned with how members of these groups come to be constructed and construct themselves as an ethnic minority in the U.S. context. Through ethnographic methods of data collection, including three semesters of full-time, daily participant observation, fieldnotes, interviews, and audio- and video-recordings, this study will illuminate the ways in which micro-level language practices relate to students' identities and their local ideologies about language, social identity, and school participation. A discourse-centered analysis of the recorded and transcribed data will tease apart the complex ideologies of race, ethnicity, nation, gender, sexuality, and class that are linked to students' symbolic practices.<br/><br/>This dissertation project will be significant for research in sociolinguistics and Asian/Pacific American studies. It contributes to linguists' understanding of how and why individual speakers move between various styles, and sometimes symbolically across ethnic boundaries, as well as how adolescents learn language ideologies that link particular styles with particular kinds of people. Asian/Pacific Americans have rarely been the focus of linguistics research. This research project will bring attention to a marginalized and particularly complex Asian/Pacific American community in a Texas military town. The project's broader social impact derives from its challenge to popular discourses in the U.S. that perpetuate stereotypical images of Asians and Pacific Islanders. In addition, the in-depth investigation of students' language practices and beliefs in the context of mainstream school activities will benefit policymakers and educators who seek to understand the various ways in which students in immigrant communities accept, negotiate, and benefit from these activities."

In response to these calls, there has been a growing literature on psychological and social variables that might predict and promote engagement in STEM-related educational and career options. Social cognitive career theory (SCCT) has proven to be a useful framework for guiding many studies of STEM engagement and retention, including research focused on women's and underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities' participation in STEM fields. The proposed project will use meta-analytic methods to integrate findings from over 45 individual studies that have tested SCCT's hypotheses in the STEM domain. The findings of this meta-analysis will (a) enhance understanding of theoretical mechanisms that underlie engagement in STEM fields; (b) enable assessment of SCCT's generalizability across gender and race/ethnicity; and (c) provide a robust empirical basis for SCCT-based interventions designed to attract and retain diverse persons within STEM careers. Participating organizations include University of Maryland (primary) and University at Albany, State University of New York (partner). The potential audience for this project includes researchers, practitioners, educators, and policy makers who are interested in broadening the participation of women and underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The project will employ a meta-analytic approach to synthesize the findings of individual studies that have been conducted over a period of 32 years (1981 to 2013). The studies to be included in the meta-analysis will be obtained through a comprehensive search of online data bases and a manual search of relevant journals. Both univariate and multivariate (structural equation modeling) statistical techniques will be used to integrate bivariate effect sizes and test SCCT models by gender and race/ethnicity in the context of STEM fields.<br/><br/>The meta-analytic findings are intended to provide STEM policy makers, educators, researchers, counselors, and other professionals with a theory-based and empirically-supported understanding of factors that promote the engagement of underrepresented people in STEM fields. This understanding can be used to inform interventions for expanding the diversity of the STEM pipeline. The project will also provide opportunities to train and mentor a diverse group of graduate students and junior faculty members (the team will include women and students of color), fostering their ability to perform theory-driven research and building capacity for future studies on equity in STEM participation. Resources created by the project (e.g., meta-analytic codebooks, a database of SCCT research in STEM fields, correlation matrices) will be made available to other researchers. The research team will disseminate the findings widely to scientific, education, and other communities through such means as conference presentations, journal publications, a project website, and development of evidence-based practice guidelines."

To the extent that influential institutional members--such as parents, educators and the media--reinforce traditional assumptions about the roles, aptitudes, and career options for men and women, subsequent behaviors in life prescribed by different roles that an individual has to perform may be experienced by that individual as incongruent or in conflict with one?s perceived gender role. Consequently, a person accepts a pattern of behaviors (or roles) by resolving or reducing the emotional and cognitive dissonance caused by role conflict.<br/><br/>The under representation of women in the IT field is frequently explained using group level analysis suggesting that the gender role expectations account for this under representation. However, a problem with this explanation is that it assumes that all females receive similar messages regarding gender role expectations, interpret role senders' messages in the same manner, and adopt similar patterns of behavior. However, while women can be seen to be a group with respect to their collective subjugation in power relations that structure society, within group variation needs to be considered with respect to how individual women respond to gender role expectations. <br/><br/>This study investigates the effect of intersecting group membership--including race, ethnicity and social class--on the types of societal messages about gender role received as well as the perception of and response to these societal messages. By investigating the intersectionality of gender, race and social class a more nuanced explanation of the underrepresentation of women in IT may be uncovered. The research examines the patterns of behavioral differences and the process of conflict resolutions through the lens of Eileen Trauth?s Individual Differences Theory of Gender and IT that was developed in prior research (NSF 0204246). This theoretical approach provides explanatory factors that help predict why some women's interest and persistence in the IT field are discouraged while others are not, even though these women may experience similar gender role expectations.<br/><br/>This project involves three phases. In Phase I the instrument is developed and administered to a cohort of both male and female university undergraduates. In Phase II the data are analyzed and preliminary results produced. In Phase III the preliminary results are taken back to the populations being studied and focus groups conducted in order to refine the interpretation of the results.<br/><br/>Broader impact: The results of this research will add to our understanding of the factors influencing IT career choice among women, thereby informing societal interventions to increase participation of females and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. Undergraduate students at participating institutions will attend focus groups in which the preliminary results will be presented. This will serve to increase student consciousness about challenges they encounter and strategies for overcoming them. The investigators bring their own identities and experiences of diversity to this research. All are women yet their different ethnicities (Euro-American, Indian-American, and African-American) have resulted in their own, different experiences of gender role stereotyping."

This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropology student from the University at Albany, SUNY, studying the relation between religious affiliation and ethnic identity in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The research will focus on two sites, the rural town of Cachoeira and the nearby capital city of Salvador, to analyze how Brazilians of African descent construct their ethnic and religious identities. Using a discourse-centered ethnographic approach as well as local surveys, the student will focus on twelve religious organizations: two Pentecostal churches, Catholic devotional associations, and Candomble centers in each place. Three hundred questionnaires will be administered to the twelve organizations and an additional 100 will be divided between local communities in the two locations. The data collected will be used to assess general demographic information, the ways in which people view and express their identities as Brazilians of African descent, and their personal opinions about cultural and racial issues of concern to the Afro-Brazilian community. The project will show how cultural tourism in Bahia, transnational movements for racial equality (of which Brazil's Movimento Negro is one expression), and international religious movements like Pentecostalism affect Brazilian's ethnic self-identity and perceptions of issues such as racism. The results should advance our understanding of Brazilian religious culture and the interaction of race, ethnicity and religious identity, as well as contribute to the training of a young social scientist and advance our knowledge of this important region of the world."

Another four million borrowers are currently more than sixty days delinquent on their mortgage and face the very real possibility that they will be next to lose their homes. Fifteen million homeowners, more than one in three with a mortgage, are at risk of walking away from their mortgage because their homes are worth less than what they owe to mortgage lenders. Foreclosures are painful not only to the homeowners who go through them, but also to surrounding communities. As houses go through foreclosure, they often fall into disrepair, surrounding property values fall, crime may increase, and the overall community can deteriorate.<br/>This project will investigate the importance of three factors that impact the borrower's decision to default on a mortgage and thus may affect the severity of the foreclosure crisis and the response of lenders and policymakers to it:<br/>1. Mortgage modification programs and strategic behavior: The extent to which mortgage modification programs induce defaults among borrowers who were unlikely to default otherwise (?strategic behavior?).<br/>2. Default contagion: The extent and the relative importance of the different channels through which a mortgage default (or foreclosure) by one homeowner affects the behavior of neighboring homeowners during the housing crisis.<br/>3. The role of recourse laws: How laws governing recourse affect the likelihood of borrower defaulting on a mortgage.<br/>To study these factors, this project will acquire and assemble a unique database that merges four data sources that have never previously been combined: (i) monthly performance data on more than thirty million privately securitized mortgages, (ii) monthly consumer credit reports for borrowers with privately securitized mortgages, (iii) deeds records identifying all mortgages and sales?and whether the borrower is an owner-occupant or investor?in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in thirty-four states, and (iv) HMDA data showing race, ethnicity, and income of almost all mortgage applicants.<br/>Using these data, this project will provide new evidence on a homeowner?s decision of whether to pay a mortgage during the housing crisis, helping economists and policy makers better understand a critical consumer financial decision with broad economic and social implications.<br/>1. Mortgage modification programs and strategic behavior<br/>This project will quantify the extent of strategic behavior generated by a recent modification program that extends benefits to borrowers who have missed at least two months of mortgage payments. The program was created in response to litigation brought by state attorneys general against Countrywide Financial Corporation during the summer of 2008. As part of a settlement announced publicly in October 2008, Countrywide agreed to implement a mortgage modification program for Countrywide-serviced, subprime mortgages throughout the United States. A centerpiece of the settlement was Countrywide's commitment to offer expedited, unsolicited loan modifications to borrowers who had missed two months of mortgage payments. The widespread scope of the Countrywide program, and its requirement that a borrower be delinquent in order to receive benefits, makes it a potentially useful experiment that could provide insight into borrower behavior in response to other modification programs using serious delinquency as eligibly requirement. Our results could also inform the debate concerning the efficiency trade-off between mortgage modification policies that extend help quickly by using simple but potentially manipulable eligibility criteria such as a delinquency requirement and mortgage modification polices that rely on more costly and rigorous screening of borrowers.<br/>2. Default contagion<br/>When a homeowner defaults on her mortgage, are his/her neighbors more likely to default on theirs? If so, what are the channels through which a homeowner?s default decision influences his/her neighbors? Do neighbors respond because they expect their own property values to fall in the near future as a result of the homeowner's default (?price effects?), or do neighbors respond because they reassess the moral, psychological, or social costs of default after seeing a fellow homeowner default (?social effects?)? Or is there a correlation in neighbors' default decisions simply because they experience common economic shocks or share a common propensity to default (?sorting effects?).<br/>This project aims to implements several different strategies to identify the relative importance of these channels. For example, one strategy examines whether the effect of a homeowner's default (or foreclosure) on neighbors' behavior depends on whether the homeowners and neighbors share the same ethnicity or race. If the effect of a homeowner's default differs between neighbors with the same race or ethnicity and neighbors with different race or ethnicity, the difference could suggest that social effects can be an important factor in explaining default decisions. This strategy potentially neutralizes price and sorting effects because it compares neighbors in the same community, but with different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Of course, it is possible that a difference in response could be due to sorting effects (like regional economic shocks) affecting racial or ethnic groups differently. To control for sorting effects, the project takes advantage of unique data on household credit to isolate so-called strategic defaults; that is, defaults by borrowers who remain current on their credit cards and student/car loans but stop making mortgage payments. Using deeds data with specific street addresses, the project can also hold constant price effects by comparing the behavior of neighbors in close geographic proximity and on the same street or cul-de-sac with neighbors on different streets or on opposite cul-de-sacs, where social connections may be less strong.<br/>3. The role of recourse laws<br/>A state recourse law determines whether a homeowner is personally liable for any mortgage balance that remains after a foreclosure sale (a balance will remain only if the home is ?underwater,? i.e., the mortgage debt exceeds the value of the home). If the homeowner can be made personally liable, the mortgage is called ?recourse.? Otherwise, it is ?non-recourse.? There is substantial inter-state and intra-state variation in recourse laws. This project hypothesizes that recourse laws are the most binding?and affect strategic default decisions?for ?underwater? homeowners who have substantial non-housing assets that could be seized in the event that the mortgage bank sues to collect the remaining balance after a foreclosure sale. Among these homeowners, those with non-recourse mortgages may exhibit higher default rates than those with recourse mortgages. This project will assess whether recourse laws affect default decisions and, if they do, identify the characteristics of borrowers who are responsive to these laws and assess whether these homeowners represent a significant proportion of homeowners with a mortgage."

The country has experienced four coups in the past two decades in which ethnicity has intersected with socio-economic and political issues.<br/><br/>In this pilot research, the investigators will observe and conduct studies in four schools, urban and rural indigenous Fijian schools and urban and rural Indo-Fijian schools, spending three months at each site. They will focus on the presentation of ethnicity in the schools and outside of them. They will employ a multi-faceted methodology that includes the use of interviews, structured surveys, participant observation in segregated schools, and life histories. The twelve month project will be divided into four equal time blocks in three regions: Suva (the ethnically balanced southeastern capital city), Ba (a northwestern and predominantly Indo-Fijian sugar town) and the Sigatoka Valley (a southwestern agricultural region with numerous indigenous Fijian village schools). <br/><br/>The research is important because it will illuminate scientifically the political and social processes by which colonial ethnic inequalities persist in contemporary societies. Post-colonial ethnic conflict is a widespread problem. Fiji provides a useful arena in which to develop a generalizable theory about how and why this is so.

The objective of this project is to investigate the conditions under which ethnic groupings seek empowerment by incorporating themselves, by deploying their sovereign legal status for economic ends, and by copyrighting their cultural practices, knowledge, designs, performances as intellectual property.<br/><br/>In order to achieve this objective, the project undertakes a broad, comparative documentary study of manifestations of the phenomenon, glossed as ""Ethnicity, Inc."", in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Africa, and conducts two in-depth, exemplary case studies in South Africa, where the phenomenon is growing very rapidly. The methods used combine detailed archival analysis of selected cases from across the world (using largely unpublished materials) with ethnographic fieldwork (based on participant-observation and extensive interviewing). <br/><br/>The primary questions this project seeks to answer: Under what conditions do ethnic groups legally incorporate themselves and become businesses? By what means and mechanisms, legal and other, do they go about doing so? Is there any discernable relationship between resort to ethnic business and the presence or absence of ethnic violence? What is the effect of the commodification of cultural products and practices on the lives of those who ?own? them, on the exercise of authority over them, and, more generally, on ethnic group membership? In short, who benefits, who loses? The projected importance of the study lies in its effort to contribute to the establishment of an interdisciplinary field dedicated to the critical study of new developments in the political economy of culture and identity."

A strong ethnic identity and non-alignment with the majority ""white"" group has been commonly taken to account for the presence of distinct features, as well as the absence of regional dialect features, in the speech of minority groups. This dissertation research aims to further our understanding of the social and linguistic factors that determine an ethnic group's choice of variables by investigating how the speech of white ethnics (Polish Americans) who grew up in a majority minority setting (New York City) reflects their complex identities.<br/><br/>With the goal of unpacking speakers' complex identities, such as ""Polish"", ""white"" and ""New Yorker"", this research analyzes the co-occurrence of potential substrate effects from Polish and regional features of New York City English in the speech of individual speakers. On the linguistic level, this research investigates whether the presence of one substrate effect entails the presence of another, and whether the presence of one substrate effect can block the adoption of a regional feature. On the social level, through a self-reported Polish orientation survey, this research explores whether a strong Polish cultural orientation and frequent use of Polish are good predictors of the occurrence and rates of substrate effects. Social and linguistic data will be collected through sociolinguistic interviews with first and second generation bilingual Polish Americans. Additional data will come from reading tasks, a Polish cultural orientation survey, and ethnographic observations.<br/><br/>This research will be of interest to educators and parents of bilingual children whose foreign accents may cause them stigmatization in schools, the workforce, and the legal system due to negative language attitudes. A deeper understanding of how a speaker's first language (L1) can influence the second language (L2) could help educators and caregivers to distinguish ethnic features from learning disabilities.

Although scholars have noted the importance of food environments in shaping food choices and health outcomes, research to date tends to compartmentalize place-level factors and ignore the relational qualities of place. The presumably less healthy food habits of low-income and minority populations are typically explained by lower access to affordable and healthy food. However, food practices, ethnicity and place are mutually constituted through a web of social, political, economic and emotional relations within homes and communities. These connections between food, ethnicity and place remain poorly theorized and need to be more systematically substantiated through empirical and comparative analysis. In particular, there is limited research on the ways that family dynamics and children influence these relationships. The project addresses this knowledge gap by investigating everyday family food practices associated with the acquisition, preparation and consumption of food, intra-household negotiations of these practices and responses to diverse and changing local food environments in several neighborhoods in San Diego representing predominantly Italian, East African and Mexican communities. Particular attention is given to the enabling/constraining capacities of place in shaping social reproduction and children's agency in influencing family practices, resisting gendered divisions of labor, and creating new bridges between home and other environments. Quantitative and qualitative approaches are integrated to collect and analyze data. In each site, the research team will conduct food audits, map food resources and census data, and interview store and restaurant owners, school and public officials, and leaders of community-based organizations to generate a better understanding of the local food environment. This will inform extensive ethnographic research centered on children and their families to collect data on everyday food practices and the dynamic relationships between food, place, and ethnic identities. Data will be collected through food-related activities in schools, participant observation, focus groups and subsequent family interviews of children and parents/guardians both separately and together.<br/><br/>This project will be the basis of a new community-based research and service-learning curriculum for undergraduates and will provide training for graduate students. The research team will work closely with local organizations in identifying needs and resources, developing solutions, and disseminating findings. This project will also advance the literature on food practices by situating them in place-specific social relations. Doing so, it will contribute to research on environmental context of food consumption by considering the relational qualities of place, their embeddedness in social relations, and the ways these spatialized relations produce unique food environments and influence food choices. It will expand and further connect literatures on children and social reproduction by bringing children firmly into the negotiated process of social reproduction through our ethnographic work. In addition, the research will contribute knowledge on race by generating better understandings of the spatiality of 'ethnic' food practices and the social construction and materiality of race. <br/><br/>This project is cofunded by the Geography and Spatial Sciences and Cultural Anthropology Programs."

Using five comprehensive, large-scale and longitudinal datasets, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin will examine differences between subgroups in intended as well as actual STEM attainment and investigate how patterns of academic achievement and social inclusion contribute to those differences. Three of the five datasets are nationally representative samples while the other two were collected in Texas and include large sample populations of Hispanic students. Separately the five datasets provide the opportunity to examine certain unique measures of academic achievement and social inclusion; collectively they provide the chance to investigate STEM trajectories at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender from the 6th grade to the end of college. Special attention will be paid to the experiences of minority girls/women and minority boys/men to gain a more comprehensive and comparative picture of contemporary patterns of inequality.<br/><br/>The analysis focuses on two research aims: 1) to examine how academic achievement and social inclusion contribute to differences in intended STEM attainment during middle and high school by gender and racial/ethnic subgroup; and 2) to examine how academic achievement and social inclusion contribute to differences in actual STEM attainment during college by gender and racial/ethnic subgroup. Statistical analyses include models using logistic and multinomial logistic regression and multi-level models to examine school or classroom level effects. Intended STEM attainment is measured using the answers to various survey questions about desired occupation and comparing the relative preferences with non-STEM occupations. Academic achievement is measured using grades, test scores and course-taking. Social inclusion is measured using answers to questions about perceived peer and teacher support and perceived equitable treatment. The framework of the study is grounded in theories of intersectionality that focus on the intersection of gender and race/ethnicity and the multiple jeopardy that may apply when one is a member of two different groups with relatively lower status. This analysis uses large-scale data to explicitly address the experiences of different groups and to uncover patterns that may affirm this jeopardy or identify instances of resiliency when students succeed in educational environments.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the project is to broaden STEM participation by contributing new knowledge about the factors that promote or impede the retention and attainment of women and minority youth in STEM fields. Findings will be presented at academic and policy-related conferences, published in top-tier peer-reviewed journals in education and sociology, and distributed through press releases to local and national media outlets to reach a broad public audience. The research team will also use their extant relationships with national teacher professional development programs to communicate research findings to key audiences of primary and secondary teachers across the country. Additionally, the project is working to broaden participation through the recruitment and training of women and minority doctoral students in the fields of STEM education and sociology. The diverse perspectives of these students, coupled with the rigorous analytical training they will receive, are critical for preparing future generations of academic researchers to study STEM equality."

For this cycle, the organizing theme ""Minority Group Demography"" of the program focuses on impacts of immigration on the geography and social and economic conditions of U.S. racial and ethnic populations. Students have much to study and research about these impacts, as immigration is reshaping many U.S. racial/ethnic minority communities. This interdisciplinary focus reflects the expertise of the two new principal investigators: Nestor Rodriguez (Department of Sociology) and Rebecca Torres (Department of Geography and the Environment). It is expected that the students who are accepted into the program will continue to be a diverse group including under-represented minorities.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The intellectual merit of this REU Site at UT Austin is the academic and ethical development of junior social science scholars around a topic of immense importance to the United States. The goals are to provide the REU students with exposure, experience, and expertise. Precise program objectives have been developed to accomplish these goals. Exposure to social demography and geographic analysis is accomplished via formal coursework and seminars. In addition to the research projects, a series of professionalization workshops, or pro-seminars, are conducted during the summer. In these pro-seminars, the REU students discuss issues such as getting into graduate school and the myriad ethical concerns that social scientists confront during research. The REU students gain concrete experience in three ways. First, students learn about substantive issues concerning the social and spatial dimensions of impacts of immigration on racial and ethnic settings in the formal course. Second, students are introduced to statistical analysis of migration data in a programming lab and to spatial data analysis in Geography workshops. Third, students experience intense mentoring from Population Research Center (PRC) graduate students and faculty affiliates as they work to produce a stand-alone deliverable scholarly paper by the end of the summer program. Finally, the REU students demonstrate their expertise in two ways. They present their research work to a gathering of faculty affiliates, graduate students, and other invited scholars, and with travel support they will present their REU research papers at the annual fall meeting of the Southern Demographic Association (SDA).<br/><br/>Broader impacts. The main broader impact of the program is to influence the future of higher education in the social sciences, with special attention to the racial/ethnic and gender diversity of the future academic workforce. The successes of the previous REU site program at UT Austin are already evident, including students who have recently earned their Ph.D.s and have been placed at leading research universities, a host of students who are in leading graduate programs around the country, and others who have recently completed the REU program and will be moving on to graduate school."

Within this framework, racial or ethnic identity is viewed as a process whereby identity is negotiated both through external forces and more social psychological factors. A complex set of factors influence the construction of ethnic or racial identities and how groups choose to call on shared history and culture. Because of the complexity of the racial/ethnic identification process, I rely on multiple methodologies including historical analysis of archival resources, census data analysis, and in-depth interviews to help garner a more thorough understanding of the racial identification of Mexican Americans. I examine historical documents pertaining to the 1930 Census and the development of the Mexican racial classification, as well as Mexican American lobbying efforts against this racialized identity in favor of political recognition as ""White."" I then explore contemporary Mexican American identity as reflected in current racial self-reporting on the U.S. Census and in the reporting patterns for children in households with Mexican-Anglo intermarriages. Finally, I conduct sixty in-depth interviews with a strategic sample of Mexican Americans in five Texas cities, investigating how such factors as socioeconomic status, racial composition of neighborhood, proximity to the US-Mexico border, social networks, nativity/migration history, Spanish language fluency, physical appearance, and political attitudes affect their own racial and ethnic identifications and their labeling choices for their children. This project contributes to scholarship on Latino identity, as well as addresses broader issues of the importance of multiple variables in the development and salience of racial and ethnic identities not only in the US Census, but in the broader US society."

Currently, the Office of Management and Budget's Directive 15 governs the collection not only of census data but of all federal data concerning race and ethnicity. Over the last several years that directive has come under increasing scrutiny. Some argue that new categories, such as a `multiracial` category, ought to be added; others propose changing the names of certain categories; and some suggest scrapping the entire racial/ethnic classification scheme. The considerable research under way focuses on empirical questions, such as how various groups understand and use the descriptors. However, the relevance of this research for proposed revisions requires an understanding also of the ethical, conceptual, and methodological issues underlying racial and ethnic classification. This project will analyze these issues and consider their significance for competing schemes. One set of issues concerns ethical and policy choices, such as whether the harms of past classification schemes are best redressed by preserving, refining, or eliminating them. Answering this question requires an examination of the significance of racial and ethnic identity and of the legitimacy of the purposes served by racial classification. Demographic research needs raise another set of problems, including the requirement of comparability between past classification schemes and future ones, the issue of measurement effects -- how and to what extent different classification schemes may affect what is measured, and the role and significance of self reports in data collection. The research is a collaboration between philosophers, a lawyer-social psychologist, and a demographer. Each will lead a different aspect of the research, which will employ the methods of moral philosophy, philosophy of science, legal analysis and demography. Among the products of the research will be a memorandum submitted to OMB, a series of papers to be published in appropriate journals including public policy journals, and an anthology."

This doctoral dissertation research studies whether the Nigerian local government could influence religious and ethnic conflict by ensuring adequate political representation of religious, ethnic, and gendered interest groups. The co-PI will spend approximately one year months in Kaduna researching equity and peace-building measures of local government areas (LGAs) that can be salient for conflict-reduction and democracy-building. The hypotheses are 1) local government positions, such as legislative, executive, and supervisory roles, that are more ethnically and religiously representative of the LGA population will have less ethnic and religious conflict; and 2) LGAs that are more responsive to rising ethnic and religious tension and have stronger ties to ethnic, religious, and gender organizations will have less ethnic and religious conflict. Data will be collected using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies to complete an analysis of relations of power across spatial scales. The co-PI will conduct interviews of a cross-sectional sampling of individuals of voting age, a purposive content analysis of Nigerian newspaper coverage of religious conflict, archival research on LGA structures and budgets, direct observation of LGA meetings, and focus groups and interviews with elected officials; community organizations of ethnic, religious, and gender affiliations; youth groups and the principal political parties. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The study integrates methodologies from sociology, political science, gender studies, and peace and conflict resolution. The integrative approach will contribute to the understanding better of the functions of the State and local authorities in reducing conflict and building for stability at the intersection of the cleavages of ethnicity, class, gender, and religion in contemporary Nigeria. Research findings will contribute to sociological scholarship on religion, ethnicity, and politics where scholars have called for developing stronger models. This project seeks to advance measures of innovative local government equity- and peace-building in Nigeria and, indeed, the wider sub-Saharan African region."

Since the annexation, thousands of Crimeans critical of the region's new Russian authorities - particularly ethnic Ukrainians and indigenous Crimean Tatars - have voluntarily resettled in mainland Ukraine. As these groups lay down new roots, many have begun referring to themselves as a ""diaspora."" Their use of this term is striking, as a diaspora typically implies migration across international borders and a common ethnic identity, while displaced Crimeans are ethnically diverse and remain within their country of citizenship. With the question of diaspora in mind, this project examines how displaced Crimeans in mainland Ukraine are renegotiating ethnic, national, and regional identities in the face of new geopolitical realities. The knowledge generated from this research project will make a valuable contribution to understandings of the contemporary conflict between Ukraine and Russia, with important implications for policymakers and social scientists. <br/><br/>This research project will rely on ethnographic field methods - including interviews and participant observations - to directly engage with and give voice to communities of displaced Crimeans in mainland Ukraine. Using the concept of diaspora to frame experiences of identity (re)construction among displaced Crimeans serves to problematize the prevailing theoretical assumption that migrant populations are not diasporic without a common ethnic identity and the experience of displacement from one nation-state to another. This view excludes groups that migrate within the borders of a nation-state, despite the fact that differences of race, ethnicity, language, and culture may vary as much among populations within nation-states as they do between them. This project contributes significantly to a more critical understanding of diasporas that overcomes the ""territorial trap,"" or the over-reliance upon spatialities of the nation-state to frame, interrogate, or explain social phenomena. This project will have important implications for the study of diasporas and socio-spatial identities more generally across the social science, with particularly salient applications for the study of identity in Ukraine and throughout the post-Soviet space."

The rapid growth of ethnically angled campaigns in the 21st Century demands a consideration of the role of Latino ethnicity both among Latinos and non-Latinos. Two questions in particular, are addressed. First, how do Latinos1 respond to co-ethnic candidates? Second, how do non-Latinos respond to Latino candidates? This dissertation argues that individual levels of ethnic in-group identification and ethnic cues condition the likelihood of ethnicity exerting an independent effect on vote choice for Latinos; affecting the likelihood that ethnicity ""trumps"" partisanship. For non-Latinos, the focus is on the perception of non-Latinos toward Latino (ethnic out-group) candidates. What type of ethnic cue triggers a rejection of the ethnic out-group candidate, even if that candidate has one's same partisanship? As out-group members, how do non-Latinos react to Latino ethnic contexts, or put more simply, ""how much"" ethnicity is a non-Latino comfortable with?<br/><br/>This dissertation utilizes a cognitive-affective model of the role of social groups in political thinking to understand the mechanism linking shared group attitudes/orientations to vote choice. A multi-method approach is employed in this dissertation. However, given the nature of the question and data limitations, the primary methodology is experimentation. An experimental design allows for the testing of the role of different Latino ethnic contexts on vote choice for both Latinos and non-Latinos.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project is the understanding that will be gained of Latino political behavior. Latinos are now the largest minority group in the country and their growth rates are projected to continue unabated (Census 2000). Today, any discussion of American politics requires a well-informed treatment of Latinos."

They are testing a model of ethnic immigrant incorporation into the labor market. The methods include event history analysis over time to analyze survival or mortality of the businesses over time. The study is novel in several ways. First, the data is unique, consisting of the comprehensive list of applicants for a General Business License in the city of Chicago. Second, the theoretical model of ethnic entrepreneurial development is novel in arguing that the interaction between ethnic group characteristics and the opportunity structure produces two distinct patterns of entrepreneurial development that are associated with the two modes of labor market incorporation of immigrant groups: replacement labor and replacement entrepreneurs. The two patterns of immigrant incorporation and business development are associated with the type of migration, social background, and organizing capacity of the group, differences that will affect business survival, profitability, and success."

This literature stresses the fact that the United states remains a multicultural, pluralistic society and cites as evidence the social, cultural, and economic differences that exist and persist among ethnic groups. The purpose of this project is to develop a theoretical and empirical analysis of why and how these ethnic differences in skills and earnings persist across generations. The operational hypothesis of the study is that ethnicity acts as an externality in the human capital accumulation process. The simplest version of this hypothesis states that the skills of the next generation depend not only parental inputs, but also on the average quality of the ethnic environment in which these investments are made. The introduction of ethnic capital into an economic model of intergenerational mobility has an important, fundamental implication: ethnic differences and skills and earning observed in this generation are likely to persist for many generations and these difference may not be amenable to easy eradication. This hypothesis will be tested using a number of data sets, including the General Social Surveys, the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, and Public Use Samples of the U.S. Census."

Entrepreneurship plays an important role in stimulating economic development and growth, and research to-date indicates that entrepreneurship could provide ethnic minorities with a springboard for economic progress as well as further social and political advancement in the cities they inhabit. The proliferation of small businesses can also help neighborhood revitalization in some low income, ethnic communities. However, the rate of business start-up and survival differs by race/ethnicity, gender, foreign-born status, and place. Through a comparative framework this project seeks to analyze the spatial patterns of ethnic minority-owned-enterprises (EMEs) at multiple scales and examines how spatial embeddedness influences their formation and performance. Using a geographic perspective that links place, ethnicity, gender, and entrepreneurship, two research questions will be addressed in this project: (1) How are EMEs socially and spatially embedded in different places? (2) What is the role of place in the performance and development of EMEs? Facilitated by the use of a micro-level census dataset, the spatial pattern and performances of EMEs will be analyzed using advanced spatial analytical techniques and multilevel regression across all metropolitan areas in the U.S. Detailed analyses at the local scale will be conducted in a selection of different immigration gateways. ""Vertical"" (one ethnic group across multiple places) and ""horizontal"" (multiple groups within one place) comparisons will be made to permit a high degree of flexibility when comparing and representing different types of US metropolitan areas by simultaneously considering socioeconomic forces at both local and macro levels. <br/><br/>This project will promote an understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing ethnic minorities and women in their economic integration through entrepreneurship. This is important, especially given the current national push for economic recovery, to the ethnic minority labor force, economic development practitioners, the immigrant support community, and urban policy makers.

The irregularities and violence surrounding Kenya's recent election demonstrates the danger of presuming quiescence when a nascent democracy holds an election. These issues have heightened tension between the parties and within the electorate. <br/><br/>Undertaking an exit poll for the Ghanaian election will increase knowledge of the determinants of the African vote. Conventional wisdom is that Africans vote largely upon ethnic lines. We argue that this picture is very far from complete. Recent exit poll results in Kenya demonstrates that African voters are quite similar to those in the industrial democracies -- they use many sources of information to inform their vote, ethnicity being only one. Many voters did rely on ethnicity to inform their vote, but many did not. In fact, a surprising number of Kenyans chose their candidate on the basis of government performance. Most seem to use the information of ethnicity and performance to make their choices. Surprisingly, studies of Africa's democracies and electorate use very little systematic data in their exploration of the continent's voters. And yet, the US government -- as well as other countries -- spends millions of dollars promoting democracy in Africa, and yet knowledge of the motivations of African voters remains murky, and is generally drawn from anecdote, a small number of cases, or surveys that are not part of the actual electoral process. Few scholars to this point have employed the most powerful tool to measure voter intention and checks against fraud: the exit poll. <br/><br/>Ghana is considered on its way to being a stable democracy, so understanding the motivations of its voters opens the way to a deeper understanding of African politics. The events and issues that surround the election can inform us as to how citizens vote.

Most observers of African elections view the process as a mere ethnic headcount: all citizens vote for their own ethnic group regardless of the performance of the incumbent government and without reference to the issues of the day. Yet there is scant evidence to support this view. In the vast majority of African countries a single ethnic group cannot achieve a majority of the votes. Ethnic coalitions break down and shift frequently and politicians from the same ethnic group are members of different political parties. The salience of ethnicity to politics in African countries varies widely and elections produce violence in some cases but not others. Moreover, our knowledge of the motivations of African voters remains murky, based primarily upon anecdotal reports, studies of a small number of (unscientifically selected) cases, or surveys that measure attitudes but not actual electoral behavior.

Gibson and James D. Long<br/><br/>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: How do Voters Decide? Ethnicity and Performance in African Elections<br/><br/>0718782<br/><br/>Abstract<br/>On what bases do African citizens choose leaders in democratic elections? African elections are typically understood as highly ethnic, where candidates appeal to voters by inciting ethnic fear or using selective incentives such as patronage to attract support from co-ethnics. The study advances our understanding of African voting behavior by identifying when, where and in what ways ethnicity and performance matter, either separately or in conjunction. Consequently, this will demonstrate whether politicians pursue policies, goods, and services directed at their own ethnic group or more broadly to the district or nation. If ethnic hypotheses are correct, co-ethnics will be returned to office time and again and narrowly target policies towards their group. If performance hypotheses are correct, poor performers will be thrown out of office and politicians will be encouraged to pursue policies targeted towards co-ethnics and non-ethnics alike.<br/>In order to understand whether and how ethnicity and performance matter to voting, this study proposes a post-election survey of Kenya's upcoming December 2007 election. It will consist of randomly chosen voters from precincts in a nationally representative sample. The survey will ask questions regarding ethnicity, evaluations of performance, and vote choice for candidates in local and national elections. <br/>The study makes empirical and methodological improvements upon current studies by using novel individual level survey data. Rather than postulate the effects of ethnicity or performance at the group level, the survey allows for robust and direct tests of these variables in determining an individual's vote. Performing the study for local and national elections allows for separate tests using different electoral units that vary over a number of characteristics. It provides a better measure of performance than extant studies, understood as the delivery of local public services that result from taxation. Through randomization, the survey also avoids problems of selection bias that plague other studies. Such data will allow me to test separate hypotheses concerning the independent effects of ethnicity and performance, as well as the ways in which the two interact. <br/>The broader impact of this project has important implications for development in multi-ethnic and poor countries. The results of this study can provide politicians, policymakers and donors with critical information regarding the relationship between citizens and leaders over issues of ethnicity, performance, public services, and taxation. If performance theories are correct, elections are the prime mechanism that induces accountability on the part of politicians. These policies may in turn become the engine to sustained economic growth and development. If ethnic theories are correct, we might expect skewed policy biases that are harmful for progress over the long-run. This is especially true at the local level, where scholars and policymakers increasingly view local government as the potential catalyst for development."

According to research on ethnic economies, ethnic solidarity can facilitate entrepreneurship by helping business owners cut costs and expedite the search for goods, services, and employees. Many researchers of ethnic economies have overlooked the role of religion in business and assumed that ethnic solidarity is the most significant determinant of beneficial network ties. Meanwhile it is likely that religion also plays an influential role in the ethnic economy. Religious texts include discussions of business ethics, and religious institutions facilitate solidarity through worship services, group meetings, and social events. Research also suggests that some religious tenets correlate with entrepreneurial success. With this study, the co-investigator will place religion at center stage in the research of ethnic economies by answering the following questions: How does religion influence ethnic entrepreneurship? How does religious identity shape network formation in the immigrant economy? When immigrants have crosscutting religious and ethnic ties, what types of networks are they drawn to? For example, do Iraqi Muslims tend to develop networks with other Muslims regardless of country of origin, or with other Iraqis regardless of religion? The investigator will conduct 120 interviews with Iraqi, Palestinian, and Lebanese entrepreneurs of Muslim and Christian faiths, who own businesses in Metropolitan Detroit. Semi-structured interviews will be used to collect data on each business owner?s network members and on the role of religion and ethnicity in the life of the business owner. <br/><br/>This research has the potential to reform theories of ethnic economies by demonstrating the important role of religion in network formation. Religious diversity and the saliency of religion are increasing, which makes these findings on the influence of religion in business valuable to future studies both in the U.S. and abroad. Finally, this research is significant not only because it focuses on Arab Americans, an underrepresented group, but also because it highlights the rich ethnic and religious diversity within a group that is commonly presented as monolithic."

Fish<br/>University of Wisconsin-Madiso<br/><br/>U.S. school data has revealed extreme racial and ethnic inequality in exceptionalities, with students of color up to three times more likely to be identified with disabilities as their white peers, and white students up to three times more likely to be identified as gifted as their peers of color. Presumably, parents and teachers intend to support students' academic and social outcomes when they intervene by referring students to be tested for exceptionalities. How do these benevolent micro-level interactions connect to macro-level racial and ethnic inequalities? Existing research explains racial and ethnic disproportionality in special and gifted education by arguing either 1) that schools make biased decisions or 2) that co-factors, such as poverty, explain racial and ethnic differences. This literature is limited by its treatment of exceptionality as a natural category. This research treats exceptionality as a social construction, and the meaning of this construct changes with there are with a student's race and ethnicity. The major research question is how do schools shape this construction of exceptionalities based on race and ethnicity? To address this question, the research uses a mixed-methods approach to 1) examine school-level variation in the effects of students' race and ethnicity on teachers' decisions to refer students to special education through an experimental audit design; and 2) identify the mechanisms creating the construction of exceptionality through observations and interviews with teachers and parents. The central hypothesis of the study is that under sufficient racial and ethnic diversity, exceptionalities are constructed in ways that reproduce racial and ethnic inequalities. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This project has clear implications for policy and practice, as scholars, policy-makers, and practitioners have demonstrated the need for further understanding of the causes of disproportionality in special education and gifted services.

Advances in communication and transportation allow immigrants to maintain ties in both their country of origin and in the countries where they settle. The great concentration of people from diverse racial, ethnic and national backgrounds characteristic of urban centers like New York City promotes the formation of inter-ethnic group networks and inter-ethnic unions. An increasing number of people report being of mixed-racial or mixed-ethnic ancestry in population surveys like the census. Taken together, these factors suggest that more people can lay claim to multiple ethnic identities. <br/>This dissertation project by a cultural anthropologist will examine how Latinos in Queens, NY negotiate between multiple ethnic identities in everyday contexts. The research builds on the proposition that an increasing number of people regularly switch from ethnicity to ethnicity in normal discourse, in an attempt to maximize their economic and political interests. Close observations of participants' verbal interactions, interviews, discourse analysis, social network assessment questionnaires, and household surveys will be used to determine the contexts under with ethnic identity switching occurs and how switching is done. <br/>While ethnic identity has long been understood by anthropologists to be a contextual phenomenon, less is known about how the process of ethnic identity switching works. The broader significance of the project, in addition to contributing to the education of a doctoral student, includes its contribution to an understanding of how people choose among ethnic identities in day-to-day contexts. The research will specifically examine language use among Spanish-bilinguals as an ethnic identity marker. The findings will have practical applications for policy makers interested in refining current methods for collecting and categorizing data on ethnic identification; and educators interested in incorporating a bilingual approach in their classrooms."

As relatively new immigrant groups, Koreans and Vietnamese are of particular interest in understanding the process of ethnic self-identity and ethnic formation. The major aim of the full project is to develop theoretical models of the dynamic, multidimensional, and contradictory adaptation processes of the ""new second generation,"" and to bring gender to the study of ethnicity and ethnic formation. The general research questions include (l) What are the dynamic adaptation process of adult children of Korean and Vietnamese immigrants? (2) What are their subjective experiences of managing different cultural worlds, including different gender expectations? (3) How must current theorizing be modified to capture the adaptation experiences of second generation Korean and Vietnamese Americans? (4) What kind of ethnic identities are emerging and how do they vary by gender? (5) How do adaptation processes affect family power dynamics, solidarity and conflicts in immigrant families? This study will rely on data from surveys and individual and focus group interviews. There are five goals of the research planning portion of this project. 1) Collect individual and focus group interview data to develop closed ended survey questions and interview guides. 2) Pretest the sampling techniques. 3) Pretest the survey. 4) Analyze pretest data and use findings to revise survey and interview guides. 5) Further develop the theoretical and conceptual framework. This research will contribute to social scientific understanding of immigration and cultural assimilation, a topic of great current interest for both scientists and policy makers.

St. Augustine, located in Florida, is one of the oldest European settlements in the New World. It was founded by the Spanish but also occupied by Minorcans as well as other ethnic groups. Because of its age and cultural complexity, the site has been extensively excavated. Its importance rests not only on the amount of archaeological material which has been recovered but also on the detailed archival records which contain information on individual families. Mr. Cusick will focus his attention on a sample of nine households of both Spanish and of Minorcan origin. Not only is archival information available for all but the living sites of each have been carefully excavated. Mr. Cusick will integrate the documentary evidence with information derived from analysis of material objects, floral, and faunal remains. He will examine how the economic and social strategies of these families changed over time and how these shifts are related to ethnic, economic, and status factors. The goal of this project is to examine the role which ethnicity plays in shaping household adaptation strategies. Minorcans were a minority group in St. Augustine, and with joint archaeological and archival data it will be possible to determine how such groups reacted, in comparison with the dominant Spanish majority, to changing economic and political conditions. One major theoretical question debated in the sociological literature concerns the extent to which response follows ethnic lines. Some argue it is more closely correlated with cross cutting economic distinctions. This research is important for several reasons. First, it provides a unique insight into mechanisms for ethnic adaptation and assimilation and, thus, is directly relevant to social issues faced by the United States today. Secondly, it will assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist."

This is a particularly important finding in Africa, where countries are ethnically diverse, democracy is new and weak, and voters lack access to important information about candidates, parties, and democracy. This study will open a new research agenda in ethnic politics: the study of ethnic distance. Numerous studies have found that voters in Africa are most likely to vote for candidates from their own ethnic group, their ""co-ethnics"". However, these studies fail to explain how ethnicity influences the voting behavior of those who do not have a co-ethnic candidate in the race. By some estimates, on average, 40% of the African population will face presidential elections in which they do not have a co-ethnic candidate for whom to vote. Thus, because of the focus on co-ethnicity, our understanding of how ethnicity influences the political behavior of this 40% is extremely limited. This project seeks to explain the role of ethnicity in determining the voting preferences of those without a co-ethnic candidate. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project introduces the concept of ""ethnic proximity"", and measures it through a survey conducted in Liberia. It investigates the possibility that ethnic similarity is a more robust predictor of voter behavior. This is important because it implies that multiethnic coalitions, which are widely believed to benefit democracy (because they reduce civil conflict), are most likely to form and be sustained in societies with sufficiently similar ethnic groups. Diversity may not be the key factor that prohibits building multiethnic coalitions, but it could be the degree of difference among the various ethnic groups that is of greatest consequence. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: If ethnic distance matters for coalition building, and ethnic identities are changeable, then it can also be used in US nation-building efforts. While Liberia is important for US security interests in its own right, as strengthening democracy in Liberia will likely bring greater stability to the region, understanding how ethnicity promotes or hinders the formation of multi-ethnic political coalitions in Liberia can provide a basis to understand how it would work in other areas of the world. The United States has invested substantial amounts of money in Liberia's post-civil war reconstruction over the past 10 years. This study's results could provide insight into the effective use of resources: while money spent developing infrastructure and democratic institutions is necessary, devoting some resources to reconciliation, in the form of public campaigns to highlight ethnic similarities across groups in an unbiased manner rather than blanketed national identity appeals, may enhance the functioning of democratic institutions. More broadly, the US and its allies have struggled to address the ethnic divisions that plague countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. These ethnic rivalries have often proven spoilers in efforts to promote democracy in these nations. The findings of this study will be instructive for those critical cases as well."

Developmental researchers have provided evidence that there are growth spurts in these behaviors across childhood and adolescence. However, existing models of prosocial development have been guided mostly by theories that emphasize the role of social cognitions and/or emotions on prosocial and moral behaviors. For the most part, the role of culture and ethnicity on prosocial development has been less clear in these theories, even though there is clear evidence of cultural and ethnic differences in prosocial development. Although both social cognitions and emotions are significant correlates of prosocial behaviors, new theories of prosocial development are needed that integrate the role of culture and ethnicity in prosocial development. Unfortunately, the bulk of the research investigating the developmental mechanisms that lead to prosocial development has been conducted with white, mostly middle class, children. Thus, our understanding of the development and predictors of prosocial behaviors in ethnic minority children is quite limited. To begin to address these issues, research is needed on the development of prosocial behaviors in ethnic minority children and adolescents. This project is designed to examine parenting, sociocognitive, and culture-related correlates of prosocial behaviors across childhood and early adolescence in one ethnic minority group (i.e., Mexican Americans). The two-phased systematic research agenda will combine qualitative and quantitative approaches. The overarching goal of the project is to gain an understanding of positive, social behaviors in Mexican American and European American children in the United States. The project is designed primarily (a) to examine ethnic group similarities and differences with respect to prosocial traits and behaviors in Mexican American and European American children and (b) to investigate the parenting, familial, and sociocognitive correlates of prosocial behaviors in Mexican American and European American children. When completed, the research will answer a number of questions that social and developmental psychologists have advanced in recent years. These questions include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Is normal development of the abilities to understand another's point of view, to feel sorrow or concern for needy others, and to make moral decisions when faced with a context in which there are societially defined right and wrong behaviors associated with high levels of prosocial behaviors in both Mexican- and European-American children? (2) Do both Mexican- and European-American children who exhibit high levels of prosocial behaviors have parents who are warm and supportive and use explanatory and empathy-inducing disciplining practices? (3) Do Mexican American parents, compared to European American parents, emphasize collectivism (i.e., orientation towards greater social group) and familial interdependence, which in turn accounts for ethnic group differences in prosocial behaviors? (4) Do family and parenting processes impact or explain the relations of the abilities to understand another's point of view, to feel sorrow or concern for needy others, and to make moral decisions to prosocial behaviors in Mexican- and European-American children? (5) Do the adaptations that Mexican American children make to the mainstream and ethnic cultures as a result of the processes of acculturation and enculturation impact prosocial development. By addressing these questions, this study is expected to yield important information about variables that might promote prosocial behaviors and produce useful and valuable new measures of prosocial behaviors to use with Mexican American children and adolescents. These products will inform existing theories of prosocial development and will enhance intervention programs aimed at increasing behaviors that benefit others and society."

Kentucky This project examines (sub-national) regional economic and political change in a society undergoing a shift from a command to market oriented economy, the southern Rhodope region in Bulgaria. This shift and its associated decentralization, demonopolization, and liberalization have brought to the subject region, like many peripheral regions in Central and Eastern Europe, withdrawal of industrial investment, decline in agriculture, and increasing social polarization. In the Rhodope, the social change has most negatively affected the large Turkish-speaking minority. The research project is focused on three forms of transition: (1) the democratization of local and national state power, new civil institutions, and the emergence of ethnic politics focused on the Turkish-speaking population; (2) decentralization of control over industry, regional restructuring of production, branch-plant closure, and mass unemployment; and (3) privatization of tobacco production and the effects of continued monopoly power in tobacco marketing. The three research questions are: (1) How have the economic changes affected support for ethnically based political parties and actors since 1989? (2) How has the rise of the Turkish-dominated political party affected the nature of regional economic change? (3) What roles do gender and ethnicity play in these changes, within households, manufacturing plants, and local politics? Working with Robert Begg of Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Mueke Meurs of The American University (via subcontracts) and colleagues in the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the University of Sofia, the PI will interview political and institutional leaders, industrial managers, and households, and will make use of secondary statistical data. The research results should have relevance for our increasing recognition of the causal linkages among economic, political, and social-identity (gender, ethnicity) change in local settings. The results s hould have relevance to other peripheral regions in rapidly changing counties of Central and Eastern Europe. The research itself will add to the English-language writing and expertise on this world region."

Specific factors to be evaluated include the influence of the defendant's language of testimony, defendant's ethnicity, and jurors' ethnicity and language dominance on judicial processing of criminal defendants. The research will fill a void in our understanding of several issues. First, little is known about the disposition of cases involving Hispanic defendants. The national Hispanic population (10.95%) is growing so rapidly that it is projected to surpass the black non-Hispanic population (12.14%) within the next 6 years (U.S. Bureau of Census, 1996). Second, in multilingual environments, trials are conducted with courtroom interpretation of testimony with increasing frequency. As the monolingual Spanish-speaking population has increased, Spanish-English interpretation is critical to the processing of many Hispanic defendants. Almost no data are available to evaluate the impact of interpreted testimony on trial outcomes where juries have deliberated. Third, the project focuses on the influence of interpretation on jurors' decision-making in a context in which the population is predominantly Hispanic and where many jurors are themselves bilingual. To study these variables, an experiment high in mundane realism is being conducted. Six versions of a burglary trial are shown to participants via videotape. Three thousand jury-eligible community residents will serve as mock jurors. After seeing and hearing the evidence, jurors deliberate to decide if the defendant is guilty or not. If they find him guilty, they will make a recommendation for a sentence. The data will be analyzed at the jury and juror levels, using multivariate statistical techniques that will enable the researcher to assess the attributions jurors have of the defendant and the case disposition patterns. The results will contribute to a better understanding of how Hispanic defendants are treated in the criminal justice system, the influence of courtroom interpretation, and the effects of jurors' language dominance on their decision--making and jury verdicts. They will also inform policy makers about the bilingual courtroom."

To address this important problem, the study has four objectives. These include (1) investigating the effects of respondent race/ethnicity and culture on respondent verbal and nonverbal behaviors as indicators of response processing difficulties in survey interviews, (2) the effects of race/ethnicity on survey response styles, (3) the degree to which the effects of race/ethnicity on cognitive processing is moderated by question design features such as topic and format, and (4) the degree to which race/ethnicity effects can be accounted for by individual differences in cultural value orientations. Questions from major NSF-funded surveys, including the General Social Survey, the National Election Survey, and other major national social surveys, will be used to examine these objectives. Survey interviews will be conducted in the Chicago metropolitan area with a total sample of 800 adults from four distinct cultural groups: African Americans, Korean Americans, Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites. Interviews will be conducted in English, Korean, and Spanish. Interviews will be audio and video recorded and subsequently behavior coded to identify verbal and nonverbal markers of cognitive processing difficulties, including problems with question comprehension, memory retrieval, response mapping, and socially desirable responding. The response latencies associated with each answer also will be electronically recorded. Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to analyze these data and address each study objective.<br/><br/>As the U.S. ethnic and racial structure continues to diversify, understanding how this demographic transition may complicate the interpretation of survey results will become an increasing priority. This research will contribute to the understanding of the mental process respondents engage in as they answer survey questions. The study also will provide crucial insight into racial/ethnic differences in these processes. It will offer insights about the nature of racial/ ethnic variability in question comprehension across a variety of common types of survey questions, as well as racial/ethnic variability in response styles. It will address the role of race/ethnicity through the lens of cultural values, unpacking known racial/ethnic differences in extreme response style, acquiescence, socially desirable responding, and other such differences by linking them to cultural value orientations. The study also may lead to recommendations regarding best practices for the design of survey questions that minimize cultural differences in comprehension and response styles.

The past few decades have witnessed tremendous changes in the politics of race, ethnicity, and gender in the U.S., not the least of which is the simultaneous growth in the numbers of women and of racial and ethnic minorities in public office. This study examines the complex and conditional processes by which these female and/or minority lawmakers succeed or fail to enhance the substantive policy interests of women, women of color, and racial/ethnic minorities. It explores not only the ways in which the representation of race, the representation of ethnicity, and the representation of gender are both similar and different; but also the ways in which efforts to represent the policy interests of women and of various racial and ethnic minorities are linked. Thus, the primary questions motivating this research are: how might the representation of women and of racial and ethnic minorities be linked and how might those linkages be affected by the political and institutional contexts in which they do or do not take place?<br/><br/>To address these questions, this study takes a very close and extensive look at the policymaking activities of state legislators - male and female, of all races and ethnicities, across multiple states, and over multiple decades. First, it examines the legislation proposed and sponsored by Black female and Latina state legislators (in comparison to their colleagues' proposals) to shed light on how lawmakers who may identify with multiple groups, and see themselves as representing multiple group interests, participate in the agenda-setting stages of the policy making process. Next, it explores the formation of legislative coalitions across gender, racial, and ethnic lines by examining and explaining patterns in the co-sponsorship of bills. Finally, this study investigates how state policy outcomes are affected by the presence and activities of women and minority legislators. Of special concern is whether the fates of gender and race-related policies are linked by the efforts of women of color or by coalitions of women and/or racial-ethnic minorities within these lawmaking bodies.<br/><br/>To conduct this research on representation and the politics of race, ethnicity, and gender in the American states, the Principal Investigators created three inter-related databases: one on individual state legislators and their districts, one on bills introduced by those legislators, and one on the political, socioeconomic, and institutional characteristics of each state and state legislature. To construct these databases, information was gathered from 25 states, at four-year intervals starting with 1981 and continuing up to 2005. Collectively, these states are representative of all fifty states on several important dimensions including: proportions of women, African Americans, and Latinos in the state legislature; party control (Democrat or Republican); ideological climate (liberal, moderate, or conservative); and electoral competition. The availability of these databases to the wider scholarly community should spur a great deal more research on race, ethnicity, gender, and political representation as they are manifest throughout the policy making process, within and across various historical and institutional contexts."

This research will examine household pre-impact preparedness and post-impact restoration activities in South Florida following Hurricane Andrew. The central focus will be an examination of the ethnic differences in household response to warning and subsequent preparations as well as specific restorative activities undertaken following impact. Household preparation activities refer to potential loss of life and damage to property. Household restoration activities include those actions undertaken by households to deal with the emergency situation following impact and short-term actions undertaken to restore some semblance of normal household function. The multi-ethnic nature of South Florida will allow for a more complete examination and assessment of ethnic variation in these activities. This research will combine a field survey of approximately 300 households located in heavily impacted areas and telephone surveys of approximately 1000 households serviced by Miami media markets and in the hurricane warning zone to assess ethnic variations in preparedness and restoration activities. While the literature has often alluded to ethnic variations in disaster activities, the nature of these variations has yet to be fully research. Social science literature is replete with discussions of the importance of race and ethnicity for employment, income, education, socioeconomic status, housing quality and ownership, access to political power, family organization and structure, and the like. All of these factors play critical roles in preparedness and restoration activities. In addtion, there are often language and other cultural differences among ethnic populations, such as those of South Florida. From both a theoretical and applied perspective, it is important to understand the role of ethnicity in disaster response and management."

The ""dynamics of Circumpolar Land Use and Ethnicity"" (CLUE) project is a combination of research and education in partnership with northern indigenous peoples of Russia that will investigate the relationship between resources and ethnicity of indigenous circumpolar societies confronting RCC, as well as their agency on the global stage to secure land and resource rights. Because Fennoscandia and Alaska have in some respects developed the discourse of indigenous rights more fully than Russia, the bulk of the fieldwork will be done in Russia with materials from Fennoscandia and Alaska serving as comparisons. <br/><br/>Starting with the premise that when nation states define which indigenous groups can access land resources and the usage such access entails, a circular dynamic is formed whereby categories of people (and even historically well-defined groups) aspire to be ""recognized"" according to these state legal criteria. The CLUE project will explore the ways in which climate change adds additional pressure to this state defined system of land access and use. One example of such pressure is that as RCC increases the growing season and the agricultural line pushes northward it intersects with indigenous reindeer pastures, affecting local peoples' herds, which are already under stress from winter temperature fluctuations. These intersections, catalyzed by RCC, create new disputes not only about land use but also about the definition of ""indigenous"" itself. <br/><br/>In addition to an investigation of how RCC and the discourse of RCC affects indigenous resources and resource use, CLUE researchers will investigate the concept of ""indigenous people,"" their rights according to international covenants, and the different meanings of the concept in different national settings. Finally, the CLUE project team hopes to explore other arenas of ethnic discourse such as environmentalism, often with global roots and funding, and resource extraction in the north as well. <br/><br/>CLUE has been sponsored as a full proposal by the IPY Joint Committee and is endorsed by the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON).

The primordialist view would suggest that people join ethnically based political parties largely for psychological reasons while, for instrumentalists, the decision to join turns on how efficiently the organization appears to pursue its economic or political objectives. Employing a mailed questionnaire, this doctoral dissertation research project tests hypotheses issuing from the theory of social identity, a theory that promises to provide a superior grasp of ethnicity's primordial aspect and its relationship to ethnically based political participation in Germany, Britain and France. If the hypotheses are borne out, this research will offer empirical evidence in favor of the primordialist perspective, suggesting that instrumentalists might have to revise their accounts of the rise and decline of ethnically based political parties and of ethnic group behavior in general. The research will indicate the value of the theory of social identity for explaining why people join ethnically based political parties."

It focuses on how local demographic features like ethnic divisions and civic participation in public life jointly shape the incentives of politicians to target particular communities for public works projects. Original survey research and interview data will examine the extent to which these social features lead politicians to privilege the interests of certain groups over others, as well as how politicians manage the fund in ways that are consistent with their political goals. In so doing, this study contributes to the growth of generalizable knowledge about the efficacy of democratic governance in the developing world, where governments struggle to deliver basic services to their citizens.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Recent work on ethnicity and public goods has helped clarify the mechanisms by which ethnic diversity negatively impacts levels of public goods provision. However, this research too often focuses on diversity itself rather than examining the political salience of ethnic divisions. This focus tends to examine ethnicity in a vacuum, isolated from the political institutions and social contexts in which actual distributive decisions take place. By critically examining how ethnic identity interacts with these contextual features, the present study will offer a more complete picture of distributive politics in developing-world democracies. In addition, by systematically comparing constituencies with varying levels of civic participation, the study facilitates a test of theories suggesting that widespread civic engagement can induce greater public accountability from legislators.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This research speaks directly to matters of practical concern about the performance of new democracies in Africa. Understanding how ethnic identity and the behavior of civil society impact public goods provision is essential for ensuring representative governance and promoting equitable development. The information will be useful to policymakers eager to expand access to public goods provision to broader segments of the population.

The PI seeks to expand this model to specifically address the unique contributions of social identity factors in STEM engagement. This study will follow the students via self-reports across 3 years to gather insight into continuity and change over time. Participants will be adolescent 10th, 11th and 12th graders, who are a mixture of white, black, Latino and Asian Americans. Parents or primary guardians of the adolescents will be included in the study. The initial sample of 256 students (32 per gender x ethnic group) was extended to include 100 additional students and parents. The participants will be a representative sample of public high school students and their families in the school district of Philadelphia PA.<br/><br/>The research will examine possible conflicts between gender and ethnic stereotypes. One example is a perceived conflict between the math competency associated with Asians and the negative gender stereotype associated with an Asian female. The primary research questions are: 1) How do gender and ethnicity interact in academic identification and STEM achievement behaviors; 2) Which factors put female and ethnic minority students at risk for not pursuing STEM; and 3) Are these constructs and processes stable from 10th to 12th grade. The quantitative analyses will focus on regression analysis; however, structured equation modeling (SEM) may also be utilized. <br/><br/>The proposed study will provide new knowledge and understanding to the fields of educational, social, and developmental psychology, STEM education, and education policy through the development of a stronger conceptualization of the social/cognitive factors responsible for the participation of girls and ethnic minorities in STEM. The project will provide data absent in earlier studies on attitudes of students of color as well as a point of departure for education researchers and policymakers, whose goal is to develop effective motivational strategies to increase the participation of female students of color in STEM education and careers.

Based upon recently completed, large area probability studies of multiple race and ethnic groups in the continental United States, the proposed telephone surveys of 5,000 Asian, Caribbean, African, non-Hispanic white and Latino American groups will be the first, to our knowledge, nationally representative, explicitly comparative, simultaneous study of all these groups. Using the same constructs, with measures empirically validated to work satisfactorily across these samples, will provide opportunities for the first comparative, empirical analysis of how race and ethnicity influence the political attitudes, behaviors and activism levels across a broad array of groups. <br/><br/>The data will permit scholars to explore within and between group differences, thereby increasing our knowledge about how identity, consciousness, ideological beliefs, socio-demographic, and social and economic status factors, influence or structure the political lives of people that differ in ethnic and racial background, immigration and citizenship status, and geographic dispersion; advancing the understanding of the ways in which important aspects of group, self, and social development related to political behavior in adulthood.<br/><br/>The existence of these datasets on national samples of diverse American ethnic and racial populations will provide unprecedented opportunities for hypothesis development and testing of empirical relationships. Because the 2004 data collection will be disseminated (ICPSR and the Web) in 2005 and the panel datasets released in 2009, the data will be available very quickly to the larger social science fields, especially political science. <br/><br/>This will provide unprecedented opportunities for seasoned and new investigators to test a variety of hypotheses about the relative influence that group and individually based resources have on the political lives of racial and ethnic groups, but rarely tested because of the absence of appropriate, comparative, high quality data. As we have learned from the earliest NBES and Black and Hispanic Politics studies of the 80s and 90s, these data will also be of benefit in the high school, undergraduate and graduate classrooms, and for other educational purposes (workshops, text books, etc.). In addition, the research and training activities accompanying the development of the NBES and related studies had positive influences in the development and training of a large number of academic political scientists now holding prestigious and important positions in the field.<br/><br/>This proposed study has the potential of surpassing the accomplishments of these earlier studies because: 1) of its larger scope; 2) it builds on the work of the last two decades; and, 3) the presence of a wider array of interested political scientists across the country that are well-versed in sophisticated survey research methods and quantitative data analyses. When completed, this new study will have important implications for understanding the nature of racial and ethnic minority policy concerns, policy and candidate preferences, party attachments, and methods of increasing political participation, including a wide variety of activities, such as voting, in the American democratic process."

Census data from the 1910, 1940, 1950, 1970, and 1980 censuses will be used, with a focus on English, Italian, Polish, and Jewish women. Census data from 137 different American cities will be examined through time to see how features of the local economy and population composition affect the labor force participation of women in the chosen ethnic groups. Previous research has viewed the ethnic identification of immigrants as gradually receding as a result of prolonged exposure to the American melting pot. More recently researchers have recognized that ethnic identification and distinctive forms of behavior associated with that identification can be either strengthened or weakened, depending upon features of the local social structure in which members of a group live. Yet to date few studies have rigorously investigated how this ""emergent ethnicity"" works, and by doing so, this project will make an important contribution.

The project is significant because it will move the field forward in providing a more meaningful, comprehensive, and nuanced understanding of to what degree, how, and why race, ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice are interrelated. Importantly, the intellectual merit of the project will be in expanding our current understanding of the meaning of race and ethnicity in crime and criminal justice, while also embedding knowledge of the observed linkages within the context of the broader positioning (racial/ethnic structure) of groups in society. Two types of activities geared are planned to achieve the specific objectives identified above. First, the PIs will hold a series of workshops and related meetings. The first of these will be held in conjunction with the 2005 annual meeting of the American Society of Criminology in Toronto, Canada. The second will be held during June or July 2006 in Columbus, Ohio. During these meetings, agenda setting activities, including identifying gaps in research beyond those generated in previous workshops and discussing additional outlets for disseminating and setting the agenda items in the context of existing knowledge will be undertaken. The workshops and meetings will also serve as vehicles for identifying topics and funding sources for collaborative research projects to address major neglected issues in the study of race, ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice. Small groups will then work on developing the design and seeking funding for the projects with feedback from the larger study group. Our second mechanism for expanding understanding of the race/ethnicity-crime/criminal justice link is through holding a summer research and professional development institute for young scholars from underrepresented groups. At the institute, each participant will complete a research project with guided training and mentoring in a ""safe"" and resource enriched environment. At the culmination of the institute, there will be a mini-conference where participants present their work to the broader set of scholars involved in this project. This will provide an additional mechanism for institute participants to gain feedback and develop relationships (network) with other senior and junior scholars in the field. The summer institute will take place in Columbus, Ohio during the summer of 2006.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This project is structured to have several specific broader impacts on scholarship and the academy. First, it will signal to the larger research community the types of research issues, theoretical frameworks, and methodological strategies that are required to improve knowledge in an important area. Second, it will draw on the expertise of scholars who are diverse along a number of dimensions (e.g., race and ethnicity, disciplinary training, and stage of career) to develop significant innovative research projects that take into account the complexity of race/ethnicity and embed analysis in the differential positioning of groups in society. Third, it will broaden participation in crime and justice research by fostering the careers of scholars from underrepresented groups. Together these will have a more general impact in bringing diverse and innovative perspectives to bear on research and curricula, thereby yielding new insights on the role of race and ethnicity in outcomes like crime and criminal justice decisions into the future."

These scholars (the Racial Democracy, Crime and Justice Network, RDCJN) established a Summer Research Institute (SRI) and annual summer workshops as vehicles for pursuing these goals. The group has achieved a number of important successes. The SRI has graduated 22 young scholars who are publishing and gaining tenure. The RDCJN has also published two volumes: The Many Colors of Crime: Inequalities of Race, Ethnicity, and Crime in America and ""Race, Crime, and Justice: Contexts and Complexities"" (Volume 623, May of The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science). The goals of this project are to build on these successes. We seek to: (1) continue to advance the research and professional development of young scholars from underrepresented groups for carrying out innovative research, and thereby foster democratic inclusion in academe; and (2) undertake additional collaborative projects that will provide a more complete understanding of the interrelationships among race/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice. These two goals are closely interrelated.

To facilitate achieving project objects, the PIs will hold additional SRIs for underrepresented faculty to enhance their research achievements and success in academe. The institutes will be structured to provide a ""safe"" and resource-rich environment that supports, trains, and mentors young faculty in the completion of a paper/proposal for journal publication or grant review, and offers a tool-kit of information for survival in the university. In the long run, these activities should contribute to a critical mass of scholars-of-color whose work is visibly placed, and whose presence and success encourages students-of-color to pursue research and teaching careers. Second, they will hold summer additional workshops to develop collaborative projects oriented to improving the quality of research on crime and justice. The workshops will be structured to: provide a setting for reporting on and improving on-going research; draw on the diverse perspectives of scholars from different disciplines, race/ethnic backgrounds, and stages of career in developing research; and support the broadening participation activities of the SRI, especially by integrating underrepresented faculty into a larger network of scholars. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This project will have two important broader impacts. First, it will broaden participation in the field by fostering the careers of scholars from underrepresented groups. The workshops and SRIs will bring diversity in perspectives and participation to research and curricula within criminology and criminal justice. Second, it will draw on the expertise of diverse scholars to carry out innovative crime and justice research. The central premise of this work will take into account the complexity of race/ethnicity and embed analyses in the differential positioning of groups in society. Through collaborative, multi-method, and comparative studies, the researchers will produce a body of original multidisciplinary work that emphasizes the variable significance of race for crime/criminal justice, and how racialization relates to the understanding of citizenship and democracy, nationally and around the world."

The PI seeks to expand this model to specifically address the unique contributions of social identity factors in STEM engagement. This study will follow the students via self-reports across 3 years to gather insight into continuity and change over time. Participants will be adolescent 10th, 11th and 12th graders, who are a mixture of white, black, Latino and Asian Americans. Parents or primary guardians of the adolescents will be included in the study. The initial sample of 256 students (32 per gender x ethnic group) was extended to include 100 additional students and parents. The participants will be a representative sample of public high school students and their families in the school district of Philadelphia PA.<br/><br/>The research will examine possible conflicts between gender and ethnic stereotypes. One example is a perceived conflict between the math competency associated with Asians and the negative gender stereotype associated with an Asian female. The primary research questions are: 1) How do gender and ethnicity interact in academic identification and STEM achievement behaviors; 2) Which factors put female and ethnic minority students at risk for not pursuing STEM; and 3) Are these constructs and processes stable from 10th to 12th grade. The quantitative analyses will focus on regression analysis; however, structured equation modeling (SEM) may also be utilized. <br/><br/>The proposed study will provide new knowledge and understanding to the fields of educational, social, and developmental psychology, STEM education, and education policy through the development of a stronger conceptualization of the social/cognitive factors responsible for the participation of girls and ethnic minorities in STEM. The project will provide data absent in earlier studies on attitudes of students of color as well as a point of departure for education researchers and policymakers, whose goal is to develop effective motivational strategies to increase the participation of female students of color in STEM education and careers. Further the knowledge to be gained from this research is central to the development of curricular programs designed to target such groups, i.e., programs that respond to the specific educational <br/>disseminated among parents and the community as well as scientists and educators.

Complexities of ethnic identity in the region of former Yugoslavia are almost always associated with the brutal conflict that occurred in the 1990s. Dominant political discourses on ethnicity in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in particular, are marked with attempts to naturalize opposition between different ethnicities, as well as legitimize violence and creation of ethnically homogeneous areas. Ethnosectarian ideology permeates all structures and institutions of Bosnian society, from political and educational institutions to religious and cultural ones; most of all, it heavily structures the everyday life of people in Bosnia. As such, this project seeks to study the mundane practices of what has been called the ""geopolitics of everyday life""; specifically, this research examines not only what particular people are doing in particular places in their daily life, but also the much under-studied issue of what they feel and what emotions they are experiencing in these settings. The research is a primarily qualitative investigation of daily life, based on deployment of multiple methods such as participant observation, walk-alongs, interviews and space-time-emotion diary. The site of the study is a town of Mostar, located in southwestern BiH. It is a historic setting, the contemporary socio-spatial landscape of which is the product of war atrocities, competing nationalist ideologies, and a volatile political climate created under the administrative ethnic partitioning of post-Dayton BiH, during which the town was segregated into a ""Bosniak/Muslim"" east and a ""Croat/Catholic"" west.<br/>The dissertation advances our knowledge of the relationships between emotions, affect, and geopolitics; for, among several criticisms of affect's non-representational theories is the claim that it has not been used to understand problems of real social and political importance. In addition, this research deploys, in the study of the affective and emotional dimensions of the built environment, an innovative methodology developed in psychology; in particular the project uses an established projective technique that enables the assessment of emotions and affect during participants' daily activities. In this way, this research advances methodologies of affect and emotion in geography. More broadly, the insights gained from this study will contribute to our understanding of the current challenges of multiculturalism throughout Europe. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

Ethnic categorization in Louisiana has undergone a number of changes historically, and this research will present a new perspective on this ongoing process. The communities to be studied are located on land that is threatened by coastal erosion that is proceeding so rapidly, particularly with the recent increased intensity of hurricanes, that they may be permanently evacuated within the next ten years. This study may therefore be the last opportunity to document the language before the communities disappear. <br/><br/>Interviews with native French speakers of both Native American and White (Cajun) descent will be digitally recorded and videotaped. In order to test the claim that residents can identify a speaker's ethnic and/or regional origin, Ms. Dajko will play segments of pre-recorded speech and ask informants to identify the ethnic and geographic origin of the speakers of the passages presented. Quantitative analysis using multivariate statistics will allow the researcher to establish relationships between linguistic variation and ethnicity, and informants' ascription to others of ethnic affiliation, sex, and geographic origin. In addition to filling in the gaps in our understanding of the linguistic situation in the Lafourche basin, the study will provide further insight into the relationship between Louisiana French and ethnicity, and contribute to the broader study of ethnic and racial boundaries as they interact with linguistic boundaries. Furthermore, it will enhance our understanding of identity in post-colonial contexts, particularly as it concerns Native American groups and the processes of acculturation and identity formation. <br/><br/>The results will have significant political as well as academic impact. For instance, federal government policy involving the recognition of native groups is based on and informed by scholarly approaches to identity, ethnicity, and language. An important corollary of this study will be the documentation of the language for the purposes of cultural documentation and language revitalization."

The importance of closing the achievement gap is underscored by estimations that the majority of school-aged persons in the U.S. will be non-white or Hispanic by the year 2035. Decades of research reveal that ethnic and racial discrimination, including negative racial experiences with teachers and peers in school, seriously undermines academic adjustment. The proposed research will explore how socio-culturally specific parenting practices thought to buffer the effects of discrimination on development may facilitate achievement among ethnic and racial minority youth. Specifically, this research will examine how the interplay between parental ethnic-racial socialization at home, and perceived discrimination at school, shapes youths' motivation and academic trajectories. This objective will be achieved by working with the scholars, resources and data at the New York University's Center for Research on Culture, Development and Education (CRCDE). As a postdoctoral fellow at the Center, the fellow will take courses and participate in seminars and colloquia to expand their knowledge of relevant psychological constructs, statistical techniques and research methodology. The fellow will also collaborate with leading scholars to hone her research, writing and presentation skills. Working with Dr. Hughes at the CRCDE is pivotal to the training of the fellow; Dr. Hughes is a pioneering researcher in the area of ethnic-racial socialization, and under her direct mentorship the fellow will learn to apply mixed methods and advanced quantitative techniques to examine the impact of racial and cultural constructs on academic adjustment. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. Ethnic-racial socialization, the process through which parents convey messages to children about ethnicity and race, plays a crucial role in the development of minority youth. Some dimensions of parental messages (e.g., transmitting cultural pride, instilling egalitarianism) are found to facilitate positive identity, self-esteem, efficacy, and motivation, factors that are negatively impacted by discrimination, and that underlie academic adjustment. However, few studies have examined the relation between ethnic-racial socialization and academic outcomes. To advance understanding in this area, the fellow will examine how different patterns of ethnic-racial socialization at home, and perceived discrimination in school, interact to shape motivational factors that drive academic engagement and performance over time. The fellow will also conduct exploratory research to examine how ethnic-racial socialization may promote socio-culturally specific achievement goals (e.g., excelling to disprove stereotypes) that may also contribute to academic outcomes, and that are not yet specified in current models of achievement motivation. This research will be conducted in a longitudinal sample of African, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Chinese, and European American youth. The nature of these data, which represent five ethnic groups, spans 6th through 12th grade, and includes qualitative and quantitative reports from multiple sources (children, parents and teachers), will enable the fellow to answer questions that previous research has been unable to address. The fellow will also utilize both variable-centered and person-centered analyses, in order to capture the multidimensional, interactive nature of parental messages and explore their joint influences. This research will (1) advance knowledge in an under-researched area that is central to ethnic minority development and achievement, (2) apply a substantive theoretical model that elaborates mediational processes and the interplay of multiple contexts, (3) contribute to a more nuanced understanding of ethnic-racial socialization, (4) explore socio-culturally specific achievement goals which have yet to be identified, and (5) identify common and culturally specific processes across multiple groups. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Broader personal impacts of this fellowship activity include building the skills, expertise, and publication record necessary to achieve these important career goals: gaining a tenure track position at a major research university, conducting culturally sensitive research, and applying an integrative framework to examine how various contexts affect development in vulnerable populations. Broader practical impacts include advancing knowledge about racially and culturally relevant processes in child development, elucidating how ethnic-racial socialization shapes adolescent motivation and achievement, and identifying factors that may be integrated into interventions aimed at closing the achievement gap. Findings generated from this research will be disseminated through publications and presentations targeted to a variety of audiences, including researchers, educators, parents and policymakers, interested in increasing the participation of underrepresented populations in higher education, research, and STEM fields."

Several recent trends add weight to the crisis. First, within the next 50 years, people identified as ethnic ""minority"" will comprise half the U.S. population. Second, new waves of immigrants continue to arrive, ensuring fundamental but unknown changes in the intercultural dynamics of schools and other contexts. Third, the United States has evolved into a ""knowledge-driven"" economy, making a solid education, particularly in math and science, vital for an increasingly large sector of the workforce. Finally, recent federal legislation calls for annual standardized assessments of school children, a prospect that may disadvantage certain minorities who typically underperform on these tests. More than ever, a sizable proportion of our nation's children are at risk of academic failure, posing a serious threat to the current Administration's goal of ""leaving no child behind."" In line with this national goal, the Center for Research on Culture, Development and Education (CRCDE), housed at New York University (NYU) will conduct research designed to identify pathways to academic success for all children. Prior research has focused narrowly on a single context (e.g., the family, peer relationships, school quality, etc.) in predicting academic outcomes, or has investigated the roles of ethnicity, race, immigrant status, gender, or socioeconomic status separately. Neither approach, however, has adequately addressed the ways in which multiple contexts contribute to educational success and/or disparities, nor how pathways vary by developmental period and culture. Furthermore, an over-emphasis on group differences has resulted in the neglect of patterns of academic outcomes within ethnic, socioeconomic, or cultural groups. Finally, studies across all of these areas have tended to utilize single methodologies, rarely integrating survey, ethnographic, experimental, and observational methods. To address these gaps, the CRCDE will gather and disseminate data about the pathways that lead to successful academic engagement and performance among culturally diverse children and adolescents. The scientific mission of the CRCDE is to use an integrative conceptual framework, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and multiple methods to (1) identify the nature of relationships that link children's experiences in five educationally relevant contexts, home, school, peers, caregivers' work, and media, to their academic engagement and performance; (2) examine whether and how these processes vary within and across cultural groups and across developmental periods; and (3) advance an understanding of how home, peers, school, caregivers' work, and media affect one another and jointly influence children's and adolescents' academic engagement and performance. The educational mission of the CRCDE is to (1) train a new generation of scholars, especially those from underrepresented minority groups, to engage in research that advances the scientific mission; (2) produce instruments and methods that will strengthen the scientific capacity of the research community to conduct culturally sensitive research on academic engagement and performance; and (3) transmit findings to policy makers, practitioners in education, and researchers, through dissemination of findings and lessons for educational policy and practice. The Center's location in the diverse context of New York City (NYC) is ideal for a center devoted to research at the confluence of culture, development, and education."

In urban cities, the vast majority of children entering preschool/elementary school and high school are Latino, Asian or African American, and how well these children and their families adjust to these high-stake school transitions will have long term implications for children's developmental outcomes as well as the future of the U.S. In the context of growing diversity among the nation's children, systematic inquiry into the experiences and developmental pathways of children from different cultural communities during periods of major transitions is urgently needed. <br/><br/>In response, the NYU IRADS builds on 5 years of research under NYU's Center for Research on Culture, Development and Education (CRCDE), and seeks to advance scientific theory and knowledge on children's social, emotional and cognitive development in ethnically diverse populations. Plans are to follow a group of 900 urban, predominantly low-income and working class families of Mexican, Dominican, Chinese, European and African American decent with young children (4-7 years) and adolescents (13-17 years) as children enter preschool/elementary school and high school. The majority of these families have participated in the research of the CRCDE over the past several years, and have already provided rich information on the background experiences of these children and families beginning at children's birth (in the early childhood group) and entry into middle school (in the adolescent group). The five ethnic groups were selected for study, as they comprise the majority of children in New York City. In addition, they enable contrasts among groups with different immigration statuses, histories of discrimination related to race and skin color, citizenship status, and language and cultural backgrounds. <br/><br/>The planned activities involve continued gathering of original data on aspects of children's cognitive, social, and emotional development and experiences in home and school settings that would be most sensitive to children's experiences across critical transitions. Within the area of social development, focus will be on social competence and social identity. For cognitive development, focus will be on language/literacy, math concepts and performance, classification skills, attention abilities, and academic performance and engagement. For emotional development, focus will be on children's emotion regulation. Together, these skills form the building blocks for healthy developmental outcomes. In home and school settings, focus will be on the beliefs and practices of parents, teachers and children; the quality of relationships (e.g., parent-child, teacher child); and financial resources. <br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of this research includes the generation of new, culturally grounded theory and knowledge on the development and experiences of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds across multiple developmental areas, social settings, and significant developmental transitions. The Broader Impacts are framed by a set of integrated plans to advance research and education on ethnically diverse populations through the: (1) training of a new generation of scholars (especially underrepresented minorities) to engage in research that advances the scientific mission; (2) sharing of instruments, methods, and findings so as to strengthen the scientific capacity of researchers to engage in culturally sensitive studies of children's development; (3) dissemination of findings to researchers, educators and policy makers through publications, trainings, briefings and community outreach; and (4) strengthening of local, national, and international partnerships."

The effect of uneven growth and economic inequality on the potential for violent social conflict is the subject of this project. It continues and extends a research program on economic development, distribution and conflict. That program rests on two core assertions. First, social conflict has strong economic correlates: variables such as per-capita income and natural resource revenues shape the incidence and extent of such conflict. Yet, classical expressions of conflict between economic haves and have-nots are relatively rare; often, warring groups are demarcated by noneconomic markers such as ethnicity or religion. Previous research has shown that ethnic polarization and fractionalization strongly influences conflict. <br/><br/>The current project takes the research a step further by considering the economic characteristics of ethnic groups and how these enter into the determination of social conflict over and above the demographic characteristics. The analysis begins with a significant extension of the theoretical framework introduced by Esteban and Ray (American Economic Review vol. 101, 1345-1374, 2011) to include joint economic and demographic determinants of ethnic conflict. It is shown that the two sets of variables interact in specific ways, that discipline the functional relationships to be tested and (in some cases) estimated. The emphasis in is on within-group and cross-group economic inequality and its effects on conflict. The empirical exercise based on the theory is applied to a cross-section of countries.<br/><br/>The project then uses the same framework to inform an empirical study of Hindu-Muslim violence in India. The emphasis in this section is on changes in group per-capita incomes (rather than within-group distribution). It is argued that Muslim group incomes in India have been positively associated with subsequent religious conflict, while the opposite is true of Hindu incomes. The theory permits an interpretation of this striking empirical finding.<br/><br/>The last part of the project theoretically examines a number of complementary arguments that point towards the salience of ethnic violence in the face of economic disparity and uneven change. This part of the project takes a very different route from traditional hypotheses, which would associate such economic characteristics with a greater probability of class, not ethnic, conflict.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: the study of violent conflict, especially within developing countries, is of immense importance. Uneven growth often involves significant reallocation of resources, human and physical. Even if such growth is warranted from a long-term perspective, it can bring immense hardship in the short to medium run, and it can do so to individuals and groups who will never be adequately compensated in their lifetime. Does economic growth stifle conflict, or might it exacerbate it? What is the relationship between inequality and conflict? Why might class conflict give way to ethnic conflict? The objective is to show how the economic theory of conflict gives rise to a new set of testable predictions which integrates economics, politics and demography. It is hoped that political scientists, sociologists and ethnographers will find such an attempt useful and complementary to their own work. <br/><br/>To this end, the current project continues to push towards a book on the economics of ethnic violence. The intention is to put together, in a cohesive way, a large literature from economics, political science and sociology on the topic of conflict in developing countries. The principal investigator plans to develop and teach a course on ""Uneven Growth and Conflict,"" to develop a detailed outline for the writing of such a book."

CDEI is based on a classification of political parties around the world in a given year as ethnic, multiethnic and on-ethnic. The Principal Investigator uses this classification to generate over forty variables related to ethnicity and institutions.<br/>The variable that gets the highest priority in the time-series expansion is EVOTE -- the percentage of vote<br/>obtained by ethnic political parties in each country for the year 1996. The PI codes several other variables<br/>related to the implicit and explicit mobilization of ethnic identities by political parties.<br/>The purpose in building and expanding CDEI is to test competing propositions on the rise of ethnic parties and<br/>democratic stability. According to a classic proposition in empirical democratic theory, ethnically divided societies invariably give rise to ethnic political parties and ethnic political parties destabilize a democratic system. But other work argues or implies that no matter how they arise, ethnic parties may have the opposite effect they may actually stabilize democracy by institutionalizing discontent which might otherwise be expressed through violence.<br/>Because of the lack of cross-national data on ethnic political parties and the degree of support they obtain in<br/>democratic systems, neither proposition has been empirically verified. We do have cross-national data on ethnic groups, which, input into the Index of Ethnolinguistic Fractionalization (ELF), have been the basis for studies that explore the relationship between ethnic diversity and democratic stability. But these data, and the ELF index, are divorced from a theoretical understanding of the nature of ethnic groups. Although theories of the origin of ethnic groups are constructivist, the data on ethnic groups and the ELF measure remain resolutely primordialist. As a result, we do not know what the relationship between any aspect of ethnicity and democratic stability is despite the large body of work on the subject. CDEI, which incorporates constructivist insights, and is specifically designed to test propositions in democratic theory about the origins and effects of ethnic political parties, aims to fill one part of this gap.<br/>Although CDEI is motivated by my own interest in testing propositions linking ethnic party behavior and democratic consolidation, the data it generates can be used to answer a very broad range of questions in the social sciences about the origins and effects of politicized ethnic identities and therefore to inform public policy on the relationship between politicized ethnic identities and political and economic outcomes. A sample of such questions includes the following: What is the effect of the explicit politicization of ethnic divisions on some outcome of interest, including war, riots, economic growth, public policy, welfare spending and so on? Is the politicization of particular types of ethnic divisions associated (e.g. region or religion or language or tribe) associated with particular types of outcomes? What determines the size of the coalition that an ethnic party is likely to mobilize? Are we more likely to see the ethnification of politics in new democracies? Is there a link between colonial history and the degree of ethnic politicization? How rapidly do politically activated ethnic identities change over time and what explains such change? Is there a link between ethnic majoritarianism and conflict? And so on.<br/>Broader Social Value: The Principal Investigator facilitates the broad use of the data generated by CDEI in two ways: (1) By inviting the involvement of other scholars in the design of the dataset, making the data widely available and offering an intensive introduction in the design of the dataset to those who wish to use it. The researcher does this through a combination of web-based portals and face-toface workshops. (2) By integrating the data collection process into graduate student education. Graduate students are currently involved as collaborators and co-authors in all aspects of the project, and the researcher plans to introduce a new laboratory course that combines theoretical instruction with hands on experience in data collection at NYU."

Does ethnic diversity cause economic underdevelopment, and if so, how? This dissertation research seeks to explain why so many ethnically diverse countries are underdeveloped, and how some have managed to avoid the poverty traps in which so many of their peers languish. Government institutions provide the key. The incentive structures defined by these institutions determine how ethnicity is channeled into or away from politics and the political allocation of scarce resources: some institutions produce relatively benign outcomes, while others favor zero-sum redistributive politics based on ethnic identity. <br/><br/>To accomplish this goal, the PI employs a multi-method research design. Econometric analysis of cross-national data will allows the PI to test the impact of ethnic diversity and government institutions at the level of the system against a broad sample of countries. To explore the microfoundations of the aggregation process, the PI will collect individual-level data in Lebanon and Yemen via a combination of elite interviews, population surveys, and vignette experiments attached to the surveys. <br/><br/>This dissertation research fills several important gaps in our understanding of how ethnic diversity affects economic development. It contributes to political science by expanding our understanding of how government institutions channel, and possibly pre-empt, potential social cleavages. It augments our understanding of economic development in divided societies by analyzing the ways in which latent cleavages are either reinforced or diluted by the institutions that translate them into political competition. Finally, this project has potentially far-reaching policy implications. Insofar as government institutions are potential policy levers, understanding how they function in different societies can help policymakers select institutions that can help mitigate the potentially negative effects of ethnic divisions.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impact, this dissertation will help inform policymaker decisions toward appropriate government responses and institutions with the aim of mitigating the impact of ethnically-based political competition on economic development. Hence, beyond its interest to academics, it speaks to the puzzles and concerns facing government officials in ethnically diverse states, as well as those working for international development agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. A better understanding of the role government institutions play in magnifying or reducing the impact of ethnic diversity on development will aid in formulating appropriate devel-opment policy."

Multiculturalism is popularly equated with respect for hitherto underrepresented racial, ethnic, class, gender and other minority groups. However, research suggests multiculturalism policies also can maintain and reinforce hierarchies by dividing and subordinating minority groups in subtler ways. The discourse of multiculturalism only recently emerged since the 1990s in Japan, where the ideology of ethnic and cultural homogeneity is still dominant and perpetuated.<br/><br/>Cho will study this emerging phenomenon through research on diasporic Okinawans and Okinawa popular culture in Osaka. Okinawans have been the most successful among ethnic minorities in addressing their ethnic difference through popular culture, with the increased risk of further exoticization and commercialization of their difference. Combining participant observation, ethnographic interviews, media text analysis, and media reception studies, the researcher will explore the ways in which popular cultural practices are related to changing attitudes about ethnic relations in Japan. She will also investigate how the interactions between marginalized and dominant social groups may lead to political change through the mediation of popular culture. In doing so, this research seeks to explicate the ramifications of the emerging politics of multiculturalism in Japan.<br/><br/>The research is important because it will be one of the first studies of the emergence of multiculturalism politics in a non-western setting.

The purpose of this study is to explore racial/ethnic identity among a group of Arab immigrants who occupy a specific economic position as small business entrepreneurs in Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan. The study will explore the immigration and employment experiences of members of the group and describe the factors that are associated with entrepreneurship as a career trajectory. It seeks to describe the ways in which Arab immigrant entrepreneurs define their race/ethnic identity in relation to the US system of racial categorization and a white/black dyad. It will also attempt to delineate whether and how business location - Detroit's inner city versus Dearborn's ethnic enclave - and gender shape racial/ethnic identity. We will employ a qualitative research design relying on participant observation and in-depth interviews with male and female business owners. Dearborn and Detroit provide an ideal site to carry out a study of this nature given that Arab immigrants are structurally incorporated into the two locations in two distinct forms: as middleman minorities in the predominantly African American city of Detroit and as owners of ethnic businesses in a viable ethnic enclave in Dearborn. The broader impact of this study lies in its potential to contribute to the expansion of theoretical frameworks on immigrant entrepreneurship and ethnic economies, to contribute to the literature on immigration and race/ethnic identity construction and to the literature on whiteness, and to offer an alternative narrative about the experiences of Arab immigrants in the US, a group that is currently the subject of much attention."

Israel is unique because it was formed through massive, concentrated immigration form a variety of countries. Despite significant heterogeneity in educational and occupational attainments among these immigrants, a bifurcated social structure emerged, such that Middle Eastern and North African Jews tended to be lower in both occupational status and control of economic and political resources than European Jews. Using Israel's 1961 census, this research will compare occupation prior to immigration with occupation after immigration. Specifically, the research will investigate the effects of ethnicity, class and a number of practical and cultural resources that enables an individual to translate prior occupational attainment into occupational attainment in Israel. Using secondary historical materials, scholarly and media publications on Israel's ethnic gap, and Zionist writings, the investigator will examine the group-level processes that account for the role of ethnicity in Israel's occupational attainment system. This research will increase our theoretical and practical knowledge of the importance of ethnicity to individual opportunity, the utility of specific individual-level resources in combating ethnic discrimination, the relative roles of class and ethnicity in shaping macro-level ethnic inequality, and the level of conscious strategy present in ethnic competition for socially valued objects. ****"

The PI will focus on spatial variation in income inequality, local demand for labor overall and low skill labor in particular, and local variation in race/ethnic inequality to explain the career dynamics of low skill workers. A prominent explanation for rising race/ethnic inequality is the spatial mismatch hypothesis that points toward the spatial location of African Americans and whites relative to the location and skill requirements of available jobs. There are also well documented spatial variations in the degree of race/ethnic competition, segregation, and discrimination. Therefore, it is expected that the prospects of low skilled workers are strongly tied to both their race/ethnicity and their opportunities in local labor markets. The investigators will develop a model of career inequality, which focuses on the endogenous creation of human capital disparities across the career.<br/><br/>How do local labor market opportunities and local race/ethnic inequality shape the cumulative labor market experiences and earnings of low skilled workers? The investigators will develop tentative answers to this question using the National Longitudinal Survey - Youth Sample. The analytic strategy is to use three-level hierarchical linear models. In these models person-year outcomes and human capital attributes are at level one, fixed individual characteristics such as race, ethnicity, or gender are at level two, and characteristics of the local labor market are at level three.<br/><br/>The research seeks to make two two key scientific advances. The first is the explicit conceptualization of human capital acquisition as endogenous to the labor market and so consistent with contextualized accounts of labor market opportunity and discrimination. The second is the implementation of a statistical framework, which assumes that the context of decisions and behaviors is important, and that fixed individual attributes and attributes of localities are the interactional context of human capital acquisition and returns."

Under what conditions does ethnicity affect the different treatment of ethnic-others? To answer these questions, the project will study the patterns of violence in the villages of two municipalities in Bosnia-Herzegovina --Prijedor and Sanski Most-- during the civil war from 1992 to 1995. These municipalities are contiguous, were under the control of Serb forces throughout the civil war, and present similar demographic characteristics. Yet the Muslim and Croat population in Prijedor experienced a much harsher treatment than in Sanski Most, and within each municipality some villages were exposed to harsher measures compared to others. <br/> The project has the following intellectual merits. First, it goes beyond the existing literature on civil wars by focusing on the processes of violence once a civil war starts rather than the initial causes of the violence. Second, it problematizes the role of ethnicity in civil wars fought between forces split along ethnic lines. The conventional wisdom in the field of political science so far has been that ethnicity plays a significant role in these contexts. However, the existence of village level variation in the treatment of ethnic- others in areas under the control of one ethnic group raises questions about the significance of ethnicity as a motivation for violence. The proposed project will advance knowledge about the role of ethnicity in violent contexts by both testing it against alternative explanations such as military strategy, and by exploring whether and why the importance of ethnicity varies from village to village. The Co-PI for the project has been learning Serbo-Croat to be able to engage in research in Bosnia-Herzegovina since September 2002 and has conducted exploratory research in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the summer of 2003. <br/> The broader impacts of the study are threefold. First, the proposed project will generate data at the level of small units such as villages, which is rare in studies of violence. Thus the project will provide data for other researchers who want to study micro-dynamics of violence. (The results and the data will be shared with the academic community, will be published in academic journals, and presented as part of doctoral dissertation). Second, the study will be the first to engage in field research to study the patterns of violence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This type of research is important, as several scholars have used the case to propose solutions to ethnic wars, yet these recommendations have relied on assumptions about the role of ethnicity in Bosnia during the civil war, rather than empirical work. Finally, along with other projects with similar questions, the proposed project would contribute to the accumulation of knowledge on which regions are more likely to be in need of humanitarian aid and intervention during civil wars."

The project will add samples of Hmong and Cambodian refugees from different urban areas to an existing data base on minority identity among Southeast Asian refugees. The quantitative data base is a survey of 50 Hmong in a small, nearly all-white city and 50 Cambodians in a large, multicultural city. Even with control variables, the Hmong consistently have a stronger minority identity as measured by social distance, expectations of discrimination, and the belief that their group is disliked by native whites. The project seeks to determine if this difference is due to ethnicity or urban location. Qualitative data from follow-up interviews suggests that ethnicity is a cause of the variation. Cambodian ethnicity has fluid ethnic boundaries which leads to a weak sense of in- and out-group opposition. Hmong ethnicity has rigid ethnic boundaries which leads to a strong opposition between in- and out-groups. Fluid or rigid ethnic boundaries are due to (1) being a majority or minority group in the homeland, (2) one's view of the U.S. state in the Vietnam War, and (3) the role of ancestry in creating kinship groups. Obtaining samples of Hmong from a large, multicultural city and Cambodians from a small, nearly all-white city will provide the needed data to establish that homeland ethnicity can minimize or magnify the formation of a minority identity in the United States."

Data is being collected on local public goods, including school funding, maintenance of wells, and community participation in village meetings. The resulting dataset provides information on the impact of ethnic divisions on public good provision across a variety of settings and outcomes. Preliminary empirical results indicate that higher local ethnic diversity is associated with sharply lower local funding and worse facilities across ninety rural Kenyan primary schools. The drop in funding associated with the change from complete ethnic homogeneity to median school ethnic diversity is approximately 25 percent of average local school funding, and this relationship is robust to the inclusion of geographic, socioeconomic, demographic and teacher quality controls. Ethnically diverse areas also have lower community participation in school committee meetings, as well as substantially worse water well maintenance in rural western Kenya.<br/>Second, the research examines how central government policies toward ethnicity affect inter-ethnic relations and public goods provision, by comparing outcomes across two nearby rural districts: one in western Kenya and one in western Tanzania. Despite their shared geography, history, and colonial legacy, central governments in Kenya and Tanzania have followed radically different ethnic policies since independence.<br/>Finally, the research explores the impact of a recent local government decentralization reform in Tanzania - which was gradually phased-in across villages - on local public good outcomes. The unique dataset collected in this project allows the author to test the hypothesis that decentralization reforms improve public good outcomes, and to explore whether such reforms are less effective in ethnically diverse areas due to local collective action failures. Understanding the impacts of decentralization in diverse communities has important policy implications given the current movement toward decentralization in many African and other less developed countries.<br/>The field data collection in Tanzania is being conducted in collaboration with a capable local non-governmental organization that has a well-trained research field staff and data entry group.

Theoretical arguments often attribute the problems to the fact that ethnic divisions result in divergent group preferences. However, the core measure in empirical research on the problems with heterogeneous societies is ethno-linguistic fractionalization (ELF), which contains no information about the likelihood of particular groups holding divergent preferences. Since the ELF measure assumes that substantive differences between all groups are the same, its use requires the implicit assumption that the potential for group-based conflict within a society is simply a function of how likely an individual is to interact with someone from a different group. Yet we know that individuals from different ethnic groups often have similar preferences. <br/><br/>For a large number of issues that arise in politics, group economic differences will be at the core of inter-group disputes. Income differences across groups can lead to different needs with respect to public goods, feelings of alienation or discrimination, different attitudes toward redistribution, and different ""class"" identities. The central objective of this research project is therefore to draw on household income and budget surveys to create a new cross-national dataset that measures economic differences across groups.<br/><br/>The data will be useful for exploring how ethnic, linguistic, and regional economic differences are related to outcomes that have been central to the literature on ethnic heterogeneity. These include economic growth, public goods provision, redistribution and conflict. By incorporating information about economic differences into measures of ethnic cleavages, it will be possible to explore more carefully the mechanisms that have been proposed to link ethnicity with poor outcomes. The data will also open a range of new research opportunities.<br/><br/>The primary benefit of the study will be to enhance the infrastructure for research and education by creating and disseminating a cross-national data set that measures inter-group economic differences. The data set, which will be made up of 80-100 countries, will include a wide range of measures of inter-group economic differences. It will also include standard ethnic fractionalization and polarization scores."

Ghana has an uncertain economy where warranties on manufactured products are not common. In order to sell products, manufacturers must earn trust from customers and convince them that their products are good quality and that they will take good care of them when the products have problems. Like other African countries, however, Ghana is an ethnically divided society, and it is often difficult to develop trust relationships across ethnic groups. If such relationships were confined within one's own ethnic group, the market would be severely limited. However, pilot study results conducted by the investigator in Ghana indicate that some manufacturers have more customers from varied ethnic groups and more total sales than others. One possible explanation is that successful ones rely on broad identities based on religion rather that on narrower identities based on ethnicity. Building on data and analyses of the pilot study, the project collects and analyzes additional data on ethnic and religious identities in Ghana, and their influence on entrepreneurial success."

Sugerman, Mary Larkum will test the hypothesis that the study of archaeological food remains is a useful method to investigate ancient ethnic groups. The presence or absence of specific food remains, such as pig bones, has been used as an indicator of ethnic boundaries in the archaeological record of Israel, Palestine and Jordan, a region also called the southern Levant. Larkum will research two different sources of data on dietary practices: (1) faunal remains (animal bones) using macroscopic skeletal analysis and (2) food residues extracted from cooking pottery using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). The bones and pottery were excavated at sites dating to the Iron Age II Period (1000 - 586 BCE) in the southern Levant. These sites were situated in regional kingdoms known historically as Ammon, Aram, Edom, Israel, Judah, Moab and Philistia.<br/><br/>In the food residue portion of this project Larkum focuses on animal products cooked in unglazed cooking pottery, a common Iron Age food preparation method, and specifically examines cooking pottery excavated from domestic floors for information about the non-ritual use of animal products in Iron Age homes. She also inventories the range of animals represented in each site's faunal assemblage for comparison with residue data. The study of cooking residues complements the dietary information obtained from faunal remains, and adds a deeper analysis of social practice to interpretations of ancient ethnicity. This research has the potential to broadly impact how archaeologists and historians think about ancient south Levantine peoples and the archaeological methods used to interpret ancient identity. Larkum will comment on the use of food remains as ethnic markers, contribute to debates on ancient food use, and provide new information about south Levantine cooking and the use of cooking vessels during the Iron Age. The combined use of organic residue and faunal analyses is a new approach to the study of ancient ethnicity, one that offers an opportunity to employ tried and tested analytical methods in an innovative way. <br/><br/>This project will make an intellectual contribution to three bodies of anthropological literature: the archaeology of ethnicity, the archaeology of the Levant, and the anthropology of food and nutrition. Comparing cooking and faunal data will examine the process of cooking as a culturally significant behavior, placing the discussion of regional food use into a larger context of food and culture in anthropology. Results of this research will be submitted for publication to peer-reviewed journals and edited excavation volumes, and presented at national anthropological conferences. An Internet database of reference sample GC/MS spectra will be made available for on-line use to benefit the scientific community. The Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant will provide Mary Larkum with valuable graduate student training in the analysis of chemical residues and archaeological fauna."

Sharer, Greg Borgstede will conduct investigations on the archaeology of ethnicity in the western highlands of Guatemala among the Huista and Acateco Maya currently living in the area. The primary purpose of the research is to uncover the material remains of ethnic identity among groups with no written history. The Huista-Acateco Archaeological Project (HAAP) will focus on two distinct, homogenous ethnic groups, in a relatively small region, in order to ascertain how and when ethnic changes occurred in the two groups. This case is ideal for the study of the archeology of ethnicity since the Huista and Acateco Maya are today two distinct, homogenous ethnic groups. Their small population size and the relatively small area inhabited make archeological studies of both groups feasible. Two questions will be addressed: Can modern ethnic groups be identified in or correlated with the archaeological record? And what is the relation between an ethnic group's modern situation and its historical development, as shown through archaeology and its material traces? In an attempt to answer these questions, the HAAP will consist of: archaeological surveys, primarily locating and mapping archaeological sites in the previously unstudied region; archaeological excavations of the discovered sites; analysis of artifacts; and oral history collection. <br/><br/>The changing nature of culture at the turn of the millennium, as many social scientists have pointed out, is toward increased globalization, normalization, and westernization. While this is undoubtedly true, it masks the increased regionalization and balkanization of many cultures of the world: processes that are often phrased in terms of ethnic groups and ethnic identity. These ethnic groups often base claims of political and cultural identity on long historical cultural continuity. Historians have addressed these claims in cases where historical records are available, but archaeologists have largely ignored the topic. <br/><br/>The significance of the HAAP is that it will analyze the relevance of archaeology to conceptions of ethnic identity. The results will be directly applicable to these groups themselves, particularly in their claims to cultural and political representation in the Guatemalan society. These groups, marginalized because of decades of civil war, have only recently begun to develop a sense of cultural self-determination, and an interest in their own, unwritten history. The results will also provide a broader framework for understanding how ethnicity can be traced through the material remains available to archaeology."

The team brings together U.S., Dutch, and Guatemala specialists in archaeology, ethnohistory, and linguistics to examine the interface between migration theory and the archaeological identification of Nahua/Pipil ethnicity at the major site complex of Carolina-Gomera believed to be a major Pipil regional center. The Postclassic period in Mesoamerica was marked by massive social, political, economic, and demographic upheaval following the collapse of Classic period polities in Mexico and Guatemala. While the causes of these cataclysmic events are obscure one salient fact is the Nahua migrations from central Mexico and the Gulf Coast to Pacific Guatemala and lower Central America that are believed to have occurred in a series of movements from about A.D. 800 to A.D. 1350. The migrations of Nahua-speaking groups from Mexico to Central America constitute one of the most important examples of large-scale population movements in New World culture history. The recent discovery of large Late Postclassic regional centers that are most likely Pipil on the central Guatemala Pacific Coast are the basis for the project and present a rare opportunity to combine both documentary and archaeological research in a conjunctive approach. The goal is to develop a general understanding of the Pipil migratory process that is closely interrelated with the archaeological identification of Pipil ethnicity.<br/><br/>The nature of the research questions require basic data principally in residential areas that allow the identification of Pipil ethnic groups. Once this accomplished the chronological problems associated with the Pipil migrational process itself can be approached together with the reconstruction of their settlement system, social differentiation, and household economy. Specific tasks are 1) completely map Carolina, Gomera, and all surrounding rural centers, 2) complete the extensive survey and collection of surface materials in and around the same centers, 3) conduct test excavations of a stratified sample of patio groups at all sites and the lateral exposure of a sample of these, 4) complete the analysis of all collected artifacts, 5) to integrate the documentary data with the survey and excavation data.<br/><br/>The Late Postclassic project will provide much needed information at both theoretical and substantive levels. The intellectual merit of the research will be to test models of migration and methods of identifying ethnicity, two of the most contentious issues confronting contemporary archaeology. The broader impacts of the study are that it will contribute significant information during an obscure period and since no project has ever focused on the Late Postclassic period in the region, the substantial increase in knowledge will provide the basis for major revisions in the scientific understanding of the prehistory of this dynamic region. Guatemala and U.S. students will participate in the project to enhance their training and increase their knowledge of the importance of Pacific Guatemala's prehistory."

What are the implications of ethnic residential segregation for economic performance? 2. What is the impact of immigration on native earnings and employment opportunities? 3. To what extent does the internal migration of native workers attenuate the regional wage differentials created by immigration? Are native workers sufficiently mobile so that that immigration has little effect on wage differentials across local labor markets? 4. What factors determine the socioeconomic experiences of immigrant children in the United States?

Developmental researchers have provided evidence that there are growth spurts in these behaviors across childhood and adolescence. However, existing models of prosocial development have been guided mostly by theories that emphasize the role of social cognitions and/or emotions on prosocial and moral behaviors. For the most part, the role of culture and ethnicity on prosocial development has been less clear in these theories, even though there is clear evidence of cultural and ethnic differences in prosocial development. Although both social cognitions and emotions are significant correlates of prosocial behaviors, new theories of prosocial development are needed that integrate the role of culture and ethnicity in prosocial development. Unfortunately, the bulk of the research investigating the developmental mechanisms that lead to prosocial development has been conducted with white, mostly middle class, children. Thus, our understanding of the development and predictors of prosocial behaviors in ethnic minority children is quite limited. To begin to address these issues, research is needed on the development of prosocial behaviors in ethnic minority children and adolescents. This project is designed to examine parenting, sociocognitive, and culture-related correlates of prosocial behaviors across childhood and early adolescence in one ethnic minority group (i.e., Mexican Americans). The two-phased systematic research agenda will combine qualitative and quantitative approaches. The overarching goal of the project is to gain an understanding of positive, social behaviors in Mexican American and European American children in the United States. The project is designed primarily (a) to examine ethnic group similarities and differences with respect to prosocial traits and behaviors in Mexican American and European American children and (b) to investigate the parenting, familial, and sociocognitive correlates of prosocial behaviors in Mexican American and European American children. When completed, the research will answer a number of questions that social and developmental psychologists have advanced in recent years. These questions include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Is normal development of the abilities to understand another's point of view, to feel sorrow or concern for needy others, and to make moral decisions when faced with a context in which there are societially defined right and wrong behaviors associated with high levels of prosocial behaviors in both Mexican- and European-American children? (2) Do both Mexican- and European-American children who exhibit high levels of prosocial behaviors have parents who are warm and supportive and use explanatory and empathy-inducing disciplining practices? (3) Do Mexican American parents, compared to European American parents, emphasize collectivism (i.e., orientation towards greater social group) and familial interdependence, which in turn accounts for ethnic group differences in prosocial behaviors? (4) Do family and parenting processes impact or explain the relations of the abilities to understand another's point of view, to feel sorrow or concern for needy others, and to make moral decisions to prosocial behaviors in Mexican- and European-American children? (5) Do the adaptations that Mexican American children make to the mainstream and ethnic cultures as a result of the processes of acculturation and enculturation impact prosocial development. By addressing these questions, this study is expected to yield important information about variables that might promote prosocial behaviors and produce useful and valuable new measures of prosocial behaviors to use with Mexican American children and adolescents.

The training takes place with Evelynn Hammonds, historian of science in the Science, Technology, and<br/>Science Department at MIT. Elements of the training program include learning the methods and modes of analysis of historical Research through coursework; directed reading; and participation in relevant workshops, colloquia, and activities of the newly established Center for the Study of Diversity in Science, Technology, and Medicine at MIT. The research activities focus on several issues:<br/> i) how the technology of lung function testing has been deployed to produce<br/>knowledge about race and ethnicity from the mid-19th century to the present; <br/>ii) the ways in which notions of difference became embedded in the practices of pulmonary and occupational medicine and why they have remained invisible to practitioners; <br/>iii) the relationship between popular and scientific theories of race and ethnicity; and iv) the socio-political consequences of the knowledge produced.<br/><br/>This research has several interrelated components. The first involves an examination of the explanations provided in the primary scientific literature for observed racial and ethnic differences in lung function. The second part of the project involves mapping the circulation of ideas on racial difference in lung anatomy, capacity, and disease in scientific disciplines -- physical anthropology, medicine, statistics, and epidemiology -- and popular culture, through an analysis of the scientific literature, conference proceedings, textbooks, popular journals, and newspapers. The third part examines contemporary understandings of the meaning of racial difference in lung function and the implications of those understandings in the medical subspecialties of occupational and pulmonary medicine through interviews with researchers, clinicians, and trade unionists. <br/><br/>The research is to be presented at the annual meeting of the Society for the Social Studies of Science and should lead to several papers published in academic journals. Braun also plans to develop a course on race and science to be offered at Brown University for undergraduate students on her return.

The methods will include intensive participant observation in the development organization as well as a census of eight local communities to assess their involvement in development projects, more intensive studies in two communities, one where projects are established and one where they are just being institutionalized. This research is important because most development projects implicitly or explicitly assume that local ethnicity will give way towards more Western, European, middle-class values and practices. Yet new development organizations are contesting that model, forging new approaches to join the best of local ethnic identity with developed institutions.

In Uganda, however, President Museveni's ethnic group, the Banyankole, comprise only nine percent of the population while Museveni is supported by a majority of the public. Clearly, large numbers of Ugandans must be voting for candidates outside of their ethnic group. Nevertheless, the Banyankole do seem to vote ethnically, supporting Museveni in numbers much higher than does the population as a whole. What explains this pattern of voting? Do Banyankole and non-Banyankole voters support Museveni for the same reasons?<br/><br/>The project hypothesizes that non-Banyankole voters, lacking ethnic cues, vote based on their assessments of Museveni's past performance in office. To explain the voting behavior of the Banyankole, the project examines five hypotheses from the literature. In two hypotheses, the Banyankole, like the non-Banyankole, vote purely based on assessments of Museveni's performance. Museveni's advantage among the Banyankole comes from the fact that his co-ethnics assess his performance more favorably, either because he has provided them with more goods or because they believe he has. In the second set of hypotheses, non-Banyankole still vote based on performance, while the Banyankole support Museveni specifically because he is of their ethnic group. Banyankole may vote for Museveni out of ethnic pride, because they believe a co-ethnic represents their best chance of future goods, or because they face social pressure to vote with their ethnic bloc. <br/><br/>The core of the study is a voting simulation experiment in which 750 respondents were asked to choose between candidates whose ethnicity, performance record and other characteristics have been randomly assigned. This test allows the researcher to determine if voters, whether Banyankole or not, rely on performance or ethnicity (or something else) as the basis of their vote. The voting simulation is also be used to test the social voting hypothesis: if social pressure determines voting, voters should be more likely to select co-ethnic candidates when asked to vote aloud among a group of co-ethnics than when marking a secret ballot. In the second part of the study, respondents rate their confidence that a hypothetical co-ethnic or non-co-ethnic candidate, if elected, would provide them with goods such as employment. This experiment determines whether, all things equal, voters expect more future goods from a co-ethnic candidate. Finally, the researcher creates inventories of household wealth and public service quality in 35 villages throughout Uganda. These data enable the researcher to determine whether the Banyankole have gained significantly more than other under Museveni's leadership and/or whether they overestimate what they receive. The data, compared to assessments of, predictions about, and votes for Museveni, indicate the importance of candidate performance, relative to ethnicity, in predicting vote share in the specific context of Ugandan politics. <br/><br/>The experimental nature of the study improves upon existing research on African voting by isolating and controlling the candidate characteristics and electoral conditions to which voters are exposed. In addition, the project will produce a unique new dataset that contains both objective and subjective indicators of public goods, in a way that allows real changes in these indicators to be linked to actual individual voting behavior. The findings, which will provide objective information about how Museveni distributes goods and how voters make their decisions, will be shared with multiple Ugandan research organizations conducting work on goods provision, and disseminated both through the public media and in direct mailings to leaders of areas in which the survey was conducted."

The project studies the role of the Soviet state in transforming notions of ethnicity and fair economic exchange among a group of forest hunters and reindeer herders of Subarctic Siberia. Using archival research and ethnographic methods, the student will investigate the growth of ethnic solidarity and out-group discrimination in this local society, and the relation of these value changes to the local group's incorporation into the larger Russian economy. This kind of research is important because the growth of local ethnic identities and ethnic-based discrimination is an ugly fact of life in many regions of the world.

This research project will look at how peoples maintain their sense of ethnic identity in the face of pressures to change: ethnicity will be studied on the Bonin Islands in the North Pacific. The population of these islands consists of the politically dominant Japanese and European/American colonists who have maintained a sense of separateness for over 100 years. The researcher predicts that the sharing of experiences as well as a sense of group identity rather than shared economic interests has kept the two groups separate. The research project's focus on ethnicity represents and important area in the social sciences that is in urgent need of clarification. Due to the unique features of the particular population identified in the proposal, the researcher will be able to add new dimensions to the concept used by all the social sciences. The formation and maintenance of ethnic identity will be fruitfully analyzed within the context of a particular historic and cultural setting. Ethnicity is emerging as a critical national issue in both developed and developing countries throughout the world. In South Africa, India, Israel, Canada, and the Philippines, to mention but a few countries, ethnicity lies at the center of cultural upheavals and threatens the stability of cultural and political institutions. In the U.S., a similar need for refinement of the conceptual framework of ethnicity underlies pressing social and economic problems."

In the mid-1950s, a gathering of preeminent Chinese social scientists and Communist Party cadres was given the task of partitioning China?s diverse population into distinct ethnic categories using explicitly non-biological criteria. Yet less than 50 years later, the development of the field of genetics in China and the initiation of the Chinese Human Genome Project in 1991 have spurred a flurry of medical and genetic research on ethnicity in China. This dissertation research project explores three questions: 1) why has ethnic classification in China shifted from a socio-linguistic project in the 1950s to a biologically based one beginning in the early 1980s; 2) what are the resulting tensions between these two competing logics of ethnic classification; and 3) why it is necessary for the Chinese government to distinguish between who is and who is not ethnically Han Chinese? This project examines the changing logic of ethnic classification using a combination of archival research, content analysis, and interview data. Data will be collected in seven Chinese cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, Urumqi, Guangzhou, Guilin and Lanzhou. China offers an interesting case to explore the importance of racial and ethnic classification projects in modern state formation and nation building, economic development and modernization, and in shaping systems of racial and ethnic domination. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This project seeks to create opportunities to engage the public on how genetic science and research has influenced our understandings of ethnic identity and ethnic boundaries. Of particular interest is finding ways to engage the public on how seemingly objective categories like race and ethnicity vary over time and place--issues that are beyond the scope of the public's everyday imagination. Such research is necessary not only in the classroom, but also in public discourse. In addition, this research project will foster knowledge in a part of the world where race and ethnicity are often overlooked. This research project's commitment to producing public sociology will contribute to the National Science Foundation's goals of integrating research and education; advancing diversity in science; enhancing scientific and technical knowledge; and benefiting society."

LM students are students who live in homes where a language other than English is spoken. ELLs are language minorities who have been identified as having limited proficiency in spoken and written English. This study will explore the interactions among school administrators, teachers, parents, and adolescent LM/ELL students from ethnic/language subgroups in the context of science learning in urban middle schools through a gender lens. Because national data are rarely disaggregated by gender, race or ethnicity, little is known about the educational needs, achievements, or problems of LM/ELL students, and specifically, how the needs of female LM/ELL students may differ from their male peers. This research will focus on adolescent LM/ELL students in science highlighting the role of gender in the context of ethnicity and culture in grades 6-8 science classrooms. The study is designed as an exploratory, three-year, mixed-methods study to examine the experiences of female and male LM/ELL students from particular marginalized subgroups, including Latinas/os (Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Mexican) and Southeast Asians (Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Indonesian) and Chinese (Fujianese, Cantonese, and mainland). In exploring the science learning experiences of linguistically and ethnically diverse female and male adolescent students the researchers will develop case study examples that illustrate relationships and tensions between learning science, students' gender, ELL status, ethnicity and class. Specifically, the research will explore inter-categorical complexity and socio-cultural learning theories.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The broader impact of this research will be the dissemination of findings to researchers,science teacher educators, K-12 educators, school administrators, and policymakers who can positively transform practices and policies to better support science learning for female and male LM and ELL students. Ultimately, these new understandings have the potential to increase male and female language minority students' participation in STEM fields, particularly females who are most significantly underrepresented in STEM majors and careers."

The space of the park in colonial Tanzania originated in delineation and <br/>control. Science brought race and nature into conversation through the establishment of racial and <br/>natural hierarchies and conservation's vilification of native African land use practices. Cartographic<br/>techniques and the tools of colonial governance helped demarcate the park as a physical manifestation <br/>of these assumptions. The park was not only a statement about the conservation of nature but an attempt to exclude and relegate native Africans to a position of inferiority in Tanzania. Through conservation and colonialism, the park came to symbolize racial and ethnic difference; space was 'racialized.' Drawing on a diverse literature this study examines the relationship among race, ethnicity, and conservation in colonial and contemporary Tanzania. The project will examine the impact of colonial legislation on parks, natives' land use, and the movement of natives; conservation policies and practices; and the experiences and assumptions of tourists and local people living near parks. The project will employ archival research and discourse analysis, participant observation and interviews with government officials and non-governmental employees. <br/>Intellectual Merits<br/>Cross-disciplinary thinking will inform the project's historical and scientific underpinnings. Because little <br/>research speaks specifically to the 'racialization' of space, this project builds on investigations in the sociology of knowledge, the sociology of race and ethnicity, and environmental sociology. The project's primary goal further aims to incorporate the lessons of philosophy into contemporary conservation policy in Tanzania. This multi-disciplinary approach extends to the project's methodology, which combines historical and ethnographic methods. With training and experience in participant observation and archival analysis, the researcher is well-prepared to do this study.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement grant, this project automatically pairs the goals of research and understanding with the promotion of academic learning.

It is primarily a three-year longitudinal study. The primary theoretical and empirical approach will be the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) model. There has been limited exploration of SCCT's utility in explaining choice actions or goal implementation relative to STEM majors.<br/><br/>Subjects are 210 first year, male and female undergraduates in computing sciences (over three successive years) at each of 50 institutions of higher education from across the nation: 25 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and 25 non-HBCUs. As a control/baseline for the study each year at each institution, Xavier will also survey 30 first-year undergraduates who are from a non-computing sciences group.<br/><br/>By participating in this research effort, several of the faculty members from the 50 institutions of higher education should become more interested in gender diversity and education. Microsoft Research and Science and Engineering Associates, Inc. (Louisiana's largest information technology company) will be corporate partners.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Based upon a large, nationwide sample, the team expects to be able to scientifically support from survey evidence some of the anecdotal or small sample findings previously put forth by other researchers. They expect to greatly improve the granularity of the current knowledge regarding gender, ethnicity, and culture in the computing sciences and to better support understanding of the computing sciences across the fields of psychology, sociology, and education. The comprehensive study features a multidisciplinary, culturally diverse, collaborative team capable of conducting the research. <br/><br/> Broader Impact: The results of the study could have a profound impact on teaching and learning in the computing sciences. It will inform new approaches to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, creating new networks and partnerships crossing disciplinary and geographical lines. Finally, it will give a scientifically sound basis from which others in society might work to increase the numbers of women obtaining bachelor's degrees in CS, CIS, or CE."

Few studies examine the influence of parents, and the combined effects of gender and ethnicity on science problem solving and interest. The researchers are examining how parent gender, child gender, and ethnicity affect science attitudes, problem-solving approaches (as well as parental help and encouragement) and the discipline of science problem that they prefer. The theoretical framework includes Vygotsky's and Rogoff's sociocultural theories, Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory and Bem's gender schema theory. One hundred and fifty fourth-grade boys and girls and their parents (with a balance of Hispanic and non-Hispanic families) are observed while solving six life and physical science problems together. Qualitative data (from parent-child problem-solving tasks and a child attitude interview) and quantitative data (from parent-child problem-solving tasks, a child science assessment, and a parental questionnaire) are collected and analyzed using content analysis and inferential statistics.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The research findings may assist researchers, parents and teachers to improve the participation and achievement of girls and Hispanic students in science disciplines. The dissemination plan includes presentations to professional audiences through conference presentations and publications, as well as brochures and websites for parents and teachers with advice about encouraging and assisting their students with science. Materials for parents will be made available to parent organizations, parenting magazines, libraries, and child care facilities. Brochures for teachers will be available to school districts, at local and national teacher conferences, and to pre-service teachers.

The UT program retains the size of eight students per year, which is ideal for teaching and research purposes. Minority Group Demography has been the organizing principle for this REU research program since 1989. The program continues this general theme over the next three years, but this time focusing particularly on the role of social context in producing racial and ethnic differences in criminal offending and criminal sanctioning. This thematic focus reflects the expertise of the two new principal investigators of the UT site, David Kirk and Keith Robinson (both faculty members in the Department of Sociology). <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the REU Site at UT is the academic and ethical development of junior social science scholars around a topic of immense importance to the United States. The goals are to provide REU students at UT with exposure, experience, and expertise. Precise program objectives have been developed to accomplish these goals. Exposure to social demography and sociology is accomplished via formal coursework and seminars. An undergraduate sociology course, The Demography of Crime and Punishment, comprises the first half of the summer. In addition, a series of professionalization workshops, or seminars are conducted during the summer. In these seminars, REU students discuss issues such as getting into graduate school and the myriad ethical concerns that social scientists confront during research. <br/><br/>REU students in this program gain concrete experience in three ways. First, through formal coursework, they learn about substantive issues concerning racial and ethnic differences in crime and punishment. Second, they are introduced to statistical analysis of social science data in a Stata programming lab and a GIS spatial data analysis workshop. Third, they experience intense mentoring from Population Research Center (PRC) graduate students and faculty affiliates as they work to produce a stand-alone deliverable scholarly paper by the end of the summer program. <br/><br/>Finally, the REU students demonstrate their expertise in two ways. They present their research to a gathering of PRC faculty affiliates, graduate students, and other invited scholars, and with travel support from the Population Research Center they present their REU research papers at the annual meeting of the American Society of Criminology (ASC). <br/><br/>The broader impact of this program is to influence the future of higher education in the social sciences, with special attention to the racial/ethnic and gender diversity of the future academic workforce. The successes of this long-running REU program are already evident, including students who have recently earned their Ph.D.s and have been placed at leading research universities, a number of students who are in leading graduate programs around the country, and others who have recently completed this REU program and will be moving on to graduate school.<br/><br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

This colonial boundary has left an enduring political rift between the nations of Senegal and The Gambia in spite of their shared history, ethnicities, and indigenous languages. One of the major ethnolinguistic groups divided by this border is the Wolof. Although Wolof continues to be an important shared language between these countries, speakers recognize divergence in the Wolof of Senegal and The Gambia. Language is often used to construct and reinforce ethnic, social, and national identity and can evoke a strong sense of solidarity or separation among speakers. As Peter Auer has argued, not only can the national border help construct a linguistic border, but the linguistic divergence can also serve to reinforce the national border. This dissertation will focus on the border in a multiethnic, multilingual area where ethnicity is strongly associated with language.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Dr. Brian Joseph, Jane Mitsch will spend eight months in the Senegambia border areas conducting sociolinguistic interviews and ethnographic fieldwork among Wolof people. This dissertation aims to examine the linguistic practices of people with shared ethnic identity but different national identity, to explore the role of the political border in the linguistic practices of these young nations, to elicit data on different identity affinities (national, ethnic, religious etc.), and to compare the linguistic results to other linguistic studies of political borders. This study will bring linguistic input to political science questions about the strength of African nations and their borders. This research will also lead to the creation of a corpus of spoken Wolof that will capture some of the important aspects of the Wolof oral tradition such as folktales and proverbs."

These are two mid-size southern cities that have experienced rapid Hispanic population increases in the last decade and dramatic changes in the local labor force's racial and ethnic composition. Although many US regions are experiencing Hispanic migration, this growth has particularly strong implications in the US South, where historically, a black-white racial binary has organized social, economic, and political interactions and large-scale voluntary in-migration has not been common. To investigate these implications, this study proceeds through two phases that together provide a broad overview of Hispanic migration to each city and more detailed case studies of this migration. First, it examines how Hispanic migration to Lexington and Nashville has developed and how Hispanics are entering local labor markets through sectors such as construction and agriculture. These initial research questions will be answered through content analyses of each city's major newspapers and public documents on Hispanic communities, analyses of recent census data, and interviews with spokespersons of local immigrant service providers. Second, the research shifts scales to local worksites that have recently become dependent on Hispanic labor. In case studies of these worksites, it addresses how the growing number of Hispanics at Lexington and Nashville worksites is affecting workplace practices and social relations. This research question will be addressed through participant observation and interviews with Hispanic workers and their non-Hispanic co-workers and supervisors concerning daily workplace practices and social interactions. The project will use data from these interviews to investigate how ethnicity and race differentiate workplace experiences for workers and supervisors and what workplace changes the increase in Hispanic labor has necessitated. Workplace comparisons will be made both within and between Nashville and Lexington, to assess the impacts of factors, such as worksite gender and ethnic integration and each city's broader management of Hispanic migration, on social interactions between and among workers and supervisors.<br/><br/>This study will make three theoretical contributions to geographical scholarship through these case studies. First, in a national context, it will provide a point of comparison for broader immigration research organized in a bi-coastal pattern that privileges large gateway cities and, thus, will reflect the changing geographies of Hispanic migration to and within the US. Second, the study will examine changes in racial identities and race relations within the US South outside the racial dualism that has long dominated such studies and at the very onset of Hispanic migration to the region. Finally, through detailed case studies of racial and ethnic interactions at Lexington and Nashville workplaces, the research will add a qualitative richness to studies of immigration to the US upper South, a part of the United States off the maps of most immigration studies but clearly visible to more and more Hispanic men and women. In addition to these theoretical contributions, this research will have broader societal impacts, particularly within Kentucky and Tennessee. It has created opportunities for collaborations, such as joint survey initiatives and database sharing, with various immigrant-service organizations. These and other partnerships will allow much broader dissemination of results, through avenues including public presentations and progress reports within each city. In this way, the Hispanic communities on which the research is based and the groups that work with them will benefit from the research in which they participated. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

The research will modify and pilot test the survey instrument used by Holtgrave and Weber in a group of white individuals with known characteristics. The results of this analysis will be used as evidence regarding the theoretical validity of this conceptualization of risk perception for white individuals, and provide a source for comparison with other ethnic and cultural groups. The research will also identify theoretically valid and reliable measures of group membership (for ethnicity, culture, and level of acculturation) to be used in the subsequent cross-cultural research. The initial research site, Los Angeles/Orange County, is optimal for cross-cultural research because there are many different ethnic and cultural groups, e.g., African-Americans, Latinos (Chicanos, recent immigrants from Mexico), Asians (Vietnamese, Cambodians, Japanese, Chinese), living in this region."

Extant research has largely overlooked this question, despite advances in our understanding of how anti-immigrant rhetoric and ethnically targeted appeals can shape the extent to which ethnicity affects Latino decisions to register or vote. This question becomes all the more compelling in light of the heterogeneity of Latino groups, in terms of both national origin and also residence in ethnic enclaves, which have divided the Latino social experience and contributed to distinctive social and political differences. <br/><br/>This project engages a range of important questions related to its central, overarching question. Does exposure to explicit and implicit cues within different frames of pro- and-anti immigrant political rhetoric increase or decrease the salience of national origin, pan-ethnic, or American group considerations in Latino vote choice? To what extent does targeted pan-immigrant versus nationality-based political appeals matter in politicizing Latino identity? Moreover, what patterns appear over time? Are framing and cue effects short-lived or do they endure? The researcher argues that the extent to which different groups of Latinos rely upon pan-ethnic group interests may depend on the content and tone of messages in the political environment. Using experimental data in New York City and Los Angeles, the project examines how Latinos across different contexts respond to explicit and implicit cues within immigrant political rhetoric and whether pan-ethnicity, as a collective form of political identity, is relevant or not in political decision-making. <br/><br/>By focusing on the political and psychological forces that incorporate or marginalize Latinos in American politics, this study tests a new conceptual framework on ethnic appeals that takes into account the fluidity and complexity of Latino group identity in the United States. This research also seeks to enrich understanding of when and how political messages in the environment increase or decrease the salience of ethnicity for immigrant-based groups. <br/><br/>The findings from this project will make several broader contributions. The project will shed light on processes of group-based mobilization of Latinos. The insights generated by this project will inform strategies designed to broaden the political participation and political incorporation of Latinos, a growing and largely underrepresented group in American politics."

The researcher will focus in particular on kin relationships and routine interactions in the family as primary sites for the co-construction of attitudes, values, and identities. In the aftermath of ethnic conflict, how do people in mixed-ethnicity families understand themselves, maintain relationships with kin, and bring up their children? <br/><br/>Research will take place over 12 months with families living in and around Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Drawing on person-centered interviews, the researcher will address how individual members of mixed-ethnicity families describe themselves, their affiliation with other people in their family and with symbols of ethnicity, and the ways that they experience or try to find a sense of belonging. She also will contextualize individuals' introspective accounts by documenting (through participant observation and video recording) spontaneous interactions between family members and by tracing the networks of care and obligation that organize family life for kinship groups that may appear ""unnatural"" and treacherous because they cross ethnic lines. When examining both personal narratives and interpersonal interactions, the researcher will attend to specific processes through which younger generations might inherit, internalize, appropriate, or transform their elders' memories of trauma and attitudes toward ethnicity, as well as broader culturally-defined ways of relating to identity and past violence. <br/><br/>Findings from this research will contribute to social scientific understanding of the effects of collective violence, particularly in terms of the intergenerational transmission of traumatic memory and attitudes of hatred or empathic understanding. This work is also relevant to the development of post-conflict reconciliation and transitional justice initiatives, including policy to support cross-cutting ties, such as mixed marriage, which can reduce the probability of further conflict.

The psychometric properties of the existing racial attitude measures for children in this age group are problematic, which has served to limit the interdisciplinary understanding of racial prejudice. One fundamental limitation of existing racial attitude measures is that all employ a two-option, forced-choice response format to measure attitudes. Forced-choice formats confound conceptually distinct phenomena, such as ingroup preference and outgroup disparagement. To disentangle this confound, the project will employ a multi-item response format. The primary objectives of this project are: (1) to establish the reliability and validity the racial attitudes instrument and (2) to assess the profiles of young children's attitudes toward Black and White racial groups. Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing (ACASI) will be the modality through which the instrument is delivered. ACASI is an innovative method that enhances data quality and data collection procedures. The racial attitudes index will employ a picture-story approach to assess children's racial attitudes. The instrument will display a set of 28 photographic images of Black and White children. The photographic images will represent children in racially mixed pairs as a voice over reads mini stories about each image. A total of 360 subjects will participate in formative and evaluative activities.<br/><br/>The results of this project will be used to construct another ACASI measure called the Interracial and Ethnic Attitudes Index (IREAX). The IREAX will be designed for five-to-nine-year-olds and will use photographic images of targets from several racial and ethnic groups (e.g., Asian, Black, Latino, Native American, and White). To date, limited research has examined attitudes across and toward multiple racial and ethnic groups. The concentrated focus on attitudes toward Black and White racial groups limits the understanding of attitudes toward other racial and ethnic groups. The data from the RAI and IREAX should advance the understanding of the contours of racial bias. Childhood is the time in which racial attitudes are most malleable. Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of children's attitudes for the development of educational and policy interventions. The aims of this study should assist in efforts to ameliorate societal tensions surrounding race and ethnicity. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

The student's proposed research project is entitled `The Influence of Intentionality, Racial and Gender Information of African-and European-American Children's Social Judgments.` The study investigates African- and European-American children's use of outcome intentionality information in dispositional and likeability judgements of black and white story characters. Prior empirical investigation suggests that there may be ethnic variations in social perception, such that the culture/ethnicity of perceivers influence their dispositional judgements. Age-related differences may exist in such influence as well. To further explore children's social judgements, this project will investigate age and ethnic variation in the influence of outcome intentionality information on children's dispositional and preference judgements. Prior research has not investigated children's judgements of female actors. Children will be presented with judgement stories about actors who intentionally almost cause a harmful outcome and actors who unintentionally almost cause a harmful outcome. Second and fifth grade children will be asked to rate actors on likeability, disposition, and cross-situational behavior. It is expected that the children's ethnicity, age, the actor's ethnicity and gender, and outcome intentionality information, will influence the children's judgements."

Three trends add weight to the crisis. First, within the next 50 years, people identified currently as ""minority"" will comprise half of the U.S. population. Second, particularly in large urban centers like New York, new waves of immigrants are arriving, ensuring fundamental, but unknown changes to the structure and dynamics of schools and other contexts. Third, the U.S. continues to evolve into a ""knowledge-driven"" economy, making a solid education vital for an increasingly large sector of the workforce. More than ever, a sizable proportion of our nation's children are at risk of academic failure and economic hardship. <br/>Faculty from multiple scientific disciplines at New York University will use NSF funding to support planning activities over a 6- to 9-month period pertaining to research that will be pursued under the proposed Center for Research on Culture, Development and Education. The central aim of the Center will be to examine how homes, schools, peers, work, and the media jointly contribute to the engagement, learning, and school performance of children from diverse cultures. <br/>Three steps are needed to accomplish this mission. First, we propose to describe the experiences of minority children within each of the educationally relevant contexts. Many social scientists focus on determining the predictors of children's academic outcomes without a deep understanding of children's everyday experiences. Such descriptive work is notably absent in research focused on ethnic minorities. We need systematic knowledge regarding how contexts such as home, peers, school, parents' work, and the media differ or are experienced differently by children from different cultures, ethnicities or social classes. Second, we seek to understand how these experiences shape children's engagement, learning and performance in school, and whether and how such connections may vary by culture, ethnicity, and social class. Third, our ultimate goal is to advance an understanding of how home, peer, school, work, and the media work together in explaining children's academic achievement. <br/>The second mission of the Center is educational: to transmit its research findings, through training and dissemination, to three communities: (1) a new generation of scholars of diverse backgrounds who are engaged in research on culture and its role in child learning, engagement, and performance; (2) the broader research community; and (3) policy makers and practitioners in education. This will occur through an intensive and rigorous training program and a variety of dissemination strategies of both research findings and lessons for policy and educational practice.<br/>The proposed Center is situated within a School of Education, in the vibrant, incomparably diverse context of New York City, making it an unparalleled locale for studying culture and schools, and an ideal place to establish a think tank capable of attracting additional scholars and students of the highest quality. Through the work of the Center, we aim to bring about a deeper understanding of the interplay of culture, development and education, and thereby enhance the nation's response to the academic underachievement of ethnic minority children."

By focusing on the case of Dalits (the former ""untouchables"") in India, this project provides an overview of the relative benefits and downsides of ""descriptive representation"" and a specific focus on the impact of the inclusion of Dalits in political institutions on attitudes toward Dalits. In contrast with prevalent theories of ""realistic conflict"" and group competition, the project argues that attitudes towards Dalits should improve in the long run with their political representation. To provide empirical evidence supporting this claim, the study uses survey-experiments and other attitudinal variables measuring attitudes towards Dalits in a survey of Southern Indian villages. Empirically, the project has two objectives: measure the extent to which Dalit representation has affected attitudes towards Dalits and investigate the causal mechanisms that lie behind any changes. Since villages in which political offices are specifically set aside for Dalits are randomly chosen according to the ""reservation"" system in place since 1993, survey answers allow clearer causal estimates of the impact of Dalit political inclusion on attitudes.<br/><br/>The project makes several contributions. Scholars have devoted surprisingly little attention to the attitudinal repercussions of a change in the ethnicity of political leaders. This question appears crucial in regards to the prevalent view in political science, according to which ethnic groups fight for the control of economic and political resources. Following this hypothesis, a deterioration of interethnic relations would likely offset the material gains a group derives from political representation. To address this question, the proposal uses experimental designs employed by political psychologists interested in racial attitudes in the United States. The project thus strives to circumvent social desirability effects among respondents and proposes a rare comparative test of some of the questions the American literature on group attitudes has been debating for the last three decades.<br/><br/>This project has broader impacts from informing at least two major, public policy-related debates. The first concerns the relative benefits of increasing the participation of citizens from disadvantaged groups in policy-making processes. While this consensual prescription is widely accepted, very little evidence currently exists concerning the overall benefits this would bring to the targeted community. This project also informs the debate over the value and the benefits of ""positive discriminations."" Arguments over the negative impact on intergroup relations of positive discriminations, such as ""political reservations,"" have been developing fast in India, in France and in the United States. This will also yield relevant findings on this question. While the project focuses on the impact of descriptive representation on these attitudes, other scholars interested in racial/ethnic attitudes may subsequently use this original data to test a variety of hypotheses related to the environmental determinants of intergroup attitudes."

The research is informed by two basic stylized facts that characterize internal conflict in developing societies. First, economics matters. Conflicts have strong associations with economic variables such as per-capita income and natural resource revenues. Second, classical ""class conflicts"" --- or conflict demarcated along economic lines --- are rare: warring groups are often delineated by noneconomic markers such as ethnicity, caste, geography or religion.<br/><br/>This project takes these facts as points of departure. A central question concerns the coexistence of economic motives and noneconomic group markers. Noneconomic markers can be used to exclude certain groups from economic progress. Indeed, the more (economically) similar the warring groups, the more such a strategy is likely to be used. Accordingly, the first part of this project constructs a theory of ""group formation"" in conflict, the idea being that existing social markers (such as religion) can be used to create ""insiders"" and ""outsiders"" in a variety of ways. In a world in which all sorts of sidepayments can costlessly be made, each potential conflict can, in principle, because all conflict destroys resources. However, with a multiplicity of ethnic markers, any one of which may be invoked, it may be impossible to deal with every potential threat at the same historical moment of time. It will be argued that postwar institutions, such as progressive taxation or land reform, have evolved well to deal with the specter of class conflict, but have left the door open for threats from other noneconomic markers.<br/><br/>The second part of the project applies these ideas to an empirical study of Hindu-Muslim violence in India. If one side is socially and politically more able to use violence for economic ends, then an increase in the victim group's income should have a positive impact on conflict, while an increase in the aggressor group's income should have an insignificant effect. This sort of prediction can be tested, and the project proposes to do so. Using National Sample survey data along with a unique dataset on Hindu-Muslim conflict, preliminary results indicate that Muslim incomes are positively associated with future conflict, while Hindu incomes have no such effect. The project will build on this foundation by using additional data sources and running several different robustness checks.<br/><br/>The third part of the project develops a theoretical model, and establishes a structural connection between conflict and well-known indices of social distribution such as inequality, fractionalization and polarization. It is shown that three particular indices determine conflict, and the relative weights on them reveal the underlying values of structural parameters in the economy.<br/><br/>The PI also plans a full-length book manuscript on the Economics of Social Conflict. Certainly, the results from this project will form an important part of the book, but the intention is to put together, in a cohesive way, a large literature from economics, political science and sociology on the topic of conflict in developing countries.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: this project uses economic theory to develop testable predictions that reach beyond economic boundaries. For instance, the predicted juxtaposition of noneconomic group markers with the possibility of economic gains from conflict is a central theme. Likewise, the second part of this project, which discerns aggressor identity from economic data, exemplifies the attempt to go beyond economic boundaries. IPolitical scientists, sociologists and ethnographers will find this useful and complementary to their own work. The theory in part 3 generates a estimable relationship between conflict and various distributional indicators which will inform future empirical research in the area.<br/><br/>Finally, from a broader social and economic perspective, the questions asked under this project are of first-order importance. Does economic growth stifle conflict, or might it exacerbate it? What is the relationship between inequality and conflict? Why might class conflict give way to ethnic conflict? Does ethnic conflict stem from some primordial hatred and mistrust, or is it carefully engineered? If so, how precisely might one write down a theory of conflict that does not presume that participants are plain irrational? While the project is firmly grounded in the logic of economic reasoning, these questions go beyond economics."

Focusing on the wider implications of cultural attributions of responsibility, the research investigates the different cultural and religious logics used to recognize and assign agency in order to ascertain how these differences impact peoples' perceptions and performances of ethnicity. <br/><br/>The research employs social science methods to analyze rituals, narratives, and conversations and to investigate how members from distinct ethnic and religious backgrounds variably communicate and explain misfortune. The project seeks to grasp how diverse ways of attributing responsibility for misfortune and describing the agency of humans, spirits, and ritual objects impact the construction of seemingly objective differences between ethnic communities. The researcher will record and analyze how people talk about misfortune and describe responsibility in different social settings: (1) at a Hindu Surinamese oracle and temple, (2) at an Afro-Surinamese Shrine and church, and (3) in everyday talk in both communities. The research also comparatively records and analyzes narratives of the Surinamese civil war to discern the impact of cultural and religious logics of explanation on the interpretation of this national crisis. <br/><br/>The research will contribute to a clearer understanding of how people in contemporary multi-ethnic societies create and understand ethnic and religious differences, while observing the implication of such concepts for the practices of all areas of social life, from politics to the market. By explaining how responsibility and misfortune are attributed and transformed in a society simultaneously culturally hybrid and socially segregated, the research will provide an incisive analysis of human social and cultural difference. The project will also contribute to the training of a social scientist."

During this period Latinos have eclipsed African Americans as the single largest ethnic minority group in the country and they have increasingly settled in large numbers outside of traditional gateway cities in the west and northeast. The percentage of African Americans in the country has not increased nearly as fast but it continues to grow as a share of the overall population and as a share of registered voters. <br/><br/>In light of the changing racial and ethnic landscape, this study will address the prospects for inter-group conflict or cooperation in the new century. The investigators are particularly interested in the ways that co-ethnic political elites and interest group leaders can shape the attitudes that African Americans, Latinos, and Whites have about one another. The study will address whether statements by group leaders that are reported in the mass media can inflame or diminish inter-group hostility. For example, are Whites more likely to bring their racial identity to bear on their policy preferences if political leaders provide them with a license to do so? Are similar appeals also effective for African Americans and Latinos? Additionally, the study will explore whether appeals of this sort are more effective when delivered with indirect or coded language, rather than more explicit appeals and whether political appeals designed to cleave the electorate along racial lines are more effective in the American south. <br/><br/>Two distinct experiments will be embedded in a nationally representative Internet survey to test hypotheses about group conflict. The study will test, and potentially modify, a number of theories concerning racial attitudes and identity politics in the fields of political science, sociology, social psychology, and communication studies. This work will explore the contingent nature of racial and ethnic identities and seek to identify the circumstances in which they can be brought to bear on policy preferences and other political decisions. <br/><br/>This research also has implications beyond advancing the social science literature. With the inauguration of Barack Obama as the nation's 44th President, many political observers predicted that the country would enter a new, ""post-racial,"" era. However, it may be the case that Obama's victory, coupled with the demographic changes outlined above, will make race and ethnicity more salient in the future. It is also possible that some political figures will have an incentive to capitalize on lingering racial fears and resentments. If scholars can generate an improved understanding of the possibilities and limitations of these appeals, then society will be better equipped to combat divisive racial rhetoric."

Compared to other industrialized, high per capita income countries, this is one of the highest proportions of foreign labor in the world. This enormous change has accompanied by large waves of Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia, which has greatly impacted the ethnic and linguistic spectrum of Israel. At the same time, Israeli policy-makers have been limiting work permits for Palestinian workers from the Occupied Territories, as part of Israeli government strategies to constitute the borders that separate the Israeli state and the as-yet-unrealized Palestinian state. These changes affect how the Israeli state attempts to constitute citizens as members of a Jewish nation, and how emerging ethnic groups respond.<br/>This dissertation research by a doctoral student of both sociocultural anthropology and linguistics studies how Latin American foreign workers, or Latinos, are transformed in terms of the ethnic and linguistic ideologies dominant in Israel. Generally, the cultural and linguistic production of migrant workers has been analyzed by social scientists as ""hybrid,"" a term which privileges the perspective of nation-states which promote homogeneous citizenries. Instead of assuming such a perspective, this project considers how Latinos come to objectify and differentiate ethnic and linguistic varieties in Israel, and how they then come to understand themselves as different in terms of that variation. Crucially, the ethnolinguistic understanding of Latinos is mediated by emergent language ideologies, i.e., how actors conceive of the relation between language, social groups, and their social world. To chart these ideologies and language use among Latinos, research methods include participant observation and recording in homes, in Latino social organizations (like churches or soccer leagues), and in schools and after-school programs for Latino children. This study will contribute to theories of language acquisition and contact, language ideologies, ethnicity and nationhood, and migration and state.<br/> The broader impact of this study is that it will advance our understanding of transnational labor migration and its effect on workers, a topic of broad interest to policy makers in both receiving and sending countries."

It focuses on the populations of the Moldovan regions of Gagauzia and Transnistria, an area of strategic importance whose conflict has witnessed involvement by Europe and Russia. Increasing our understanding of how identity links to conflict situations has serious implications for the development of democracy and stable societies.<br/><br/>This research will produce several important intellectual contributions related to identity and its consequences. Linguistic identity influences an individual's political proclivities because it may limit the ability to join certain identity groups: learning a new language is difficult, while developing native-level fluency is often impossible for adults. As a result, an individual's linguistic knowledge can permanently mark the individual as either belonging or not belonging to certain groups. Under some conditions, individuals who lack the necessary linguistic abilities for group membership may attempt to better their situation by raising the status of a group to which they belong, or by creating a state in which this group will be protected.<br/><br/>Though language is often conflated with ethnicity, the two Moldovan cases indicate that linguistic and ethnic identities can operate independently in relation to separatist mobilization; the cases thus serve as ideal laboratories for assessing the relationship between language and political behavior. The project uses a unique survey instrument to investigate the role of linguistic identity in these two regions. By analyzing the relationship between different forms of identity and perceptions of discrimination and life-opportunities, this project will determine whether or not language is actually perceived to block upward mobility in a society. By assessing the impact of different forms of linguistic identity (i.e. identification vs. proficiency) in relation to support for separatism and mobilization, it will investigate how this identity can motivate willingness to mobilize and provides a new avenue for research on identity-based conflict.<br/><br/>The project also features important broader impacts. As ethnic conflicts remain widespread, it is imperative to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms by which such conflicts arise. Furthermore, separatism in Moldova is itself important: as recent territorial struggles in the Republic of Georgia proved, post-Soviet territorial conflicts can have worldwide repercussions. The research will enhance our understanding of conflict processes, an essential part of informing foreign policy decision-making."

What accounts for the upward mobility of a significant minority of second generation Ticuanense men and women, and the stagnation or even downward mobility of the rest? Why do some second generation Mexican-Americans view ethnic and racial discrimination as not stopping them from achieving in school or work, view themselves more as ""second generation ethnics"" and identify more with ""ethnic"" immigrants (like Greeks or Italians), while others see discrimination as precluding their mobility, view themselves as ""native racial minorities"" and identify more with Blacks and Puerto Ricans. What relationship, if any, do their views of discrimination have to their occupational and educational mobility? This project is supported under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions program.

New mining, timber, and conservation development pressures are the basis for multiple legal and political actions of Amerindian organizations. In contrast to unified federations and ethnic based politics, however, the panoply of resource conflicts in Guyana has not catalyzed political unity among Amerindians thus far. The richness in this movement's diversification provokes a reconsideration of important meta-questions in debates of human and environmental change: What is the relationship between land and ethnicity? How do histories of environmental uncertainty affect the modes of social movements? What is the connection between environmental changes and political space that restricts ethnic discourses? Has the practice of development and conservation become more accountable to indigenous communities? In pursuit of the idea that different community histories of economic security and resource access since liberalization are the primary variables affecting political activity and organization, fieldwork will be conducted in the capital of Georgetown and two Amerindian regions in the interior. A blend of qualitative research methods drawing on archival documents, interviews, participant observation, and legal case analysis will be employed. The research findings will illuminate complex community associations that intersect contours of ethnic boundaries within the Amerindian movement of Guyana, perhaps reflecting more critical alliances based on specific histories of ecological change and economic security. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation research will engage a variety of literature, including studies in political ecology, accountability in international development, the political economy of the Caribbean, and social movements of indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups.

The research will reveal some general constraints and opportunities of alternative indigenous political strategies and approaches to survival, potentially illuminating unusual tactics for engaging the development-conservation nexus. It will also be a challenging discourse to dominant resource management agencies, international NGOs, and development institutions. As such, this research on the context of Amerindian politics in Guyana will also inform other marginal groups experiencing similar ecological, social, and economic marginalization in other countries.

In the Northwest Amazon of Brazil, indigenous urbanization has been accompanied by a different kind of language shift, in which the many different indigenous languages of the region as a whole are reduced to just two or three which, along with Portuguese are spoken in the urban public sphere. To understand this rather different kind of language shift - here a shift between different indigenous languages - it helps to know that linguistic differences are the primary markers of ethnic differences in the region. Linguistic exogamy, where marriage occurs only between speakers of different languages, is the characteristic social institution of the Northwest Amazon, and ensures that multilingualism was (and still is) the status quo in the region. Using the ethnographic literature on the region as a comparative basis, this dissertation research project by a cultural anthropologist examines the social, spatial and linguistic organization of urban indigenous communities in terms of these related ideologies of language and ethnicity as they are united in the marital practices of urban immigrants. The research will be focused on three indigenous neighborhoods of Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, and will involve participant observation, focused interviews, digital video records of interactions, and a survey of residence and marriage patterns. <br/> The project serves as a good case study to counter unidirectional understandings of the ""acculturation"" of indigenous peoples seen to occur through institutionalized contact with the nation-state, integration into capitalist networks and urbanization. Such processes, as they appear across the globe, are often thought to have their necessary endpoint in a monolingual speech community that divides the nation-state and its citizenry from the indigenous population, if at all, by a ""race"" based understanding of ethnicity. In the indigenous urban centers of the Northwest Amazon these three elements - nationstates, capitalism and urbanization - are all in play and yet multilingualism still thrives, as does a vision of ethnicity linked to language.

It examines the ways ethnic and national identities have been mutually constructed during the islands' twentieth century experience of continued colonial status, an economic boom fostered by tourism, and a concomitant increase in migration from other Caribbean islands. British Virgin Island national identity has been precariously defined against migrants from independent Caribbean nations who come to work there (who currently make up almost half of the islands' population), the islands' relationship to the UK, and the tourists British Virgin Islander businesses hope to attract. Unlike earlier research which took ethnic and national identities as ""givens"" and attempted to explain their interactions in terms of ""adaptation"" resulting from competition over scarce ""resources,"" this study follows leads from recent work on India which questions the premises of adaptationist approaches. Using court cases, records, and interviews, the study will contest the definition of ""resources"" and ""competition"" as self-evident, and test the proposition that ""resources"" themselves are historically constructed along with legal and cultural processes of national and ethnic identity formation. This research will add to anthropological theory on nationalism, ethnicity and law."

It has a methodological component, focusing on a difficult issue of measurement. Analysts of race and ethnicity use data that generally code racial and ethnic categories on the basis of respondent self identification. However, self identification of race and ethnicity is often inconsistent with the way persons are socially classified. Therefore data based on respondent self identification may be inappropriate for measuring racial inequality or discrimination. Differences between these forms of racial classification are noteworthy in the case of Brazil. Comparisons of racial self identification with racial social identification in Brazil are possible for the first time due to data collected in a recent national survey. Using these data, this research project will examine how Brazilians self-identify by race and how this may deviate from their socially ascribed race. The research will also study the determinants of racial self identification and the consequences of using self identification for estimating racial inequality. This phase of the work addresses six chief questions: (1) the extent to which self identification of race deviates from interviewer (or social) identification of race using census racial categories, (2) the extent to which there is a preference for ambiguous racial categories, (3) the extent to which there is a preference for the Afro-Brazilian identity affirmation category, (4) the impact of class and racial reference group variables, (5) influences of modernization and urbanization variables, and (6) whether social identification leads to estimates of racial inequality, and particularly income inequality, that are different from those based on self identification. Results from this study will contribute to the scientific literature on theories of racial and ethnic identification, changing conceptions of race in Brazil, and racial inequality in Brazil. Studying the scientific questions in a social environment ve ry different from that of the United States will provide a useful comparison that can help guide public responses to issues of race and ethnicity in America."

Previous research revealed that in this setting ethnically Sukuma children were significantly heavier and taller for their age than were age and sex matched ethnically Pimbwe children. Contrary to initial predictions, measures of household food insecurity during the pre-harvest hunger season, indicators of household wealth, and maternal stature were generally unable to account for the large differences between these ethnic groups. In this research, the investigator will explore in more detail the relative impact of dietary intake and maternal care giving behaviors on children's nutritional status and mortality. Methods of data collection include focus groups, recipe trials, a survey, and anthropometry. The objective is to identify key differences in patterns of childcare between these two groups, as well as to gain a better understanding of why the two groups differ in their ability to care for their children. The research will contribute to theoretical debates in both cultural and biological anthropology about the relationship between subsistence and demographic outcomes, as well as the influence of culture and ethnicity on children's health. <br/><br/>Broader impacts<br/>New knowledge of why women so rarely adhere to current international nutrition recommendations for infant and child feeding will be relevant to international and local health planners.

A major reason for the absence of data is the difficulty in systematically surveying a small, bicoastally-distributed, and ethnically and linguistically diverse population. However, the regionally-concentrated and highly metropolitan residential pattern of the population also permits opportunity to selectively sample Asian Americans from localities where they are most likely to congregate. Telephone households in the top metropolitan areas of Asian populations in the United States will be sampled using a multi-frame approach consisting of unrestricted random-digit dialing Asian exchange density, random-digit dialing at targeted Asian exchange density, and listed-surname frames. A total of 1,000 adult Asians belonging to the six largest Asian ethnic groups and residing in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Honolulu, and Chicago will be interviewed by phone, with 200 completed interviews from each of the five locations. <br/><br/>An initiative to gather primary data on the political attitudes and behavior of Asian Americans is direly needed to bridge the research and data gaps in the studying of American political behavior and the state of the U.S. democracy as a multicultural society. Although large-scale, nationally representative public opinion data have been collected specifically from the African and Hispanic American population, no such data exist for the studying of the political opinion of the nation's third largest and fastest growing minority population. Without such data, it is difficult to gauge the shape of the Asian American political community at the national level. Neither is it possible to advance our understanding of the sources of uneven incorporation of this minority population into the U.S. economic and political systems. Information gathered from this initiative would represent a significant expansion in hypothesis testing concerning race and political behavior as well as of research coverage to geographic locations and American ethnic groups neglected in the extant literature. <br/><br/>This research is an integral part of the investigator's career plans and goals to advance the scholarship, visibility, and influence of Asian Americans--particularly Asian immigrant women--in Political Science and Ethnic Studies. Data and experience gained from this pilot study will be evaluated and used to secure research partnership and major foundation support for the conducting of a larger and more comprehensive multiracial survey to address the nation's issues of inequality in social and political participation and incorporation. This ultimately will contribute to the larger goal of promoting equal opportunities in social and political participation regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and nativity through rigorous social science research and cross-disciplinary intellectual exchange. In these ways, an award from POWRE is critical not only to the advancement of the investigator's career at this juncture, but to the expansion of knowledge and understanding about Asian Americans as a political community and about America as a multicultural democracy."

It is part of a larger research effort to understand the relation between poverty and ethnicity in this region. The larger project includes a nationally representative survey fielded in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Slovakia. The survey is designed to provide estimates of the extent of poverty, and also to assess whether certain ethnic groups, and in particular, the Roma (Gypsies), are likely to be concentrated in poverty. Many researchers suspect that an underclass is forming among the Roma in this region as a result of the recent transition to a market economy. Although a survey is crucial, it reveals little about the temporal processes that create an underclass or that produce waves of assimilation and dissimilation<br/><br/>This project, the historical component of the research, addresses this omission by studying the long-term processes of underclass formation, assimilation and dissimilation by linking them to economic systems of capitalism and socialism and to assimilationist policies. Specifically, this project complements the quantitative (survey) methodology with community studies, using in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical, archival research. This research will contribute to the sociological literature on the underclass and assimilation through its examination of these theoretical constructs outside the American context in which they are usually studied. Research on the underclass in usually linked to African-Americans living in urban ghettos. In contrast, this project considers whether an underclass exists among rural Roma in Central Europe. Similarly, much research on assimilation focuses on the unidirectional process of immigrant assimilation in the United States. Again, in contrast, this current project considers the waves of assimilation and dissimilation of non-immigrant ethnic minorities in a cross-national context."

Ms. Evans-Pritchard's study applies the theoretical, methodological, and empirical insights that have been gained in this arena as well as the perspectives and concerns of folkloric research to a study of how the American legal system goes about maintaining what it considers to be ethnic traditions--the way arguments and definitions are formed and the way that the matter of ethnic values and traditions are made justifiable in a multi-ethnic society. Through her doctoral dissertation research under the direction of Drs. Jones and Georges, she plans to examine the conceptualizations of tradition that emerge from the judicial process and the relationship such conceptualizations have to ethnographic reality. Specifically, Ms. Evans-Pritchard focuses on the ""Portal Case,"" a highly controversial lawsuit in which an Anglo craftsman challenged the Indian-only policy of Santa Fe's traditional Indian market. She compares the Portal Case with five recent court cases in various parts of the country which have involved similar issues of tradition and ethnic or cultural boundaries in order to operationalize the process by which the formal legal apparatus is currently handling the informal social force of tradition. A key element of her work is to establish the ethnographic context of three related New Mexico cases, including the Portal Case, involving Native American arts and crafts in order to illuminate the relationship between the codified conceptualizations of tradition expressed in the court proceedings and the imbedded views of tradition held by the affected Native American craftsmen. Through systematic, comparative analysis of diverse sources of data, this project holds substantial promise of advancing our understanding of how courts and litigants construct boundaries around cultural or ethnic groups."

Three broad questions serve as central organizing themes for research: (1) How is human behavior at household and community levels linked to regional and global change phenomena? (2) How can macro-scale physical processes observed and modeled at a global level be linked to meso and micro human organizational and decision-making processes? (3) How do institutional arrangements influence the direction and size of the impact of human driving forces, such as population and transportation networks, on forest ecosystems and global change? These broad, overarching questions are addressed by specific projects that combine the efforts of social scientists, ecologists, and physical scientists working together on sustained, over-time research conducted in carefully selected sites using the best methods from the physical, biological, and the social sciences. The Center draws on expertise from four existing Indiana University centers: The Anthropological Center for Training and Research on Global Environmental Change (ACT), the Workshop in Political Theory and Analysis, the Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Global Environmental Change (NIGEC), and the Population Institute for Research and Training (PIRT). CIPEC also addresses the national need of training doctoral-level environmental social scientists in rigorous disciplinary methods and the development of interdisciplinary skills. The Center has an international commitment to the training of mid-career scholars and professionals from a number of countries in recognition of the global nature of environmental change. CIPEC will produce new discoveries and new knowledge that will both expand our understanding of the human dimensions of global change and influence the direction of research in the larger HDGC community. In addition, CIPEC will foster both interdisciplinary research and multidisciplinary training in the human dimensions of global change."

The web component is being augmented by multi-media tools developed at UCLA that allow the visualization of virtual neighborhoods, as well as easy access to text, pictures, and video images to illustrate a variety of important sociological concepts and themes. These virtual neighborhoods make it possible to incorporate 3-D animation with realistic environments creating an interactive urban context composed of representative buildings, landmarks, and neighborhoods of the geographic area. The current neighborhood is simulated, and then it is recreated for several earlier periods.

Students and others can use these materials to examine and understand the dramatic changes in population, race, ethnic ancestry, family status, housing and living conditions, and income and wealth that have occurred in these two major metropolises. Related exercises that are being developed allow students to compare and contrast the growth of the two regions, to explore the changing patterns of economic and ethnic inequality, and to study the immigration history of New York and Los Angeles and the migration paths of recent immigrant groups in the cities and the suburbs. Other exercises are focusing on occupational structure, educational systems, social welfare, riots, and the location and situation of those in the artistic fields in the two regions. (We are also exploring how to generalize these tools to other locales.) <br/>The materials are being pilot tested at the PI's home campuses and in courses at a variety of other colleges and universities in the United States.

Comparatively less work has evaluated the migration processes associated with changes in race and space within the metropolitan area. The more careful studies that have examined the race migration dynamic have tended to follow an old paradigm that focused primarily on white and black suburban migration, examined on the basis of a simple two-category city-suburb dichotomy of metropolitan space. The proposed research is a study of minority migration within metropolitan areas that goes beyond the black-white, city-suburb typology. It utilizes detailed Census 2000 migration data. This study recognizes two developments. First, immigration and the recent foreign-born population have increased significantly over the past two decades, creating a broader mix of race and ethnic minorities. Their movement, both into and within the metropolitan area, requires a new understanding of race-based migration dynamics of the central city and within the suburbs. The second development involves the increased diversity of communities that exist within the broad category of suburbs, rendering the latter term less meaningful as a characterization of a homogenous set of lifestyles and demographic attributes such as race. The proliferation of suburban employment centers, inner suburbs with characteristics similar to central cities, low density residential settlements, and, increasing inter-suburb commuting calls for an extended geographic framework for the analysis of city and intra-suburban race ethnic migration. Using a comparative metropolitan framework based on the 20 largest metropolitan areas, this research will show how race and ethnic immigrant/native migration processes vary across classes of suburban communities and central cities and how they are shaped by these areas and their metropolitan areas' socio-demographic and structural features. <br/><br/>This study will shed new light on old issues such as race-selective flight, city and inner suburb decline, employment-residence mismatches, and segregation across communities. It is also relevant to current policy issues associated with minority-majority disparities between inner and outer suburbs linked to differential tax bases, access to resources, such as transportation and education, and the emerging digital divide within metropolitan areas which are seen to be exacerbated by expanding suburban sprawl and its emerging political implications."

The project has two components, one examining differences in the production of African American and European American speech and the other examining differences in their perception - i.e., how listeners distinguish the two. Past research on African American English has focused largely on grammatical variants (such as copula deletion: ""He happy""; and habitual BE: ""He be working""), and consonantal variants (such as R-lessness: HEAH for HERE; and consonant cluster simplification: PAS for PAST). Research on vocalic and intonational variation in African American English has been scarce, and research on variation in rhythm and voice quality even rarer. This project will examine these lesser-known variables. The production component will include acoustic analyses of recordings of African Americans and European Americans from the same communities in North Carolina, examining vowel, intonational, rhythm, and voice quality variables. The perception component will include a series of speech identification experiments in which the effects on ethnic identification of the variables investigated in the production component are compared.<br/><br/>It is important to study variables involving vowels, intonation, rhythm, and voice quality because they are the factors that give speakers accents and thus are critical for African American and European American identity. These variables are likely to appear in running speech before the better-studied grammatical variables and usually before the consonantal variables. Unlike those variables, variables involving vowels, intonation, rhythm, and voice quality seem to persist in standard African American speech. African Americans can use them to project their ethnic identity even in situations in which they have to avoid the more stigmatized grammatical and consonantal variants. In situations such as telephone conversations and radio broadcasts, listeners can distinguish a speaker's ethnicity using these variables. This ability is involved in both racial profiling and discrimination. More information about these variables, including their distribution within the two ethnic groups and how they are used by listeners, can provide insights as to how racial profiling occurs. This information could be useful in legal cases."

Through in-depth ethnographic participant observation, semi-structured interviews with a sample of about 100 individuals, and a survey of about 100 individuals in each site, the student will study how transnational connections lead to resources useful to the refugees, and how their self-identity as Khmer assists and obstructs their access to valuable resources in their adopted US homeland. This research is important because it will lead to advances in our understanding of how refugee communities use their existing ties with their homeland and their self-defined and other-defined identities as ethnic populations to adjust to their immigrant situations. This sort of understanding is increasingly more important as migration grows in volume and as the conception of a `melting pot` where ethnic differences are blended into a new homogenous US identity give way to an ideal of a democratic civil society composed of mutually cooperating distinctive groups."

The goal of the study is to discern how such choices are influenced by social context. The team is examining both the immediate within-school contexts of students' friendship groups, associations with academic peers, and exposure to rigorous academic curricula, as well as the broader social context across schools, characterized by a school's social and academic, the math and science curriculum available and courses offered, and socio-economic aspects of the communities within which the schools are embedded. They pay special attention to how these processes differ for key population subgroups, including students of different race and ethnicity, social class, and immigrant generational status.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the study is based largely in the strength of<br/>(1) the acknowledgement that the science and math trajectories of female and male students throughout high school and college are complex and multi-faceted, and do not necessarily follow one major pattern,<br/>(2) the conceptualization, that the social contexts within and across schools influence the choices and performance of female and male students,<br/>(3) the recognition that the trajectories and the social mechanisms that influence them may be different for subgroups of diverse students (i.e. racial and ethnic, socioeconomic, and immigrant population subgroups) and<br/>(4) the analytic approach that applies rigorous research methodology to analysis of a major new large and nationally representative data set that is well designed to measure the multiple social contexts of the conceptual framework.<br/><br/>First, the design of the study highlights the various science and math trajectories actually traveled by female and male students across multiple time points and transitions, rather than assuming an apriori or singular path. Further, the premise of social context influencing girls' science and math attainment has previously been applied to studies of gender differences in science and math primarily in small-scale or qualitative studies, or in contrast, in very broad treatments of national or international trends. The study builds on this literature by suggesting a framework of female students' choices and performance occurring within the constraints of an opportunity structure, one that includes both the immediate social context within schools, as well as the broader social context of schools and communities themselves. Additionally, the study's merit derives from consideration of the complexities of gendered experiences, by examining how the science and math trajectories taken, and the influence of the social context on such pathways, may be different for girls from different race and ethnic groups, social classes, and immigrant generational status. Finally, the merit of the study also stems from the use of new and nationally-representative data on schools and students (the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement (AHAA) component of the Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)), which allows the examination of the effects of contextual factors on gendered choices within and across schools for the first time, as well as the use of advanced statistical techniques such as hierarchical linear modeling, and the consideration of academic trajectories in additional subjects to provide a contrast to the study of science and math.<br/><br/>Broader Impact. First, while there have been a large number of studies examining gendered differences in math and science areas, the consideration of the social context within and across schools adds to the general understanding of the problem by focusing on how both immediate and broad contexts function to provide information and encouragement about gendered norms and opportunities that subsequently influence the performance and the choices girls make in the traditionally male-dominated fields of science and math. Additionally by investigating which characteristics of schools and the course curriculum encourage girls to choose math and science courses and further programs of study, the study can offer evidence of how schools can play an active role in promoting gender equality. By highlighting how schools vary in the extent to which girls are represented in advanced math and science courses in high school, the team hopes to dispel the notion that the gender gap is a constant and unyielding phenomenon, characterized by girls' failure to meet the same levels of their male peers. Finally, the use of high quality nationally representative data with a large sample size allows the investigation of racial and ethnic, social class, and immigrant subgroups differences in the effects of context. This is extremely important for understanding how these social mechanisms may operate differently within various subpopulations, and consequently, how to better design policies that promote gender equity."

As part of ECR, this project is funded by the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering (GSE) program. GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. Over the past two decades, social science research has found that girls and women encounter barriers in STEM education and then face additional obstacles entering and advancing in STEM careers. Yet, the effects of motherhood and fatherhood on the careers of STEM professionals are not well studied. This research will explore whether parenting--especially motherhood--incurs penalties in STEM employment in terms of retention, advancement, and salary. Using a sociological theoretical perspective that socially structured life courses move through gendered institutions, the study will examine how parenthood shapes career trajectories, retention, and salaries for women and men in STEM fields. The proposed empirical research project will use representative, longitudinal data to analyze these parenthood effects among STEM professionals. The researchers will also investigate how these parenthood effects differ by race/ethnicity, education level, sector, and STEM field. The findings will inform theory about gender differences in retention across all career stages and efforts to develop interventions that improve women's long-term persistence and success in STEM.<br/><br/>This project will use nationally representative, longitudinal, restricted-use data of STEM professionals from the Nation Center for Science and Engineering's (NCSES) Science and Engineering Statistical Data System (SESTAT) to examine the effects of parenthood on career paths and pay. The sample (N=17,599) includes STEM professionals employed full-time in 2003 and followed through 2010. Through a series of bi- and multivariate statistical analyses, the researchers will address the following research questions: Who leaves full-time STEM employment after becoming a parent? Where do they go? How do these parenthood effects vary by gender, race/ethnicity, education level, sector, and STEM field? Is the cost in lost income of making a career change higher if respondents made the change for family reasons compared to other reasons? Among workers who remain in full-time STEM careers, how do gender, parenthood, education level, and race/ethnicity affect salary? Since a large majority of workers become parents at some point during their careers, understanding the gendered effects of parenthood on the careers of STEM practitioners is central to understanding the retention of talented women and men in these fields. The researchers will also look for systematic variation by race/ethnicity, education level, sector and STEM field."

The research is grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory, which explains the interaction among personal, environmental, and behavioral variables in the development of career interests, choices, and persistence. Using a sample of engineering students at New Mexico State University (NMSU), a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), the PIs hypothesize that the SCCT model will explain significant variance in students? academic satisfaction and persistence in engineering. In addition, the researchers will test for group invariance of the SCCT model to assess the generalizability in the model based on gender and race/ethnicity. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to examine the hypothesized SCCT model (both cross-sectionally and longitudinally), and a series of multi-group analyses using SEM will be used to test for group invariance. Finally, the PIs will conduct interviews with Latino/a non-persisters in engineering to examine the salient factors in their decision to leave engineering. The proposed study is a collaboration between the University of Missouri (MU) and NMSU.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Findings from this study will contribute knowledge regarding the cultural validity of SCCT, a theory used to inform educational and career interventions across a variety of majors and professional fields. The findings may lead to theoretical refinements of SCCT with Latino/as as well as new theory development in explaining educational persistence and job satisfaction of Latino/as and White women in engineering. The findings from this project will be disseminated broadly so that educators and practitioners can design and develop effective programs that will enhance social cognitions related to the selection of, persistence in, and satisfaction in engineering among White women and Latino/as. The results will offer information regarding the generalizability of the SCCT model across gender and racial/ethnic groups by illustrating how the relations within this model are distinct or similar across Latinas, White women, Latinos, and White men. Interventions and activities may be tailored for each group to bolster the social cognitions that are the strongest predictors for each group. The findings may also be used to provide supports that can be implemented during strategic points in these students? educational training when they may be at higher risk for dropping out of engineering. Early identification of students at risk of dropping out enables the development of retention strategies to minimize attrition in engineering. Finally, the project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including women students and students of color, in developing expertise in theoretically-driven research and in understanding the career development of women and Latino/as in engineering."

Given the large number of cases (nearly 90,000 local governments) and considerable institutional and contextual variation across and within local governments, one might assume that the study of US local elections is an area of substantial scholarly investigation. And yet this is a relatively unexplored area of inquiry. The absence of scholarly research on local elections is significant, since 96% of the nearly half million elected officials in the US represent local rather than state or federal jurisdictions, and since municipalities have the largest share of elected officials, with 27% (US Census Bureau 1995). <br/><br/>The Local Elections in America Project (LEAP) will accomplish two goals. First, it offers a path-breaking methodology to create a centralized, comprehensive, and cost effective local elections database that will provide unparalleled opportunities for learning about local elections and the political, racial and socio-demographic features of American cities. The software application will systematically collect, digitize, and disseminate data on city council and mayoral elections, employing an automated system that will continue to collect elections data long into the future without ongoing external funding. Moreover, the application will be highly flexible and could therefore be adapted to handle different types of elections (e.g., school board or judicial contests) or units of analysis (precincts). <br/><br/>The second goal of this project is to use the LEAP database as the foundation for research that focuses on the centrality of race/ethnicity in local electoral politics. The increasing racial/ethnic heterogeneity of the US population is nowhere more evident than at the local level, which means that local elections provide the best arena for testing a whole range of theories. This component of the project focuses on the emergence and political ambition of minority candidates in American politics and the role of candidate and voter race/ethnicity in the process and outcome of American elections. To date almost no studies have examined the conditions under which minority candidates run for office and there is little in the way of theory to guide understanding of the ""supply side"" of minority representation. Is the lack of minority representation in elective office due to the defeat of the minority candidate or the absence of minority candidates? No study has even ventured a guess at this question. Other specific questions this project will address include: Under what conditions do African Americans and Latinos decide to run for local office, and how is their ""path to office"" different than that of their white counterparts? And, once the minority candidates are victorious, what is the trajectory of their political careers? How does candidate race/ethnicity shape the competitiveness of municipal elections (including primaries)? <br/><br/>LEAP represents an unprecedented advancement in the areas of data collection and dissemination. The project creates the much needed infrastructure to describe systematically, as never before, the landscape of local politics and elections, to test empirically an unprecedented range of social science theories that have heretofore been little studied in the context of local politics, and to establish an automated and ongoing process of data collection. The database will provide a crucial corollary to current databases and open up local elections to scholars outside of urban politics. Making the LEAP data available via an interactive website will maximize access and use for social scientists, educators, and stakeholder groups.<br/><br/>This award was partially funded by the Office of Cyberinfrastructure (OCI) CF21 Venture Fund for promoting the reuse of Cyberinfrastructure (CI) elements."

This research will investigate the influence of ethnic identity on the processing of Anglo-American and Hispanic felony defendants. Specifically, the study examines the impact of jury composition on conviction and sentencing patterns in felony cases adjudicated in Texas District Courts. Archival data will be analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques that will permit the examination of such factors as how the social status and socioeconomic composition of juries influence their dispositional decisions. Notably, Texas is one of only a few states that permit jury determination of guilt and sentencing in cases other than capital trials. Part of the importance of the research stems from the dearth of extant data concerning the legal treatment of Hispanic defendants. A more important gap in our knowledge of differential justice that will be filled is the consideration in this project of heretofore unexamined aspects of the problem, such as the social status of jurors. This is the first research to examine this issue with respect to the dispositions of Hispanic defendants. The project has the potential not only to contribute to an understanding of the legal treatment of Hispanic defendants, but also more broadly to the development of a model of differential justice that considers the social characteristics of legal decision makers in articulating the impact of law."

The research is grounded in the Smith-Zarate exemplar model of perception which holds that social judgments are based on a target's similarity to past specific memory traces of persons rather than on the target's similarity to abstract prototypes or group stereotypes. Eight studies will test this model within an inter-ethnic context on an international border, investigating how past experiences with individuals from various social groups influence the application of social stereotypes. Questions addressed include how minorities are perceived, how the passage of time influences specific memory traces about people, how people learn about new groups, and how a perceiver's own gender and ethnicity influence social perception processes. The consequences of targets' multiple category membership (e.g., ethnicity and gender) on social judgments are examined in this work which, by using photographs rather than linguistic labels, provides more ecological validity than much of the existing research on stereotyping. Another significant strength of the project is the use of an ethnically diverse subject population, which will provide meaningrful answers to the question of how target and perceiver attributes influence intergroup categorization processes. Finally, the project will advance the theoretical development of exemplar theories of memory and categorization, incorporating modeels of steroetyping into other domains of decision making. This research addresses how and why humans categorize others into groups, the mediating processes predicting categorization, and the consequences of categorizations for stereotype formation and change. The fact that any individual can be categorized in multiple ways (e.g., by gender, ethnicity, occupation) is explored in investigations of how categorization of people is influen ced by the social context in which they appear as well as by the perceiver's own attributes. Thus, for example, one study will test the hypothesis that people will be categorized according to whichever of their attributes is most salient (e.g., most unique) in the social context in which they appear, and that such contextually induced categorization can produce later stereotyping even by judges who were not intially so disposed. This research employs a population of Hispanic students that is underrepresented in basic research on stereotyping and it has the unique advantage of advancing theoretically relevant steroetyping research in an envrionment where a disadvantaged minority (Hispanics) are the local majority. The subject population make these studies ideally suited to providing meaningrful answers to the theoretically important question of how target and perceiver attributes influence intergroup categorization processes. This work is highly relevant to the goals of the NSF Human Capital research agenda in the domain of 'disadvantage in a diverse society', since it will contribute to the understanding of basic cognitive processes that foster stereotyping and discrimination as well as how these effects can be exacerbated or ameliorated by different social contexts."

The question is to understand how migrants use new concepts of ethnicity -- as Latinos in an Anglo-Saxon country, and as Salvadorans -- when their political identity is local in their home country -- to construct their political identities and mobilize support, often transnational, to sustain productive and meaningful lives. The techniques used consist of ethnographic participant observation, and formal interviews of immigrants to understand these transplanted individuals relations to and understandings of the national state. This research is important because transnationalism is a dominant fact of our world. Increased understanding of how people change their identities, and construct new political identities to establish lives in new places and maintain connections with their home places can help us design programs to ameliorate problems and facilitate positive adjustment. The basic question is important -- understanding how Salvadorans living in the US adopt Salvadoran nationalism (missing to a large extent at home) and Latino ethnicity as coping mechanisms to help develop successful lives in the US will be valuable."

It is likely that economic disadvantage plays a key role in explaining victimization risk. Yet, the relationships between violent victimization and race, ethnicity, gender, and economic disadvantage remain poorly understood. The present research will combine data on more than 6.5 million interviews from the National Crime Survey and the National Crime Victimization Survey for the years 1973 through 2008. The project then will use advanced statistical modeling techniques to study similarities and differences in the vulnerability of non-Latino black, non-Latino white, and Latino men and women to violent victimization over more than three decades. The research will examine victimization risks for violence generally, as well as risks for violence by strangers, acquaintances, and intimate partners, which are known to vary across race, ethnicity and gender, as well as over time. The project will produce a series of research papers assessing the complex ways that race, ethnicity, gender, and economic disadvantage combine to explain victimization risks over time, as social conditions change, and thus will identify changing vulnerabilities of minorities and women that constitute an important feature of life in America. <br/><br/>The results of the project will have important policy implications. If, for example, we find that blacks and Latinos are more vulnerable to violent victimization during economic downturns, this could speak to potential benefits of economic assistance programs for reducing victimization. If differences in violence against women across race and ethnic groups are linked to poverty, this would inform the focus of victim-assistance programs. Because this project includes an interdisciplinary team and includes an educational component, it will promote cross-field training of both undergraduates and graduate students in the social sciences and in statistics."

The theoretical utility of this research should be in the conceptual and empirical connection of women's travel patterns to household context, distance perception, and ethnicity. The practical utility lies in the potential for improving traffic forecasting and transport-demand-management models, used for any kind of infrastructural planning or pollution-control scenarios."

As a new and little known class of synthesized materials and devices, nanotechnologies pose an unprecedented case for examining technological beliefs-in-the-making. In the context of federally mandated public participation in nanotech research and development, this project asks how public participants respond to deliberative workshops concerning science and emerging technologies, and in particular, it focuses on the intersecting roles of gender and ethnicity in shaping participants? views and participation in such public forums. The research systematically explores gendered responses in group discussion to issues of technological benefit and risk, governance and responsibility, and societal issues such as equity, privacy, security, job gain and loss, and globalization, from both individual and societal perspectives.<br/><br/>A comparative set of 6 public deliberation workshops on emerging nanotechnologies in the US are conducted. The project convenes 3 groups each on 2 specific science and technology applications: nano health technologies and nano energy technologies. The 3 groups are composed of mixed gender, women-only, and men-only participants, with careful attention to ethnicity composition within each group. The mixed group sessions will provide direct longitudinal comparative data with comparable 2007 workshops and hence the ability to track changing public views. The main purpose is to examine the ways that gender operates as a factor to enable or inhibit full participation in such public forums, and how specific workshop design features such as group size, gender and race/ethnicity composition interact. Data analysis methods are qualitative, with systematic content analysis using qualitative data analysis software."

The goal is to understand the forces directing distinct households' agricultural practices and political allegiances. Three methodological tools will be employed. First, the analysis of agricultural techniques in swidden systems and the mapping of multi-level land use (swidden agriculture, commercial crop production, and cattle grazing) detail actual practices and examine indicators for the intensification and/or depletion of resources. Second, interviews with household members elicit historical understandings of land use changes, resource conflicts, and households' affiliation with the local Indian federations or Campesino organization. Third, archival research of state, church, indigenous relations and state adjudicational legislation presents historical insight into changing racial and legal relations of Indians in the Oriente. The research is significant on two counts. It contributes to scholarship on indigenous resource management and ethnicity by investigating the conditions under which indigenous peoples practice ecologically sound land use and maintain a politicized ethnic identity.

Given the large number of cases (nearly 90,000 local governments) and considerable institutional and contextual variation across and within local governments, one might assume that the study of US local elections is an area of substantial scholarly investigation. And yet this is a relatively unexplored area of inquiry. The absence of scholarly research on local elections is significant, since 96% of the nearly half million elected officials in the US represent local rather than state or federal jurisdictions, and since municipalities have the largest share of elected officials, with 27% (US Census Bureau 1995). <br/><br/>The Local Elections in America Project (LEAP) will accomplish two goals. First, it offers a path-breaking methodology to create a centralized, comprehensive, and cost effective local elections database that will provide unparalleled opportunities for learning about local elections and the political, racial and socio-demographic features of American cities. The software application will systematically collect, digitize, and disseminate data on city council and mayoral elections, employing an automated system that will continue to collect elections data long into the future without ongoing external funding. Moreover, the application will be highly flexible and could therefore be adapted to handle different types of elections (e.g., school board or judicial contests) or units of analysis (precincts). <br/><br/>The second goal of this project is to use the LEAP database as the foundation for research that focuses on the centrality of race/ethnicity in local electoral politics. The increasing racial/ethnic heterogeneity of the US population is nowhere more evident than at the local level, which means that local elections provide the best arena for testing a whole range of theories. This component of the project focuses on the emergence and political ambition of minority candidates in American politics and the role of candidate and voter race/ethnicity in the process and outcome of American elections. To date almost no studies have examined the conditions under which minority candidates run for office and there is little in the way of theory to guide understanding of the ""supply side"" of minority representation. Is the lack of minority representation in elective office due to the defeat of the minority candidate or the absence of minority candidates? No study has even ventured a guess at this question. Other specific questions this project will address include: Under what conditions do African Americans and Latinos decide to run for local office, and how is their ""path to office"" different than that of their white counterparts? And, once the minority candidates are victorious, what is the trajectory of their political careers? How does candidate race/ethnicity shape the competitiveness of municipal elections (including primaries)? <br/><br/>LEAP represents an unprecedented advancement in the areas of data collection and dissemination. The project creates the much needed infrastructure to describe systematically, as never before, the landscape of local politics and elections, to test empirically an unprecedented range of social science theories that have heretofore been little studied in the context of local politics, and to establish an automated and ongoing process of data collection. The database will provide a crucial corollary to current databases and open up local elections to scholars outside of urban politics.

The post-doctoral student has proposed a research project on the effects of race, mobility, and political mobilization on electoral participation. It consists of three components: 1) national field experiment to determine the effect of contact on the participation rates of low propensity voters across three election cycles; 2) determinants of self-reported mobilization by race and ethnicity using a validated post-election multilingual survey; and 3) analysis of the role of residential mobility on participation and mobilization efforts, by race and ethnicity. The research project is situated at the intersection of the political mobilization and minority politics literatures by examining the role of mobilization on participation rates of racial and ethnic minorities. In particular, it seeks to understand the source(s) of the distinct rates of participation among and between different racial and ethnic minorities. While mainstream literature participation focuses on socio-economic characteristics as determinants for mobilization, much of the minority politics literature focus on the effects of political context that affects elite mobilization strategies. This project incorporates both theoretical underpinnings, but suggests that technological innovations and the availability of consumer data have allowed elites to modify their political strategies and therefore micro-target their mobilization efforts. It makes the case that as the determinants of participation and mobilization change, so too should existing theories in political behavior. The goal is to pose research questions and propose the methodological innovations that will shed new light on questions of participation and mobilization. The research has important policy implications on understanding the conditions under which increased political participation of minorities could occur."

Black immigrant and black American participants will be primed with either an American identity or an immigrant identity, then will take a section of the verbal GRE (Graduate Record Examination). Study 2 will measure ethnic differences in the potential mediating factor of race schematicity, and will survey race schematicity and ethnic identity in whites, black Americans, first-generation black immigrants, and second-generation black immigrants. Race schematicity is the degree to which individuals use race to encode and process information (Runkle, 1999). Black Americans and second-generation immigrants are predicted to show different levels of race schematicity as a function of differential exposure to race-related experiences. Study 3 examines the impact of priming race schematicity in black immigrants and black Americans, and measures the effect of salient race-related experience on recall and reaction time to race-related words. Study 4 will explicitly test the potential for mediation of race schematicity in the relationship between ethnicity and performance by manipulating the construct and measuring the effects of the saliency of past race-related events on performance on a section of the verbal GRE.

This dissertation research will focus on the linguistic practices of Vietnamese-American students at a university in Minnesota. Previous sociolinguistic studies of Asian Americans in the U.S. have focused on East Asians; other Asian groups are largely unstudied, even though Southeast Asians comprise the majority of the local Asian-American community in some parts of the country, such as the Twin Cities area in Minnesota. Previous research has shown that Southeast Asians may view themselves differently, as indicated by the use of references such as ""the other Asian"" or ""new wave"", terms that highlight a distinction from other Asian groups.<br/><br/>Three questions guide this research: First, in what ways do members of this organization draw upon linguistic features in constructing their identities both within the organization and in their local community? Second, is there evidence that these speakers use features tied to their heritage language? Third, what practices orient speakers to or away from definitions of ""Vietnamese"" and ""Asian American""? Data for this study will be collected from members of this organization as well as control groups of European Americans and native Vietnamese. Speech data includes individual interviews, group discussions, and spontaneous speech collected in naturalistic settings. Speech data will be complemented by ethnographic information collected through participant observation. <br/><br/>From the point of view of sociolinguistic theory, the purpose of this research is to examine how speakers negotiate a diverse set of identities within the bounds of a specific community and how shared experiences shape the social meaning of linguistic variation. This research will add to our knowledge of the linguistic practices of Asian Americans and emphasize the wide range of histories and cultures that this label encompasses. This research will also focus attention on the varied identities with which ethnic minorities may align themselves."

Despite the importance of bureaucratic decisions on issues that affect minorities, most race and representation scholars have neglected to include this policy-making activity in their analysis of substantive representation. Instead most have focused on roll call voting as the primary measure of representation. This project demonstrates that scholars. inattention to legislative intervention in agency policy-making systematically understates minority members' responsiveness on issues that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities. As a result of racial or ethnic group identity, Black and Latino legislators are more likely (relative to Whites) to intervene in agency actions relating to civil rights enforcement. <br/>This project improves upon the limitations of earlier studies by using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the effects of race or ethnicity in a less visible activity such as committee oversight of agency policies. These methods include a detailed content analysis of congressional oversight hearings and a series of elite interviews with legislators and their staff from the 107th Congress (2001-2002). These data gauge legislators. intensity by examining the amount of time, energy and resources that individual legislators invest in ensuring that bureaucracies are implementing civil rights laws, rules and regulations. <br/> The study expands the conceptualization of substantive representation from an exclusive focus on legislators. roll call voting behavior to one that includes their actions in non-bill related activities such as rulemaking and policy implementation. Additionally, the project shows that racial or ethnic identities of legislators are significant in determining why they pay high costs to intervene in agency policy-making. <br/>Broader Impacts: The research provides insight to policy-makers and scholars by assessing whether racial redistricting measures, designed to get more minorities elected to Congress, translate into enhanced substantive representation of minority interests."

These shifts in demographic and socioeconomic contexts portend tremendous flux in control of urban politics and policy. While the study of race and representation in urban America has a long history, several key questions remain either unanswered or only partly addressed. For example, how do electoral structures (voting methods, term limits, legislature size, off-cycle elections) impact vote choice and minority voter turnout? When and where do they facilitate or hinder cross-over voting? At the same time, new questions are becoming increasingly salient: Under what circumstances do minority candidates emerge? How is this impacted by the use of primary or run-off elections or the presence of multiple racial/ethnic candidates on the same ballot? What role do community organizations, interest groups, and leaders play in urban elections and campaigns? How do campaign finance, and the content, tone and consequences of media coverage impact local elections?<br/><br/>Given the large number of cases and considerable institutional and contextual variation across local governments, one might assume that the study of local elections is an area already well harvested by participation scholars. The truth, however, is that this is a rather unexplored area of inquiry. On the one hand are studies that focus primarily on candidate- and campaign-specific explanations of turnout and vote choices and typically rely on single city or small-N analyses (e.g., Liu & Vanderleeuw 2007; Barreto, Villarreal & Woods 2005; Bullock 1984). While this body of work offers considerable insight about specific electoral contests and proves indispensable with regard to theory and hypothesis building, it is relatively limited when it comes to empirical description and causal inference. A second area of inquiry employs macro-level models and aggregate level data to explore how local context, electoral and other governing arrangements influence two principal phenomena: voter turnout and minority representation in local legislatures. Although these studies typically rely on relatively large samples (e.g., Engstrom & McDonald 1981; Meier et al. 2005; Kelleher & Lowery 2004) only a handful include longitudinal designs (Marschall, Shah & Ruhil 2008; Trounstine & Valdini 2008; Caren 2007; Sass & Pittman 2000; Karnig & Walter 1983) and almost none includes candidate- or campaign-specific covariates (but see Lublin & Tate 1995). Consequently, while these studies are stronger on empirical description and inference, they provide little purchase when it comes to understanding how local electoral dynamics actually shape electoral outcomes.<br/><br/>The first objective of LEAP is to compile the most comprehensive, public-use, database on local governments and elections in America. In addition to aggregate-level turnout and vote choice data across multiple election cycles (primary, run-off and general elections) for a large, representative sample of U.S. jurisdictions, LEAP will also collect election-specific covariates (candidate race/ethnicity and experience, campaign expenditures, issues, and media coverage) for a subset of jurisdictions with populations that are either multi-racial/ethnic or predominately of one minority group. Finally, by also compiling precinct-level data for this subsample of places, the racial and ethnic dimensions of local elections can be appropriately analyzed. With data on multiple offices and elections at two levels of analysis, LEAP will allow for aggregate, hierarchical and ecological analyses of a broad range of questions on political behavior, minority incorporation and urban politics. Thus a second objective of our project is to lay the institutional foundation for making these data as accessible as possible, while at the same time developing a framework for expanding and maintaining these public-use data over time.<br/><br/>This workshop will bring together a wide range of scholars to provide input into what sort of data should be collected and how to proceed with this data collection."

Some scholars find that migration opens room for gender transformations, while others find that it reinforces patriarchal systems. Further, scholars who emphasize the gendered nature of migration have to date focused primarily on immigrants living in the receiving country. Researchers who study transnational communities in both the receiving and sending societies do not address the question of transformations in husband-wife relationships. This research compares three types of Peruvian families: husband-leading migration, wife-leading migration, and family unity migration, and focuses on the question: What are the mechanisms that exacerbate or moderate patriarchal relations in transnational families? Thus, this research aims to resolve a contradiction in the literature about whether transnational connections reaffirm or erode gender hierarchies. The hypothesis is that patriarchal relations will change in form and social arena but will not necessarily go away. <br/><br/>This research is a multi-site ethnographic fieldwork in the U.S. and Peru. Examining not only families and individuals located in the United States, but also their relatives in Peru, allows me to observe strategies adopted by men and women to impose and resist power in their relationships in each type of family. As these mechanisms are present in different social arenas, this research focuses on these dynamics in households, at the community level, and through transnational connections. The investigator conducts in-depth interviewing with and intensive participant observation of multiple members of the same family in the U.S. and in Peru. In so doing, this research investigates the gendered structure of the family and its interconnections with ethnic constructions pertaining to family. The research occurs in three phases. The first (Paterson, NJ in 2006) and the second phases (in Peru 2007) consist of 66 interviews (32 with women and 34 with men) and ethnographic observations within each type of family. The third and last phase will be in Paterson, NJ (2008).<br/><br/>This study makes an important contribution in that it places family at the center of the analysis, highlighting the family's role as a site where gender and ethnic ideas and practices are shaped and reshaped in transnationalism.

It is a study of women immigrants and the New York City garment industry, employing comparative research on two types of sewing shops: those of the Chinese who hire co-ethnics and those of the Koreans who hire Latinos. This will make possible generalizations about the broader categories of race, ethnicity, and gender, and how these categories relate to the larger economic structure of the New York City economy. Participant observation and interviews will be conducted to understand how different immigrants gain jobs, why particular groups have access to certain jobs, and how ethnicity may or may not be used as a resource. %%% This research will contribute to the sociology of immigration, of ethnic groups, and of urban careers. It addresses sociological theories of racial-economic adaptation, that are based on concepts of economic restructuring, social networks, and ethnic succession. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.

It is likely that economic disadvantage plays a key role in explaining victimization risk. Yet, the relationships between violent victimization and race, ethnicity, gender, and economic disadvantage remain poorly understood. The present research will combine data on more than 6.5 million interviews from the National Crime Survey and the National Crime Victimization Survey for the years 1973 through 2008. The project then will use advanced statistical modeling techniques to study similarities and differences in the vulnerability of non-Latino black, non-Latino white, and Latino men and women to violent victimization over more than three decades. The research will examine victimization risks for violence generally, as well as risks for violence by strangers, acquaintances, and intimate partners, which are known to vary across race, ethnicity and gender, as well as over time. The project will produce a series of research papers assessing the complex ways that race, ethnicity, gender, and economic disadvantage combine to explain victimization risks over time, as social conditions change, and thus will identify changing vulnerabilities of minorities and women that constitute an important feature of life in America.<br/><br/>The results of the project will have important policy implications. If, for example, we find that blacks and Latinos are more vulnerable to violent victimization during economic downturns, this could speak to potential benefits of economic assistance programs for reducing victimization. If differences in violence against women across race and ethnic groups are linked to poverty, this would inform the focus of victim-assistance programs. Because this project includes an interdisciplinary team and includes an educational component, it will promote cross-field training of both undergraduates and graduate students in the social sciences and in statistics."

She will analyze remains from three prehistoric cemeteries located in Arica, Chile and which date from the period between A.D. 300-1200. Because of the hot and dry climate human remains as well as delicate cultural materials are extremely well preserved, and in addition to ceramic vessels, these prehistoric graves contain abundant textiles. Decades of archaeological research have indicated that this lowland coastal area of Chile has served at least once and perhaps repeatedly as the destination for groups of individuals who moved westward out of the Andean highlands. Ms. Cassman wishes to understand the long-term mechanisms of culture contact and to determine how, over long periods of time interactions developed between host and immigrant groups. She will use stylistic analysis of both interred bodies and included grave goods to achieve this goal. Textiles play an important role in traditional Andean cultures and a great deal of effort goes into their production. Cloth, with its distinctive designs, serves not only utilitarian and decorative purposes, but also functions as an ethnic marker. The designs it contains and the manner in which it is woven reveals both the status and ethnic identity of its wearer. Therefore it provides an excellent medium for the analysis of cultural process. The Andean and Coastal region of Western South America is marked by strong latitudinal zonation. Resources change dramatically with height and different groups both historically, and presumably prehistorically adapted different strategies to assure an adequate supply of different goods needed for survival. In some cases this was achieved through trade, in others through conquest and in others through colonization. Archaeologists wish to understand the range of strategies and to determine the situations in which different approaches were employed. Through the use of mortuary analysis, Ms. Cassman will have a uniquely rich data base to examine this question. The results will be of interest to many archaeologists. The project will also assist in the training of a promising young scientist."

Using national-level census data and personal interviews conducted in two U.S. cities, the project makes special efforts to measure ethnic identification. It then uses quantitative and qualitative methods to first assess the impact of generation, educational attainment, and residential ethnic concentration of immigrants on Mexican-American intermarriage and the identity of children of such unions. It next examines how social context and culture shape the self-identity of later-generation Mexican-Americans. And it lastly draws out the implications of Mexican self-identity for deciding how to respond to questions in the U.S. census about ethnicity."

This model uses a combination of social and physical forces to determine how the individuals in the model move and interact. The purpose of this expansion is to fold characteristics concerning age, gender, ethnicity, and culture differences into the model, so as to be able to capture reliable differences due to these four factors. Such results could then be used to improve our ability to model social dynamics. This will be done by giving each individual in the simulation, certain traits and characteristics, related to culture, ethnicity, gender, and age. The simulations would then demonstrate how these variations in individual characteristics can affect individual behavior and group behavior, as in a crowd. These four factors (culture, ethnicity, gender, and age) will certainly provide a sufficient space to be interesting. However, there are also interesting cases wherein one would want to model groups of individuals with similar characteristics. These shall be concentrated on at first, expanding the dimension of the space as experience is gained. The distribution of these traits in the simulated populations will be stochastic so as to have flexibility to model a variety of situations (e.g. night club fire, a sporting event, a subway platform). Having stochastic distributions of traits will allow the opportunity to determine how sensitive the overall crowd behavior is to small changes in distributions of the traits. It will also allow us to model ""worst case"" scenarios so that those engaged in crowd control (or building design) can prepare for the most detrimental outcome.<br/><br/>Recent world events prompt research in understanding crowd behavior in emergencies such as nightclub fires, stadium accidents, and subway bombings. The continual threat of global terror and the potential for mass panic could lead to more fatalities of people who are crushed or trampled. This project will use mathematical modeling and simulations to construct models of pedestrian interactions under various situations. The results will be validated using actual crowd movement data obtained from videos from various scenarios. The findings will provide understanding of the influence and importance of social variability under various conditions. The goal of this effort is to provide a more realistic simulation model of crowd behavior under both panic and non-panic conditions by considering individual differences in age, gender, culture and ethnicity. This would be a valuable tool for police departments, the military, and others to use for event handling or in terrorist situations. It could also be used for building design to accommodate cultural differences."

More than once, public misgivings about foreigners have been expressed through support for exclusionary immigration policies (e.g., Higham 1955; King 2000). Political scientists concur that Americans are generally predisposed against immigration, yet it remains unclear whether one or all immigrant groups activate this stance (e.g., Harwood 1986; Simon and Alexander 1993; Citrin et al. 1997). Though history records numerous outbursts of opposition to Irish, Chinese, German, and Italian newcomers (e.g., Shankman 1982; Takaki 1989; Ignatiev 1995; King 2005), we lack a systematic understanding of the degree to which attitudes toward one immigrant group shape public opposition to immigration. Using two original survey-experiments which incorporate an Implicit Association Test (IAT), this project endeavors to demonstrate how Americans'' evaluations of immigration policies are subtly-but indelibly-influenced by anti-Latino attitudes.<br/> A growing volume of polling data on immigration reveals two things: sizeable opposition to immigration and solid support for stronger measures to curb it (Gallup 2000; Lapinski et al. 1997). Yet what these polls do not reveal-and in fact, cannot fully reveal-is the extent to which support for immigration policies is influenced by misgivings about particular immigrants. That is because surveys generally query respondents about these policies without identifying immigrants by ethnicity. And, when group-specific questions are asked, the validity of responses is threatened by strong social norms against the expression of negative attitudes toward ethnic and racial groups (Mendelberg 2001; Banaji et al.1995). <br/> To overcome these challenges, this project employs two survey-experiments which incorporate an Implicit Association Test (IAT) designed to capture negative implicit attitudes toward Latino immigrants. In these experiments, all subjects complete standard self-reports of attitudes toward various immigrant groups, as well as evaluations of policy proposals addressing illegal and legal immigration. During these evaluations, subjects are asked about these policy proposals with reference to either Latino immigrants or non-Latino immigrants. This design aims to demonstrate two things. First, in lieu of implicit attitude measures, Americans should display a markedly even-handed evaluation of immigrants and immigration policies. For instance, it is expected that subjects will support stronger measures to curb immigration regardless of the ethnicity and legal status of foreigners. Yet when implicit attitude measures are introduced, it is anticipated that anti-Latino attitudes will be stamped onto evaluations of these policy proposals, even when they make no reference to Latinos. <br/> The findings from this research have implications both for society in general and the social science community in particular. By documenting how implicit anti-Latino attitudes mold individuals'' preferences for immigration policy, this study systematically challenges the view that opposition to immigration has nothing to do with the ethnicity of immigrants. To the contrary, the evidence from this investigation will suggest that implicit anti-Latino attitudes are activated by merely broaching the issue of immigration, as occurs through public opinion polls. In this way, these findings will raise questions about the validity of standard survey items on immigration by diagnosing how far these questions capture implicit anti-Latino attitudes in addition to policy preferences. Equally important, the evidence will suggest revisions to standard models of survey response to account for an important omitted variable, namely, the influence of implicit attitudes on survey items."

This project pursues research aimed at improving our understanding of the roots of urban agglomeration and the concentration of poverty within cities. First, it examines the determinants of industrial agglomeration within the United States, which should ultimately help us to understand why cities exist. Urban policy needs to recognize the forces that attract both industry and the poor to urban areas. Second, it studies the causes and consequences of segregation by ethnicity within cities. Third, it determines why there is more redistribution to the poor in big cities. As this redistribution may attract the poor to large cities, it may play a role in creating pockets of urban poverty.<br/><br/>Theories of urban concentration emphasize the role of cities in eliminating transport costs for goods, people and ideas. This project quantifies the relative importance of these forces using the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database. In particular, it looks at the determinants of new plant birth and employment levels. It explains the level of new plant growth (and the steady-state level of employment) in a location-industry cell, as a function of the presence of other industries in that location. In particular, the project constructs industry-location specific variables indicating the presence of industries that produce inputs, consume outputs, share ideas and hire the same types of workers. Preliminary work suggests that the most important variable in explaining the location of industries is that the presence of other industries that use the same labor force. To address the endogeneity of the explanatory variables, the interaction of state and industry characteristics are used to predict the level of employment that is used in constructing the explanatory variables.<br/><br/>The project examines the formation and effects of immigrant ghettos. It builds a database on ethnic segregation for a large set of ethnicities and cities dating back to 1910 (and back to 1890 for the foreign born as a whole). This data can be used as a dependent variable to test different theories explaining the extent of immigrant segregation. The data may also help us to understand whether the negative connection between segregation and outcomes for African-Americans in 1990 was true in earlier time periods among different ethnicities. A particular focus of this research proposal is to use within metropolitan area government fragmentation, the location of employment for natives and other variables as sources of identification. Preliminary research suggests that ghettos are not bad for their first generation of inhabitants, but that among later generations there is a much stronger correlation between segregation and negative outcomes for later generations (both for blacks and for immigrants). If segregation only does harm over time, then this fact would support the idea that ghettos are harmful because they discourage human capital accumulation among their younger residents.<br/><br/>The third section of this proposal examines why there is more redistribution in larger cities. The project considers three hypotheses: First, cities have more renters (because of the nature of the housing stock). Second, cities' fixed resources lessen the tendency of the rich to flee high taxes. Third, greater mixing between rich and poor in cities may leads to more altruism or to more of a desire to limit crime through redistribution. The research focus is on finding exogenous sources of variation that determine the level of homeownership, mixing between rich and poor and fixed resources in the city."

The research, primarily descriptive and empirical in approach, will include eliciting lengthy word lists suitable for comparative study, as well as gathering other linguistic data; recording linguistic texts including songs, folktales, myths, ritual languages, play languages, and other traditional verbal arts; and interviewing community members about the traditions and history of each ethnicity. The research promises to make important contributions to understanding the linguistic and ethnographic history and relations not only of the particular ethnic groups studied, but of the region as a whole. The languages to be studied will also provide rich data for consideration of problems of interest to general linguistics such as the relations of register and tone, tonogenetic mechanisms and processes, person-referring forms (pronouns, kinship terms, and so on) and group-referring forms (ethnonyms and glossonyms), play languages and speech surrogates, and reduplication and parallelism."

Although a limited tradition of sociolinguistic inquiry into Native American English varieties has now developed, some essential dimensions of these varieties remain largely ignored. Curiously, one of the most critical but neglected areas of study with respect to Native American varieties of English is the extent to which these varieties may or may not adopt local dialect norms. Such linguistic accommodation is often an important index of assimilation and may indicate in subtle but essential ways how such groups situate themselves sociolinguistically and culturally. Furthermore, the investigation of the types of sociolinguistic boundaries that exist between vernacular varieties, particularly in tri-ethnic contexts, is critical in addressing central issues concerning the dynamic nature of ethnolinguistic boundaries in American English varieties. This research examines language change and variation in the English of three post-insular Native American communities in rural North Carolina. The Lumbee, Haliwa Saponi, and Cherokee Native American communities of North Carolina represent instructive contrasts in terms of (1) their recognized status as Native Americans communities, (2) their historic isolation from surrounding communities, and (3) their past and present language contact situations. These situations thus offer a unique laboratory for comparing how ethnic groups configure their sociolinguistic identity over time and space. Extensive cross-generational sociolinguistic interviews are being conducted in each research site, both with local Native Americans and with cohort speakers from corresponding contact varieties. Qualitative-descriptive and quantitative-variationist analytical models are applied to the emerging data, and the objective analysis of language variation is complemented by the analysis of data obtained from subjective speaker identification tasks. The comparative analysis includes both intra- and inter-regional dimensions in order to determine the dynamic nature of sociolinguistic boundaries.

Cox, Principal Investigator<br/>J. Steven Reznick, Co-Principal Investigator<br/><br/>The North Carolina Child Development Research Collaborative (CDRC) proposed here builds upon ongoing multidisciplinary activities across departments at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and neighboring institutions of Duke, University of North Carolina at Greensboro and North Carolina State. Investigators from disparate areas of developmental inquiry-from behavioral genetics and developmental neuroscience to life-course sociology, anthropology, public health, nursing, social work, education and developmental psychology-will participate in the research and training at the CDRC. The CDRC's efforts are informed by an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the development of youth that includes investigation of cultural and societal factors studied by anthropologist and sociologists to the neural and genetic levels studied by biologists and neuroscientists. The work of the CDRC will transcend a ""main effect"" model of development that sees each influence as an independent contribution and will embrace a model in which influences from various levels (the community, the family, neural and genetic factors etc.) are seen as working together. <br/>The CDRC will increase the capacity of faculty and students to conduct interdisciplinary research. This will be accomplished by launching a new longitudinal, collaborative research study focusing on early childhood. From birth to school entry, children show remarkable linguistic, intellectual, emotional and social change while going through successive transitions between social contexts such as from family to day care or nursery school, annual changes from one peer group to another, and later changes from preschool to kindergarten. This study will tap levels of analysis relevant for understanding early development, extending beyond the individual and dyad to include assessments of biological functioning, cognitive competence, personality and emotion, social relationships, neighborhood, community, and culture in which persons and interactions are embedded. Beginning in the first year of life, we will track these multiple levels of analysis during periods of transition to elucidate both the constraints posed by the child's environment as well as illustrating the ability of the child to adapt to new environments and conditions. A representative sample of 200 children born during a 3-month period will be recruited into the study from birth records in Durham, North Carolina. Durham is a mid-size city with typical characteristics of cities around the United States: a diverse population in terms of family ethnicity, income, and education; a declining city center with large pockets of poverty and limited employment opportunities; and wide variation in the quality of child care and school settings. Durham has an almost equal representation of African-American and Euro-American families and a rapidly increasing Hispanic population. Moreover, Durham has a large African-American middle class population, thus making it possible to study ethnicity disentangled from socioeconomic status among both African-American and Euro-American groups. Children will be tested initially within a 2-week period on either side of their first birthday and followed longitudinally through their fourth birthday. Additional assessments will be conducted at the second and third birthday and midway between birthdays (i.e., at 18, 30, and 42 months). <br/>Integrated working groups of researchers will implement multiple levels of measurement. Six working groups focus on: biological processes; temperament and emotional regulation; memory, language, and literacy; peer relations as contexts; family and intergenerational relationships; child care, community, and culture. A seventh working group provides expertise on quantitative approaches to longitudinal analyses. <br/>The CDRC will also initiate and support other linked endeavors including: 1) conducting workshops, seminars and course development to increase cross-disciplinary knowledge, 2) developing new methods for interdisciplinary research, and 3) training a diverse cadre of young scholars who are equipped to pursue collaborative interdisciplinary research."

The principal purpose of this research is to develop an improved understanding of the linkage between income, assets, and cause-specific adult mortality that also takes into account the varied race/ethnic composition of the population. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) assemble an integral, prospective database that will allow us to simultaneously examine the effects of a more comprehensive set of income and asset variables on U.S. cause-specific adult mortality than has heretofore been the case, (2) test whether the effects of family income on adult mortality risk depend upon the type of income received, (3) examine whether the ownership of material assets, an important but often overlooked dimension of SES, influences mortality risks, even above and beyond the influences of family income, and (4) test whether family income and asset variables interact with race/ethnicity-non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Rican Americans, and Asian Americans-to affect the risk of mortality. <br/><br/>A database has been created from pooled information (five years of data) from the Family Resource Supplements (FRS) of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), matched to death information from the National Death Index (NDI). The resultant dataset containing pooled information from the two surveys is the newest available source with national data that allows for detailed analysis of economic differences in cause-specific mortality."

One way is though political institutions such as electoral and party systems. But in many countries, the level of public services provided to citizens ranges enormously at the sub national level. This means that even with identical electoral and party structures, some local governments do more for their citizens than others. Why do some of these governments fund more education, more health, and more infrastructure projects than others? Since much of economic development hinges on public services, understanding how citizens hold their governments accountable for their provision is central to the task of understanding economic development itself.<br/><br/>This research explores the determinants of political accountability in sub Saharan Africa by examining the incentives of local-level politicians in over 750 districts in six African countries. Development policy over the past two decades has changed radically from a narrow concentration on economic issues to a broad concern with political institutions and accountability. But while practitioners may now believe the importance of accountability to development, we did not have a good understanding of the causes of that accountability.<br/><br/>By using sub national level data, I tease out two important non-institutional types of factors that enhance or impede accountability. First, I explore the effects of social and structural factors -- such as wealth, social capital, and ethnicity -- that explain public service provision. For Africa especially, the effect of ethnicity on government performance has received an enormous amount of attention, but has not been tested systematically. Second, I examine how the fiscal links between citizens and their government helps determine accountability. In my previous work using sub national data from Tanzania and Zambia, I have found strong support for the idea that the source of government revenue affects political accountability: the more local taxes a district government collects from its own constituents, the more public services it provides; the more donor or central government money it collects, the fewer services it supplies. Where politicians get their money affects what they do.<br/><br/>Africa is the poorest continent and currently the object of great attention for its plight. Understanding the causes of political accountability increases the possibility that willing African governments can design their policies so as to increase the public services they provide. For willing and unwilling African countries, this study increases the chances that donors can create aid packages that work better. Bilateral and multilateral donor organizations are creating new policies at this very moment to increase accountability as a condition on continued assistance.<br/><br/>No one has compiled or used complete sets of sub national African data to explore the effects of government revenue, ethnicity, and aid on public service provision. Accurate tests to tease out what causes governments to provide crucial public services are also virtually unknown. My early research has already been discussed by officials at the US Agency for International Development, the UK's Department for International Development, and the World Bank. This project provides students and scholars of development policy with better theoretical approaches and valuable, previously unused data. It also supplies policymakers with tools for designing more effective development policies for the only geographical region in the world where poverty is still increasing."

Using violence data from three large states (California, New York, Pennsylvania), disaggregated by race-ethnicity (white, black, Latino), and using census places as the unit of analysis, three key questions are addressed: 1) Do structural factors and community characteristics have uniform effects on racially disaggregated violence rates (i.e., on Latino rates, on black rates, and on white rates)? 2) To what extent do structural factors or contextual characteristics explain white-Latino, black-Latino, and black-white differences in violence rates? 3) To what degree do structural factors render spurious the effects of racial/ethnic composition (percent black, percent Latino) on overall rates of violence across census places? These questions adjoin two of the most important substantive and theoretical issues facing sociology and law/criminology. The first is whether, and to what extent, race and ethnicity are related to violent crime. The second involves the racial invariance hypothesis about whether, and to what extent, spatial or community-level characteristics hypothesized to influence violent crime have the same effects on blacks whites, and Latinos, or any race-ethnic group. Broader impacts of the project adjoin larger societal concerns as well as broad substantive interests within law, sociology, criminology, and public health, fields which have longstanding interests in stratification and racial inequality and their effects on various markers of social and economic well being. The ability to tie race/ethnicity to variation in violent crime, and to the structural sources of that variation, is important for guiding future theoretical and research efforts aimed at understanding and ameliorating group differences in crime."

Victimization is defined as the kind of bullying, terrorizing, or intimidation of targeted students that takes place in and around school where adult supervision is minimal. A longitudinal study is proposed that follows approximately 2000 6th graders as they enter one of nine middle schools in metropolitan Los Angeles. The schools will be selected to vary according to ethnic composition, but to be similar in terms of socioeconomic class of students, size, and overall achievement level. Data will be gathered twice yearly over the three middle school years on students' experiences with victimization, the perceived causes of such harassment, and indicators of psychological, social, and school adjustment. Statistical analyses will investigate change in all of these variables over time. The specific aims of the project are to : (1) examine the individual and contextual antecedents of victimization that are particularly salient during early adolescence such as ethnicity, pubertal timing, and one's position in the peer group; (2) investigate the consequences of victimization, including subjective well-being, rejection by peers, and school performance and attitudes; (3) test a model of the relations between victimization and adjustment that views self-blaming attributions as a key variables; and (4) explore the adjustment patterns of subtypes of victimized young adolescents who may be most at risk for psychological, social, and school dysfunction. <br/><br/>Findings of the project will provide new insights into the dynamics of peer victimization and advance the field in several ways. First, the focus on early adolescence and the transition to middle school calls attention to the key developmental milestones of this age period, such as the onset of puberty, increasing salience of ethnic identity, and heightened concern about peer approval, that may have important implications for how one copes with victimization. Second, the concern with models that view antecedents and consequences of victimization as sets of interrelated variables provides a useful conceptual framework for organizing the growing literature on peer harassment. And thirdly, by examining growth and change in a longitudinal design, the study can shed light on the stability of victimization as well as both continuous and discontinous pathways to successful adaptation during the critical middle school years."

Tamara Bray and Cristobal Landazuri will conduct one season of research in the Pimampiro district in northern Ecuador. The district lies at the extreme eastern end of a semi-arid deeply incised river valley in the northernmost highlands of Ecuador at approximately 1600 meters above sea level. The drainage is one of the few that breach the western cordillera to empty into the sea and thus it occupies an unusual and important geographic position. Ecuador, in common with other Andean countries, is characterized by three distinct physiographic zones. A dry Pacific coastal zone, a central mountainous region and an eastern lowland tropical rainforest. Because of their close proximity and the fact that each zone contains unique and valuable resources, archaeologists have focused on the political and economic strategies employed by prehistoric peoples and attempted to determine the extent and nature of trade and interaction across these areas. A series of states and empires arose in many parts of this broad region and scientists wish to understand the extent to which the desire and need to control resources from several zones played a role. It is in this context that Drs. Bray and Landazuri's research is important. Because of its highland position and its easy connection to both Pacific coast as well an Amazonian lowlands, Pimampiro provides an excellent venue to examine the extent and nature of interaction. Using a three pronged approach the researchers plan to examine regional networks of exchange. Although a prehistoric state did not arise in Pimampiro the investigators believe that extensive tans-zonal interaction took place. They will conduct archaeological excavation, examine extensive early Spanish descriptions of the region and analyze botanical remains recovered from prehistoric features. On the basis of preliminary survey, they have decided to focus attention on the site of Shanshipampa. Located on an alluvial terrace of the river valley, the site's most notable feature is a large rectangular stone pavement 31 meters long by 6 meters wide. The pavement contains sculpted motifs which indicate close ties with the eastern lowlands. Two adjacent carved stone monuments contain images of monkeys and snakes suggestive of tropical lowland fauna. Through excavation of both agricultural surfaces and house mounds it should be possible to determine the crops produced (and whether they served as trade goods) and also the ethnicity of the inhabitants. On the basis of descriptions in ethnohistoric documents it is possible that lowland peoples resided in specific parts of the valley and the researchers wish to determine if this in fact occurred. This research is important for several reasons. It will help to fill an important geographic gap in the archaeological record and provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also provide insight into the large scale inter-regional subsistence adaptations."

The study systematically assesses strategies employed by lawyers and judges as they attempt to manage multiple, and potentially conflicting, identities and it seeks to understand the circumstances under which these identities affect job-related interactions. The research examines changing legal guidelines that have resulted in en masse hearings related to immigration cases. This change provides a site for observing heightened identity conflict between role identities (a form of personal identity that often focuses on work roles) and social identities. In particular, judges and lawyers take on a specific work-related role identity that entails assisting in the conviction and sentencing of people with whom they share a particular social identity/race/ethnicity, but do not share another social identity/citizenship. This research bridges a gap and also expands other research to recognize and categorize identity management strategies such as distancing, assigned vs. asserted identities, and impression management.<br/><br/>This study asks the following research questions: 1) Do Latino/a lawyers and judges involved in these cases manage their potentially conflicting identities differently than non-Latino/as? 2) Is a shared social identity with defendants detrimental or useful in the work of these Latino/a lawyers and judges? To answer these questions, this research employs a mixed-method qualitative research design, including: content analyses of legal documents, media reports, and activist publications; ethnographic observations of courtroom proceedings; and interviews with attorneys and judges (both Latino/a and non-Latino/a) that include an embedded experiment.<br/><br/>The resultant theory of conflicting identity management will contribute broadly to future research on identity. Conflicting identity management theory will also inform best practices on how to deal with potentially conflicting identities in work settings. The research can also contribute to specific understandings of how the criminal justice system deals with racial/ethnic issues surrounding immigration crimes and en masse proceedings. Understanding the broader effects of the program on legal professionals is especially important not only to social scientists but to society at large."

GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. This study will address two core research questions in the area of STEM Workforce Development: Are there gender and racial/ethnic disparities in STEM faculty hiring? If so, what conditions, processes and social contexts generate/mitigate these disparities? The researchers will conduct a systematic theory-driven evaluation of the faculty hiring process by compiling an unprecedented dataset on faculty hiring across ten research-intensive universities. The data will be used to test hypotheses about how gender and race/ethnicity influence applications for faculty positions, evaluation of applicants, and outcomes at multiple stages in the faculty hiring process. By identifying the steps in the hiring process that are most susceptible to bias and the characteristics of the hiring process that amplify/mitigate disparities, this study will identify the most important targets for policy interventions aimed at increasing equity and diversity in faculty hiring.<br/><br/>The study will be framed by expectation states theory, which explains how status beliefs (widely shared beliefs that people in one category of a status-based social distinction, such as gender or race, are more socially worthy and competent than those in another category) influence interpersonal interactions, evaluations of self and others, and individual and group behavior to generate and reinforce social inequality. The researchers will construct and use a unique dataset from an online administrative system that compiles information from all faculty recruitments at all University of California campuses. This rich data source includes detailed information on applicant pools, applicant credentials and achievements, hiring processes and committees, and candidates? progression from application through the short list, interview, and offer steps in the process. The richness of the administrative data will be enhanced using automated text analytic tools to generate a dataset that provides large sample sizes, detailed measurement of key variables, links to supplemental data sources that provide measures of influential factors (e.g., institutional prestige), and observable variation in factors which theory predicts affect bias in faculty hiring. Multilevel statistical models will be used to accurately identify and disentangle the influences operating at the faculty search-level versus those operating at the applicant-level to affect the faculty hiring process.

The new knowledge generated by this study will increase understanding of girls' and other under-represented groups' (racial and ethnic minorities, low-income youth) retention in and attrition from the STEM ""pipeline"" during the high school years. The study will be conducted by the Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College, in collaboration with Tufts University and the Boston Museum of Science, and the Boston Public Schools (BPS) Science Department. Study participants will be drawn from students at exam schools and/or science-themed schools within BPS, a large and diverse school system in which 45% of students are Black, 32% Hispanic, 14% White, and 8% Asian; 74% of students are eligible for free or reduced lunch. <br/><br/>Research questions for the study include: (1) How do the extent and type of STEM-relevant support provided by relationships in students' lives influence educational experiences and aspirations related to STEM study and career development; (2) Do patterns of STEM influence differ by gender and race/ethnicity for urban public high school students; and (3) What typologies of support and influence best predict STEM persistence in high school? This is a mixed-methods study featuring integrated qualitative and quantitative data collection and data analysis.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit--The study will add to existing knowledge on girls' retention in and attrition from STEM by examining gender-based differences in girls' and boys' formal and informal science education experiences, including interest, choice, achievement and use of STEM-related resources. The field has lacked theory-driven, prospective studies of persistence in STEM fields that examine students' lives in their multiple contexts. The original contribution of this research is that it will draw from and synthesize three theoretical traditions to increase understanding of girls' access to and persistence in the STEM pipeline: the social-ecological tradition (which examines multiple levels of influence in students' lives, ranging from proximal (e.g., family and school) to more distal (e.g., availability of post-secondary STEM programs, cultural-level beliefs about gender roles); the trilogy model of STEM success (engagement, capacity, and continuity); and relationship science (which examines relationships, their specific characteristics, and the specific functions they perform). The three theoretical approaches will complement each other for a more differentiated understanding of variability in girls' persistence in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Broader Impact--The increased knowledge generated by this study will inform ways to increase the participation of girls and other under-represented groups (e.g., racial and ethnic minorities, low-income youth) in sustained STEM study and subsequent employment, in the interest of broadening and diversifying the future STEM workforce. The investigators will work with science educators and outreach program directors to integrate the knowledge into their programs. Dissemination venues include local science education associations as well as national groups such as the Women in Engineering Programs & Advocates Network, the American Society of Engineering Education, and the National Science Teachers Association."

As part of ECR, this project is funded by the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering (GSE) program. GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. This study will address two core research questions in the area of STEM Workforce Development: Are there gender and racial/ethnic disparities in STEM faculty hiring? If so, what conditions, processes and social contexts generate/mitigate these disparities? The researchers will conduct a systematic theory-driven evaluation of the faculty hiring process by compiling an unprecedented dataset on faculty hiring across ten research-intensive universities. The data will be used to test hypotheses about how gender and race/ethnicity influence applications for faculty positions, evaluation of applicants, and outcomes at multiple stages in the faculty hiring process. By identifying the steps in the hiring process that are most susceptible to bias and the characteristics of the hiring process that amplify/mitigate disparities, this study will identify the most important targets for policy interventions aimed at increasing equity and diversity in faculty hiring.<br/><br/>The study will be framed by expectation states theory, which explains how status beliefs (widely shared beliefs that people in one category of a status-based social distinction, such as gender or race, are more socially worthy and competent than those in another category) influence interpersonal interactions, evaluations of self and others, and individual and group behavior to generate and reinforce social inequality. The researchers will construct and use a unique dataset from an online administrative system that compiles information from all faculty recruitments at all University of California campuses. This rich data source includes detailed information on applicant pools, applicant credentials and achievements, hiring processes and committees, and candidates' progression from application through the short list, interview, and offer steps in the process. The richness of the administrative data will be enhanced using automated text analytic tools to generate a dataset that provides large sample sizes, detailed measurement of key variables, links to supplemental data sources that provide measures of influential factors (e.g., institutional prestige), and observable variation in factors which theory predicts affect bias in faculty hiring. Multilevel statistical models will be used to accurately identify and disentangle the influences operating at the faculty search-level versus those operating at the applicant-level to affect the faculty hiring process. Analyses will be disaggregated by STEM discipline, gender, detailed race/ethnicity and race-by-gender categories."

Citizen involvement in serious games and games for learning has increased exponentially in the last decade. At the same time, it is becoming clear that these activities can play an important, possibly profound, role in fostering learning if they are designed and used well to do that. When students engage in game design, this can also be important for fostering participation and learning -- in computing and other STEM disciplines, and beyond. But little is known about how to take into account gender and ethnicity in integrating games for learning into educational activities. This workshop will focus on special research issues in designing games for learning and effectively using them to foster STEM engagement and learning among two populations under-represented in STEM -- women/girls and minorities. The team will also deliver a set of talks based on the workshop and will produce an edited volume that will present the results of the workshop to the many different research, development, and education communities that can benefit from understanding gender and ethnicity issues in fostering learning, the challenges in addressing those issues, what is already known about addressing those issues, and what still needs to be learnrd to address them more fully and put what is known into practice.<br/><br/>Serious game play and game design have both been shown to foster excitement about STEM and STEM learning when designed and used well for those purposes. The PIs aim to better understand how to broaden participation of minorities and women in computational thinking and computing and to help those populations become more interested and conversant in STEM topics. There is much research that shows the potential for serious games to foster such engagement and learning, and their focus is on how to use such resources well in fostering participation and learning among girls and minority groups under-represented in computing and other STEM disciplines. They will bring together researchers whose expertise is design of serious games and games for learning, public policy researchers focused on education and broadening participation, and people from industry at a workshop aimed toward framing interactions across gender, race, and ethnicity to advance understanding of gender and ethnicity-related issues in learning through serious game play and game design."

The HRM initiative will document and clarify how race and ethnicity have mediated the workings of national economies, starting with the United States. Because it will critically engage the often ignored scholarship of African-American, Latino, and Asian-American economists, the HRM initiative will deepen the knowledge base available to scholars, policy makers and activists grappling with matters of race, policy, and political economy. The research team also will draw critically from multiple intellectual traditions within the social sciences. The investigator intends that the research and analysis produced will be made available and accessible to policy makers, social justice advocates, teachers, and academics. The project will foster the political consensus needed to establish social policies that will sustain humane communities in the transnational economy of the twenty-first century.

In many respects, the refugee experience itself has become subsumed by a medical etiology or the ""naming and framing"" of trauma within the paradigm of Western psychiatry and medical pathology. As a consequence of ascribing a socially-bound sick role little attention is focused on the post migration structural needs affecting the mental health and well-being of refugees, e.g., the need for employment and housing. Further, little attention is focused on their day-today lives and experiences as immigrants in the context beyond individual-level mental health. In this dissertation research, the co-PI will conduct 20-30 in-depth interviews with primarily Tibetan and African refugee survivors of torture and war trauma living in New York City and complete a quantitative analysis of approximately 740 medical clinic intake files from the Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture. These data will be used to study the role of post-migration factors (such as current economic deprivation, unstable housing, tenuous legal status), in predicting poor mental health. Employing a social construction of illness perspective the co-PI will look at how refugees themselves conceptualize distress or problems in their lives (as medical, spiritual, individual problem, family problem, etc.), and how this may conflict with the underlying cultural, social, and medical model assumptions made by clinicians. Finally, this research allows the co-PI to look critically at the role of race and ethnicity in both the larger social construction of mental health among refugees -- including dimensions of racialized global politics, differential international intervention and humanitarian aid, etc. and the role of race and ethnicity in immigrant assimilation, specifically locating Tibetan and African refugees in the larger racial landscape of New York City.<br/><br/>This research will advance an understanding of well being among refugee survivors of torture and war trauma that transcends medical/psychological paradigms of trauma. It will broaden the understanding of a largely underserved population of Tibetan and African refugees in NYC, illuminating their mental health outcomes and structural non-medical needs, as well as their modes of immigrant incorporation and negotiation of race and ethnicity."

Federal institutions combine shared-rule with self-rule and may, therefore, represent a compromise between sub-national challengers and the central leadership of the state, which is often reluctant to give up territory or power. Indeed, some scholars have found empirically that federalism has a ""peace-preserving"" effect, arguing that it reduces the likelihood of conflict by providing sub-national groups with institutional channels for voicing their demands. But these findings have been disputed by others, who maintain that federalism is not ""peace-preserving"" at all but actually encourages conflict by providing such groups with resources for mobilization. Over the past decades, while some federations have been free from internal conflicts, others have gone through periods of significant, prolonged violence, and still others have experienced occasional uprisings. What explains these divergent theoretical conclusions and empirical outcomes? <br/><br/>To answer this question, it is critical to ask not only whether, but also under which conditions, federalism can contribute to defusing intrastate conflicts. This study will argue that the growing body of research addressing similar puzzles falls short on two accounts. First, absent is a systematic comparison of peaceful and conflict-ridden cases across federal states. Second, some studies seem to suggest that there is one optimal mix of decentralization and centralization, while others acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits-all federal solution but leave this without further theorizing. This study argues that the degree to which federal institutions can contribute to defusing conflict depends on how these institutions interact with the underpinnings of the societies they govern. In particular, the study proposes to demonstrate how and why the ""peace-preserving"" effect of specific federal traits-fiscal decentralization, political decentralization, and political co-partisanship-are conditional on a society's income level and ethnic composition. The study's central argument consists of three hypotheses that specify how federal institutions interact with these characteristics of societies, which will be tested against alternative explanations. The methods include both a quantitative analysis of provinces in 23 federal states and a qualitative, comparative analysis of separatist mobilization in three provinces over time: Chechnya, Punjab, and Quebec. Testing and piecing out the causal mechanisms of these hypotheses will require significant data collection, including field research in Russia, India, and Canada.<br/><br/>This study promises to enrich our understanding of how particular forms of governance affect the<br/>likelihood of intrastate conflicts, in particular self-determination conflicts. Drawing on research on ethnicity, political mobilization, civil wars, and political institutions, the study proposes to empirically demonstrate how federalism's ""peace-preserving"" effects are conditional on societal traits. Theoretically, the study has implications for our understanding of the relationship between institutions and society more broadly, as it sets out to systematically assess how institutional effects may vary from society to society. Beyond the scholarly implications, the broader societal impact of the study is that it promises to provide policy guidelines for the ways in which federal institutions can be tailored to specific societies to lessen<br/>the chances of intrastate conflicts. Policy-makers have explored federal solutions to the conflicts between the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan government, the Kosovo-Albanians and the Yugoslav government, and the Kurds and the Iraqi central authorities. Even though both policy-makers and scholars have come to view federal institutions as suitable for defusing conflicts in divided states, it is still unclear which factors contribute to the divergent track record of conflict in existing federations and how federalism's ""peace-preserving"" effects work. This study aims to directly address the issue of what sorts of institutions under which circumstances may reduce the possibility of intrastate conflicts. The investigators plan to share their findings with scholars and policy-makers both in the United States and abroad."

This project addresses the nature of the conversion process as well as the place of Christian religious practices in contemporary Sivuqaq identity. Using a combination of ethnohistorical, ethnographic and textual analytical methods, the student will look at the relationship between social practice, historical process and cultural mediation. This project will contribute to the important current debate on the role of Christianity and missionization in the incorporation of non-western peoples into the industrial world. In addition, it will have applied as well as theoretical implications. As Eskimos try to cope with a changing world, it is crucial that we understand the processes that have affected them and influenced their sense of identity."

Friendship may be crucial to how students navigate academics and other aspects of college life. Recent sociological research focusing on high school students has pointed to the role of student clubs and organizations in facilitating the formation of peer groups and friendships that support academic and social identities. However, we know little about the broader role that friendship plays in academic life and transitions between worlds, particularly for college students. This study will explore students' friendships, especially as they relate to the connection between academic and social aspects of college life, through a minimum of 80 in-depth individual interviews and 12 focus group interviews with undergraduates at a large, public research university. Guided by social psychological, critical race, and feminist theories, as well as multiple worlds and subcultural approaches, this research will highlight possible bridges between academic and social worlds, such as participation in student organizations and academically-based friendships. The intent of this project, then, is to answer the following questions: To what extent do undergraduates perceive and personally experience academic and social life as integrated or separated? In what ways are friends involved in academic and intellectual life? How do friendships and social networks facilitate and/or impede students' navigation of academic and social life? How do organizational structures (e.g., student clubs) facilitate and/or impede students' navigation of academic and social life? How do social identities-particularly gender and race-inform students' perceptions and navigation of academic and social worlds? How does the social location of friends (e.g., friendships among students of color or friendships between men and women) inform students' perceptions and navigation of these worlds? Through answering these and other research questions, this research will contribute to sociological understandings of higher education, college culture, youth and adolescence, race/ethnicity, gender, and friendship through enhancing our understandings of how different gender, racial/ethnic, and other social identities interfere with and/or facilitate academic identities and illuminate what can be done to strengthen academic success for diverse populations. This research will have broader impacts beyond its contributions to sociological and educational scholarship. This research will be of interest to educational administrators and policy makers, especially those whose programs are aimed at improving the day-to-day lives of undergraduate students (e.g., classroom learning, dormitories, living-learning centers, and student groups). As women's and men's roles change and more students attend college from diverse backgrounds, we need to examine the practices that currently limit or enhance the development of strong academic and social identities. Understanding the role friendship plays in students' perceptions of academic and social worlds may help us better understand why some students succeed academically or persist in college while others do not."

Mentoring activities are critical for successful promotions in the professoriate, and they are particularly needed for underrepresented faculty in the field of computing. The number of minority faculty or faculty with disabilities at most institutions is very small, making it difficult to find role models and mentors with similar experiences and backgrounds. To address this problem, the PI has developed a series of Academic Career Mentoring Workshops for Underrepresented Participants. The series started in 2005 and has been funded by an NSF BPC grant from 2007 through 2011. The Academic Career Mentoring Workshop series targets junior faculty and senior graduate students from the following underrepresented groups: African American, Hispanic, Native American, and people with disabilities. The Workshops will include senior faculty from these groups that can serve as role models and present proven strategies for academic careers in computing. With this proposal, the PI requests funding to continue and to assess these workshops.<br/><br/>The Workshops will cover cultural issues and their influence on topics such as starting a research program, networking, and navigating the tenure process. Panelists will be asked to address issues such as ""Maintaining One's Identity"" and ""Overcoming Misconceptions,"" that address frustrations unique to underrepresented faculty and potential faculty (or senior graduate students). For example, ethnic minority faculty often struggle with the dilemma of maintaining one's culture given the significant time necessary to launch a research program. Further, underrepresented faculty must make a concerted effort, well beyond the norm, to find outlets and support communities of similar ethnicity. These problems can result in disillusionment that may result in young faculty choosing other career opportunities outside of academia. The proposed workshop complement the existing CRA-W Workshops, which focus on gender, and CRA Workshops, which do not target issues faced by women or ethnic minorities."

A gene that has been subjected to selection may leave a ""footprint"" in the genome that can provide clues about the genetic basis of adaptation. Two genes (the oxytocin receptor [OTR] and vasopressin type II receptor [AVPR2]) that are vital to mammalian reproduction, homeostasis, and behavior will be sequenced in order to characterize nucleotide diversity among ethnically diverse humans. OTR plays critical roles in birth, lactation, and social and sexual behavior while AVPR2 is important for regulation of body water and electrolytes. These genes may have been targets of selection in primates, including humans. This will be the first study to survey both genes in a large sample (approximately 315 individuals) of healthy individuals from 21 geographically and ethnically diverse populations, including 11 distinct African populations. OTR and AVPR2 will also be sequenced in a number of nonhuman primate (NHP) species. The researchers will apply a variety of analytical tools to the data in order to: (1) characterize levels and patterns genetic diversity (2) detect signatures of selection and (3) clarify the evolutionary history of OTR and AVPR2. They will also test for correlations among genetic diversity and geography, climate, subsistence (e.g. hunting/gathering, agriculture) and ethnicity to look for evidence of local adaptation. Since this type of data can be influenced by factors such as historical population size, computer modeling will be used to distinguish the effects of selection and demography. <br/>This study will increase understanding of the genetic basis of human adaptations during the course of human evolution. Combined with findings from other studies, these data will help to distinguish the role of human demographic history, recombination, and natural selection on shaping patterns of variation in the human genome. This analysis of non-coding variation will improve knowledge about the demographic history of African populations and help to reconstruct modern human origins. By comparing AVPR2 and OTR in humans and NHP, we will gain knowledge about protein evolution in primates and genetic differences and similarities between humans and NHP. Due to the size and diversity of the sample, the SNPs identified should include both rare and common variants, some of which may be useful for the study of genetic susceptibility to disease. This project will directly support the training of a U.S. graduate student in molecular biology and population genetics and includes a number of African populations, which are underrepresented in many types of human genetics research. The data, including SNPs, will be made available publicly in online databases."

Definitions of democracy stress the importance of participation and suffrage for all. However, when operationalized, suffrage, with the exception of gender, as it applies to groups separated from the dominant civic community by race ethnicity, and conquest has been either slighted or ignored. This has meant that while the move from nondemocratic forms of government to elite democracy has been studied, the move from exclusive democracy to more inclusive democracy that allow most adults to vote has been ignored. This dissertation research creates a database tracking the achievement of suffrage for different groups in democracies from 1800 to 1998. The database is used to test a theory that explains the move from exclusion to inclusion in democracies through the interaction of material, political and normative power. This will help to integrate theoretically the interaction of these different types of power that are usually dealt with separately in the literature. The database also serves as an important resource beyond the current research to those who would explore the causes and impacts of the expansion of the basic right to participate that suffrage represents.<br/><br/>This dissertation research project promises to enhance substantially our understanding of the topic."

The survey will ask whether respondents are willing to limit their own personal freedom, the freedom of people who are like them, or those who are different from them. It is exactly the fact that efforts to constrict personal freedom are motivated by a threat to public safety that allows the researchers to question whether people are differentially committed to civil liberties norms.

In many social settings trust and reciprocity can improve the well-being of both parties. Quite often brief, face-to-face interactions are the primary basis by which individuals initiate and build social networks in economic and political arenas. If particular ethnic groups are not trusted in these brief interactions (through discrimination), then individuals from those ethnic groups lose the opportunity to prove themselves trustworthy. Consequently those individuals lose access to many financial opportunities that stem from repeated interactions that are fueled by trusting relationships.<br/><br/>Laboratory experiments are used by which strangers make decisions with one another. The decisions involve financial stakes in which one person can trust another, and in return, a counterpart can choose to be trustworthy. The experiments manipulate three major variables: the ethnicity of the partners; the framework in which the decision is cast; and the institutional guarantees underlying the trust game. The experimental are novel in that they are conducted via the internet, in real time, between multiple laboratories. The experiments suggest policy interventions that can encourage initial trusting behavior through minimizing discrimination."

This group, known as the Racial Democracy, Crime and Justice Network (RDCJN) established a Summer Research Institute (SRI) and annual summer workshops with prior NSF support. To date, the group has supported 44 young scholars and produced several volumes of innovative scholarship, including books and special issues of top-ranked specialty journals in the field. The current project seeks to build on these successes. To advance the science of broadening participation, the project will pursue two closely interrelated goals: First, it will expand the scope of collaborative projects that improve our understanding of the interrelationships among race/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice. Second, it will advance the research and professional development of young scholars in this branch of the STEM pipeline, including graduate students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Achieving Project Goals <br/>The PIs will hold additional SRIs for underrepresented faculty and advanced graduate students to enhance their research achievements and success in the academy. The institutes will provide a constructive environment that supports, trains, and mentors young and aspiring faculty in the completion of papers/proposals for journal publication or grant review, offer a tool-kit of information for survival in the university, and reduce isolation of young scholars. In the long run, these activities will contribute to a critical mass of scholars from underrepresented groups whose work is visibly placed, and whose presence and success encourages students-of-color, women, etc. to pursue research and teaching careers. Summer workshops, held separately, will enable participants to develop collaborative projects in the field. These workshops will provide scholars from different disciplines, backgrounds, and career stages with the means to develop, report, and improve on on-going research. Workshops will also support the broadening participation activities of the SRI, especially by integrating underrepresented junior scholars into an energetic network of scholars. Institutes and workshops will also focus direct attention on contemporary issues such as Housing, Lending Patterns and Crime; Race, Crime and Justice in Comparative and International Contexts; and Youth, Peer Culture, and Criminal Justice.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This project has the potential for broader impact in multiple areas. First, the central premise of this work is that the complexity of social relations, including race/ethnicity, shapes our understanding of crime and criminal justice. Participants employ collaborative, multi-method, multi-disciplinary and comparative studies. Findings may improve our understanding of how racialization relates to our understanding of citizenship and democracy, nationally and around the world. Thus, findings may be of interests to the law enforcement and social service providers, urban planners, the law enforcement and policy communities, as well as the general public. Second, the project draws on the expertise of diverse scholars to carry out innovative crime and justice research and purposely seeks to broaden participation in the field by fostering the careers of scholars from underrepresented groups. The workshops and SRIs will enhance not only future research but also training and curricula in criminology and criminal justice fields."

People find it difficult to interact with people from other racial groups, because they are concerned with appearing prejudiced or with experiencing prejudice from others. People often perform worse on memory and decision tasks after they interact with people of a different ethnicity, because of regulatory depletion -- a decrease in people's ability to control their thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. The more people try to regulate some aspects of their behavior (e.g., expressions of prejudice), the less able they are to regulate other aspects (e.g., focus on the evidence). Yet studies show that, when White jurors deliberate with minority (versus only White) jurors to judge a minority defendant, they actually remember more case facts and are more accurate. This study will test the effects of interracial deliberations and defendant race (i.e., White or African-American) on jurors' cognitive performance and motivation to reach a fair verdict, guided by the hypothesis that jurors' motivation to avoid racial prejudice in verdicts encourages them to perform their duty as jurors well even when the social interactions are depleting. Such research, which increases understanding of the interpersonal and cognitive processes at the heart of jury deliberations, can inform courts, policy makers, and the public, and better explain jurors' verdict decisions and inform court practices. Results can be used to influence policy recommendations about how to maximize the benefits of diversity by reducing depletion in the jury room.<br/><br/>Specifically, the proposed experimental research relies on social psychological theories of self-regulation to test a model of group deliberation processes to investigate the effects of ethnic diversity on jury decisions. The strength model of self regulation states that people have limited abilities to regulate their behavior, thoughts, and emotions; therefore, regulatory efforts result in cognitive depletion and diminished performance. Using a self-regulation perspective, the proposed research promises to reconcile two sets of contradictory findings: (a) people are depleted after interacting with individuals from other racial groups (Richeson & Shelton, 2003; Richeson & Trawalter, 2005); (b) mixed-race juries are less racially biased and more thoughtful than all-White juries when they judge an African-American defendant (Bowers, Steiner, & Sandys, 2001; Sommers, 2006). What explains this discrepancy? The present project tests several hypotheses: (a) interracial deliberations are more depleting than racially homogeneous ones; (b) White jurors will be particularly depleted when they have to judge an African American defendant in the presence of African American jurors; but (c) White jurors' motivation to avoid being prejudiced against an African-American defendant (particularly when they deliberate with African-American jurors) would overcome their depletion and ensure they perform their jury task well. In a mock jury deliberation paradigm, juries will include 4 participants and either 2 White or 2 African American confederates, resulting in all-White or mixed juries. Jurors will view evidence from a trial in which the defendant will be presented as either White or African American. Jurors will be instructed about the law, then render individual verdicts, deliberate to reach consensus, and complete measures of regulatory depletion (i.e., Stroop test), memory, motivation to reach a fair verdict, implicit and explicit motivation to avoid prejudice, and impressions of other jurors. Videotaped deliberations will be coded to investigate jurors' focus on evidence and valuable contributions as a function of jury composition and defendant race."

While understanding the patterns of human biological variation is essential to revealing population structure, demographic history and the trajectory of modern human evolution, such categorization, even if based on biological differences, is contentious given its past association with concepts of ""race"" and related ideological agendas. Within physical anthropology, criticisms of the ""race concept"" and anxieties over scientific racism have generated concerns regarding the validity of any study that uses morphological variation as a way to explore evolutionary relationships among human groups. It is argued that any biological information captured by concepts of ""race"", ""ethnicity"" or ""geographic ancestry"" is necessarily confounded by personal beliefs and flawed methodologies and that, in turn, it is impossible to achieve an unbiased explanation of human variation. A tension exists, therefore, between those biological anthropologists who use craniometric variation as a means to access past population structure in phenotypic distance studies or to estimate individual ancestry in forensic contexts, and those who associate any discussions of group differentiation with racial typing. New genetic research on the interaction between culture and biology suggests, however, that there are alternative methods that can be explored in skeletal studies for scientifically detecting group differences and determining the statistical and practical significance of demographic information. Recent genomic work has successfully applied model based clustering to autosomal microsatellite loci in large, world-wide samples, and has identified clusters which closely corresponded to major geographic regions, ethno-culturally identifiable groups, and even admixed populations. These results show the feasibility of population classification by continental ancestry as well as the importance of ""race"", ""ethnicity"" and ""ancestry"" information to studies of population structure. The central question remains therefore: can similar nested hierarchical sub-structuring, or ""population clusters"", be revealed from phenotypic, and specifically, craniometric data using modern human samples? This project applies model based clustering, geometric morphometry, and traditional multivariate statistics to the W.W. Howells and T. Hanihara world-wide craniometric datasets and large Medieval Danish cemetery samples from the Anthropological Data Base Odense University (ADBOU) collection. Traditional linear measurements, trussed inter-landmark distance values, and three-dimensional coordinate data are used (1) to test the efficacy of these new and potentially more powerful quantitative approaches to understanding population-based differences in craniofacial shape and (2) to investigate the statistical significance of among and within-group discrimination using craniofacial measurements. This project also explores the evidentiary relevance of estimating ""geographic ancestry"" and its relationship to ""race"" using craniometrics in forensic and medico-legal contexts and the practical value of the classification results produced given current Daubert standards for expert testimony with the addition of modern American samples drawn from the University of Tennessee's Forensic Anthropology Data Bank (FDB) and demographics from the United States Census 2000.<br/><br/>The association of clusters with geographic regions, ethno-cultural groups, and admixed populations has significant disciplinary and socio-political implications. This research will demonstrate the potential of population classification by continental ancestry and weigh the importance of ""race"", ""ethnicity"" and ""ancestry"" information to studies of population structure. It will also provide recommendations for improved statistical methodologies for geographic ancestry estimation and for the evidentiary significance of estimating ancestry in forensic anthropological and medico-legal contexts given current Daubert standards for scientific evidence. The craniofacial measurements obtained for this study will offer an opportunity to address questions of human biological variation, and specifically the quantification of world-wide craniometric diversity. In testing the statistical effects of combining mixture modeling with traditional and geometric morphometrics and the applicability of clustering algorithms to questions of among and within-population classification, this research will contribute to quantitative applications in anthropology. Moreover, in making new three-dimensional craniometric information from the Anthropological Data Base Odense University (ADBOU) collection available for future morphometric research, this project will not only advance the broader study of ""shape"" but will also increase our knowledge of the life history of these past Danish peoples, thus facilitating studies in areas of concern to skeletal biologists, population geneticists, bioarchaeologists and demographers alike and supporting additional inter-collegiate collaborations. As the raw data and the statistical computer code written for this study will be made freely accessible to other scholars, this project will encourage future researchers to investigate the methodology here employed (therefore prompting refinements to the theories addressed by this project and improvements to our scientific methods) and bring new and different questions to bear on the resources that made this project possible."

This project considers the effects of the Arab Spring revolutions on minority populations, taking as a case study the Amazigh (Berber) populations of Libya and Tunisia. The urgency associated with this RAPID proposal results from the immediacy of the displacement of the Libyan Berbers and the unknowns about how soon the situation may change. The project focuses on the women and the elderly who are central, albeit overlooked, actors in the construction and maintenance of local and transnational ethnic identities. The informal settlement of Libyan refugees into Tunisia - in rural community-volunteered housing and private Tunisian homes - means that laypeople rather than aid workers are managing much of the integration of this displaced population. Refugees from western Libya and their southern Tunisian hosts are Imazighen (Berbers), speaking the Tamazight language and sharing both customs and longstanding discrimination by their respective states. <br/><br/>Whereas scholarship on indigenous people such as North Africa's Imazighen has long focused on their rootedness in ancestral lands, this project asks instead how indigenous groups transform in contexts of displacement. The research will focus on the everyday material and discursive practices in the work and socializing of women and the elderly. Data collection in southern Tunisia will include life histories, participant observation, interviews, and discourse analysis to document over time the shifts in strategies used by refugees to organize their economic and social lives in exile and to mark similarity with and distinctiveness from their hosts. This qualitative study of individuals and families will be complemented by data collection from the UNHCR and relief agencies and will be useful to relief organizations, policymakers, and scholars."

Focusing on Hindu and Sikh communities and advocacy organizations serving these groups in Toronto, Vancouver, New York/New Jersey, and northern California, this project is being conducted both through interviews and analysis of available information about the organizations. The PI will complete interviews with community activists, other members who are closely involved with the community, and with academic experts. The PI will also conduct an analysis of newspaper and media articles, materials produced by the advocacy organizations, and materials discussing differences in opportunity structures and the characteristics of the two groups in North America. This research will contribute to a better understanding of why diasporic groups in different countries might or might not support particular types of long-distance nationalism. Ethnic nationalism and inter-group tensions can also lead to violence in host countries and is of concern to Western states, as well. More broadly, this project will reveal the factors shaping the very different patterns of civic activism and integration of immigrant groups from religious minority backgrounds.<br/><br/><br/>This project contributes to civic incorporation and social movement theories by examining the reasons for the differential mobilization of two important religious minority groups--individuals of Hindu and Sikh background. Hindus and Sikhs have broadly similar patterns of migration to the U.S. and Canada and have close ties with their compatriots across the border, but manifest divergent political activism profiles both within and between the two countries. Dominant paradigms of social incorporation emphasize the opportunity structure of the host country or the characteristics of groups in explaining differences in involvement. However, neither paradigm can satisfactorily explain both inter-country differences between the mobilization of varying religious groups in Canada and the United States and the intra-country differences between the public visibility and activism of the two groups. This research aims to uncover the factors that influence the form that mobilization takes. The study of ""negative cases"" (the relative lack of mobilization of Hindus in Canada and Sikhs and Sri Lankan Tamils in the U.S.) will help to clarify the relationships between the different factors shaping civic involvement and integration. Some scholars have argued that there has been a shift in group mobilization patterns over time from class, to race/ethnicity, to religion, based on research on Muslims in Europe. This project demonstrates, however, that the global resurgence of religion does not necessarily mean that individuals from the same religious background with group-based grievances will mobilize around a public religious identity. The study examines how different political opportunity structures (both national and local) and differences in the characteristics of the groups shape how they frame their grievances and mobilize."

Broadly stated, these questions consider: 1) the role that gender and gender-specific parenting practices may play in the development of empathy in young children, and 2) the differences and similarities that may be observed in empathic development among children living in low income families across three subcultures within the U. S., namely European-American, Mexican-American, and African-American. The objective is to enable data analyses that elucidate the developmental pathways of males and females in relation to earlier emotional development, parenting experiences, family ecology, and ethnicity by scoring videotaped responses of children to distress simulations that were identically conducted in the two of the three studies. This project extends knowledge of operant processes in emotional development of males and females including socialization of empathy. It will provide new insights into cross-ethnic similarities and differences in early emotional development. Each study makes a unique contribution to the investigation of empathic development.<br/>The three studies are longitudinal, beginning observational assessments of children's emotion regulation as young as age six months and assessing mothers' attitudes and the ecology of her living circumstances as early as pregnancy. Observation of empathy began as early as 18 months. Two studies are part of a program of research on the impact of early nurse home visitation on family development. The first study, the New Mothers Study was conducted in Memphis, TN, where the enrolled sample of 739 women was almost entirely African-American. The second study, Home Visitation 2000 (HV2000) was conducted in Denver, CO where two-thirds of the 735 enrolled women were either Mexican-American or African-American. All women in both samples had low incomes at the time of enrollment, during pregnancy, and were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. <br/>Observations of the Memphis children were gathered when they completed kindergarten; their responses to story beginnings that permitted the incorporation of empathic themes were videotaped. In Memphis, questions concerning the antecedents of empathy will focus on the role of gender in the experience of African-American children in relation to early and concurrent contextual risk, empathic maternal attitudes, and maternal reports of temperament and behavior problems. <br/>Observations of the HV2000 children's response to empathy-eliciting distress simulations occurred at 21, 24, and 48 months of age. Observations of the children's reactivity to laboratory-based emotion challenges were conducted at 6, 15, and 24 months of age. Questions concerning antecedents of empathic development in HV2000 will concentrate on the role of gender and ethnicity in continuities in early emotion regulation styles with later empathic responses. In addition, questions will be addressed concerning early antecedents in contextual risk factors, mother-child relationship, and maternal report of temperament and behavior problems.<br/>The third study includes a low-income sample of 309 children enrolled before their first birthday in a study of Early Head Start (EHS) interventions. The ethnic sample distribution is similar to that of HV2000. Observations of empathic responses to distress simulations were conducted at 18, 30, and 36 months of age. Observed emotion regulation began when children were eight months old utilizing similar procedures as in the HV2000 study and were repeated at 18 and 30 months. A unique opportunity of this study is to replicate findings from the HV2000 sample and examine the role of two additional features: 1) the role of family routines and 2) early language skills. In all three studies, treatment status will be incorporated into analytic models and retained as a factor as needed.<br/>The products of the proposed investigations will include a series of peer-reviewed papers that consider findings from each of these samples independently and a final monograph in which the material is synthesized across studies."

A number of scholars contend that Mexican immigrants and their children face limited prospects for successful economic and socio-cultural incorporation into the middle-class, and that Mexican immigrants and their children are prime candidates for downward mobility into a minority underclass culture. On the other hand, immigrants who achieve upward mobility are expected to incorporate into the white middle-class. However, some scholars have recently theorized that upwardly mobile immigrants and their children, like Mexicans, may incorporate into a minority middle-class culture. The goal of this study is to examine the trajectories of upwardly mobile Mexicans to determine whether they are incorporating as middle-class whites or as middle-class minorities. The research studies three distinct measures of incorporation: patterns of giving back to coethnics; participation in voluntary associations among the Mexican middle-class; and racial/ethnic identification. To answer the research questions at hand, the study draws on multiple methods: in-depth structured interviews with members of the Mexican-origin middle-class; participant and nonparticipant observation of a Latina professional organization; and analysis of the National Survey of Family and Households.<br/><br/>This study contributes to both the immigration and race/ethnicity literatures in a number of important ways. First, the research remedies the shortcoming in Portes and Zhou's (1993) theory of segmented assimilation, and also tests Neckerman, Carter, and Lee's (1999) theory of the minority culture of mobility that proposes that immigrants and their children may take multiple pathways into the middle-class. Second, the research examines whether the Mexican-origin middle-class displays patterns of giving back that mirror the collectivist orientation exhibited by African Americans, or whether they more closely resemble the individualistic orientation exhibited by middle-class whites. Third, the research goes beyond the study of second-generation adolescents and focuses on adults. Finally, the study moves beyond the traditional binary black/white paradigm by examining the racial/ethnic identity options and constraints among Mexicans in the United States, who identity neither as simply black nor white. More broadly, the study will provide insight into the economic and sociocultural incorporation processes of one and a half, second, and later generations of the Mexican origin middle-class population. The study has relevance for public policy since it offers an in-depth understanding of a population that is often touted as unassimalable, vulnerable to downward mobility, and likely to remain poor for generations to come."

Finley, supervised by Dr. Peter J. Brown, will undertake anthropological research on how men's experiences with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and other post-deployment stresses are shaped by ethnicity, family support, and military service. She will compare how Anglo- and Mexican-American male veterans of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan understand and respond to the stresses of deployment and the return to civilian life. The central research question is: how and to what degree are post-war trauma and distress shaped by the social and cultural environments in which they occur? While there has been considerable epidemiological research on the causes of PTSD, there still are questions remaining about how risk factors are mediated by social and cultural variables. Anthropological ethnographic methods are particularly well suited to filling that gap.<br/><br/>The researcher will carry out the research in the Tejeda clinic, which is overseen by the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in San Antonio, Texas. San Antonio has large concentrations of veterans, military bases, and hospitals serving veterans. It is also a region where a large proportion of the population self-identifies as Mexican-American. Research methods will include participating in the lives of veterans and their families and a series of semi-structured interviews using tested survey instruments, for a sample of 160 veterans and family members, as well as a smaller sample of clinicians and community members. She also will gather data with standard checklists, scales, and questionnaires. The goal is to understand how veterans, families, clinicians, and fellow community members make sense of military and civilian life, and how these understandings are shaped by ethnicity, ideas about masculinity, and levels of PTSD-related or other psychological distress. <br/><br/>This research will contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist. It also will contribute to developing social science theory about the complex relationships between individual and group experience, on the one hand, and social and cultural norms, on the other. It also will provide insight into how best to support veterans and their families of different ethnic groups following combat deployment."

And how can our understanding of this promote better ways of teaching geographic concepts in the lower grades? These two questions serve as the primary objectives for this study. In addressing the first question, the study will show the ways in which children conceptualize space as socially constructed through human actions, flows and movement, social relationships, and physical processes. The project will also demonstrate the ways that children play active roles in shaping social space, constructing meaningful places, and representing spatial relationships through various age-appropriate media. The research will engage third-grade classrooms from two urban neighborhood schools in Buffalo, New York to help identify and theorize a ""children's urban geography"". The study adopts the view that children are active, knowing, and purposeful agents through and upon space who -- like the rest of society -- are constrained by factors of their age, race/ethnicity, class, and gender. In the two schools chosen for this study over 90% of the children are living in poverty. Additionally, the children come from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds: one school is overwhelmingly African-American and the other serves a mixed neighborhood of Hispanics, whites, and Native Americans. A service-learning course will be taught by the Principal Investigator at the University at Buffalo that will enable Geography and Education students to participate in much of the research while simultaneously themselves learning about inner-city schools, geographic concepts, teaching strategies, and research processes. Research methods will include participant observation, informal interviews with children, and analysis of children's artwork, games, and stories to learn more about how children understand and represent social and physical urban space. At the same time, the development of curriculum materials appropriate for teaching geographic concepts will be developed by the Principal Investigator in concert with the University students, and tested in the third-grade classrooms. Emphasis in both the research and the development of curriculum materials is on using both traditional materials (paper, paint, glue) and multi-media such as videography, web site development, computer map-making, communication with distant classrooms, and display of creative projects by the children (art, maps, stories, and others) on each class's web site.<br/><br/>The significance of this study lies in several areas. First, the theoretical gap in the geography on children's understandings of space will be filled. Further, the discipline may one day benefit from greater ethnic/racial diversity if some of these young children choose to continue with their geographic education at higher levels and become practitioners in one way or another. Second, the project will be a bridge between the University and the local community and will foster greater exchange of ideas between impoverished schools and resource-rich educational establishments. Third, the project will expose Geography students to the possibilities of elementary education as a career option and will expose Education students to the wealth of geographic concepts that can form an important part of education in the lower grades. Further, these students will gain experience in racially diverse, low-income schools, participate in research for both theoretical and practical purposes, and experience the rewards of interacting with young children as part of community service. Fourth, the participating schools and classroom teachers will receive the use of computers, software, and other equipment that otherwise would be unobtainable, as well as teacher training in high technology, digital media, and geographic software. The teachers will also have new curriculum materials to use for the New York State-mandated third-grade focus on ""communities"". And finally, the children who participate in the project will benefit from availability of high-quality computers in their classrooms and structured use of the Internet, from engagement with University students who can serve as role models, and from the heightened self-esteem that comes from being recognized as important and valuable members of the research project."

Political liberalization, technological advances, and market reforms have made television, FM radio, newspapers, and the Internet available over increasingly large swaths of territory in Africa. As a result, millions are finding it easier and cheaper to access entertainment, information from diaspora communities, and, perhaps most importantly, news about politics in their country. Social scientists have only begun studying how these new developments in communication and information exchange are affecting citizens' knowledge about politics and, consequently, political competition in the region. This research project seeks to understand, more specifically, how recent developments in African mass media have affected citizens' electoral decision-making processes. Dominant theories of voting behavior in Africa focus heavily on factors such as ethnic identities and candidates' distribution of relatively cheap goods during campaign periods. However, does the increasing availability of information, such as journalistic accounts of official corruption, government distributional practices, and policy outcomes, affect the salience of these factors in voters' decision-making calculi? This project develops a theory of information-collection strategies and electoral decision-making in Sub-Saharan Africa that attributes some of the importance of factors such as ethnicity and goods distribution to the political information that they provide to voters. The theory posits that, as other, possibly confounding facts about politics become more widely available, the importance of these other factors, such as ethnicity and goods distribution, in voters' decision-making processes will decline. In order to examine the validity of these hypotheses, a series of laboratory experiments will be conducted in a number of locations in Uganda. Subjects will be exposed to various types of information about hypothetical two-candidate races for local government positions. Following these informational treatments, which will include cues such as candidates' educational levels, past performance as elected officials, and positions on controversial local issues, participants' levels of support for and evaluations of co-ethnics and goods distributors will be measured. These experiments will result in the creation of a dataset on which theories on voting behavior in Sub-Saharan Africa can be tested. The findings of this research should improve our understanding of how variations in access to political information affect outcomes such as inter-ethnic relations, clientelistic exchange, and electoral competition in Sub-Saharan Africa, and other developing democracies as well."

Research has shown that the web enables individuals to engage with information selectively. Selective engagement occurs when individuals retrieve news that speaks their political preferences, and ignore information that clashes with already existing opinions. Using panel survey data and an experimental design, the study examines whether the same underlying mechanism that allows citizens to sort themselves into highly partisan information worlds online (via selective exposure to information) also enables members of historically disadvantaged groups to efficiently access information that pertains specifically to them and to their groups' political goals. Moreover, the project addresses whether selective exposure to online news could provide political knowledge gains among minority populations that may translate into better representation by the political system. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is associated with its three main objectives: (1) to examine how partisanship, ideology, race and ethnicity, as well as group consciousness, influence selective exposure to political information online; (2) to research how selective exposure affects the quality, quantity and strength of political attitudes; (3) to test the impact of selective exposure on political participation and the quality of vote choice. The project employs a multi-method approach to address these objectives. In the first and completed phase of the research, panel data were analyzed to test the role of race/ethnicity in moderating the effects of online news consumption and subsequent attitude change using generalized linear mixed models. Phase II of the research will add an experiment to test what news African-American, Caucasian and Latino subjects select when they are exposed to different information environments, and how news selection impacts the quality, quantity and strength of political attitudes, as well as various forms of participation. The experiment tracks what news sources subjects select, how much time they spend with each news source, how much information they recall, and how news selection impacts opinion and the quality of their choices.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are related to representation and citizenship. Access to information is a critical prerequisite for the realization of full citizenship, and marginalized groups have historically been served poorly by mainstream media. Minorities may therefore stand to gain the most from the vast information found on the web. By examining the role of ethnicity, race and partisanship in the selection of information, and by researching the subsequent development of political knowledge and attitudes, as well as political participation, this research speaks to scholarship in political communications, political psychology, and race and politics. The data generated in this experiment will also be made available to other researchers. The data and findings will be of interest to scholars who are researching information, participation and representation."

If, as many experts argue, political participation in Africa is a continuation of cultural and historical patronage linkages between politicians and citizens, democracy, especially voting, is mere window dressing. If politicians pay voters to turn out and vote for them, or if they persuade co-ethnics to vote for them with promises of enrichment and prosperity once elected, citizens may be free, but their country is not a competitive democracy. This dissertation examines voting behavior, including why citizens turnout and who they vote for, in nine Sub-Saharan African democracies. While conventional wisdom suggests that ethnicity and clientelism explain voting in Africa, individual-level evidence suggests that these explanations may not predict turnout and choice in African democracies. Voting behavior in Africa is addressed using two methodologies, structured experiments and analysis of cross-national survey data. <br/><br/>The most innovative aspect of this project is the use of experimental research techniques to understand voting behavior in Africa. This experiment uses a game commonly employed in economic experiments, the Ultimatum Game, to examine how individuals choose between alternatives that represent competing theories of vote choice in Africa, including ethnicity, vote buying, corruption, and accountability. It extends the work of Inman and Andrews (2008), which finds that citizens are more likely to participate when they perceive their government as corrupt. Thus, accountability plays a much greater role than traditional theory would suggest. With results from experiments carried out in Senegal and Ghana, it will be possible to investigate both turnout and vote choice at the individual level, in particular, how an individual's voting behavior is influenced by their evaluation of governmental performance, as opposed to traditional factors such as ethnic ties. Survey results from nine African democracies and country-level factors, such as length of democracy, will be used to examine voting behavior, as well as to validate the experimental results. In combination, these methodologies will provide a rich picture of voting behavior in Africa's emerging democracies.<br/><br/>This work has broader implications for the study of modernization and democratization. Democratization has been slow to take hold in most African countries. Przeworski and Limongi (1997) find that democracy is almost never sustained in poor, underdeveloped countries. Given that most African countries can be characterized as poor and underdeveloped (e.g. see Easterly and Levine 1997), the weight of empirical evidence suggests that democracy will not be sustained in Africa. Yet, some African countries have made democratic transitions successfully, despite the predictions of the modernization theory of democracy. While these transitions have been studied at the institutional and elite level (e.g. Bratton and van de Walle 1997, Villalon and VonDoepp 2005), little attention has been paid to the role that citizens play in maintaining stable democracies. This project will evaluate the extent to which citizens make voting decisions based on evaluations of governmental performance, which may be directly related to the willingness of citizens to continue accepting the authority of democratic governments. One of the basic predictions of modernization theory is that education provides citizens the cognitive capacity to hold their leaders accountable. To the extent that Africans hold their leaders accountable, even without the resources and skills that modernization theory would predict, we have a basis of comparison between voters in non-industrialized and industrialized countries. Thus, the project has the potential to enhance understanding of voting behavior in industrialized vs. non-industrialized countries."

Marginalized regions have sought to balance development with preservation of their distinctiveness, all within a post-industrial economy that paradoxically values difference while facilitating homogenization. This research suggests that while negotiating these conflicting goals and values, both residents of a region and tourists from outside engage in complex performances of ""social spatialization"" whereby they give particular meanings to place. In Louisiana's Acadiana region attempts to preserve the region's culture and environment through cultural and eco-tourism have been accompanied by considerable political contestation. Though historically this region was socially and environmentally marginalized, the last forty years have seen a resurgence of ethnic recognition and a growing interest in protecting the local wetland environment. Today, the Atchafalaya River Basin is characterized in a variety of ways as a space of natural resources, wilderness, tourism and ethnic heritage. These imagined attributes of place are constructed through a melding of representations about a place and subjective experiences in a place. In order to assess these conjectures, the research will compare qualitative findings from three major sources: literature and popular media; public scoping and interviews; and the experience of a variety of swamp tours. <br/><br/>The study will give insight into how Cajun ethnicity is negotiated in the swamp for visitors and how this notion of the Atchafalaya compares to local and representational knowledges. Results will inform contribute to the literature that investigates the increased prominence of place-marketing as an economic development strategy in historically marginalized regions. This study also hopes to reinvigorate interest in Cajun culture so that researchers can better address issues such as language loss, disinvestment, and cultural commodification in the region. Analysis will reveal the ways in which individuals involved in tourism construct and articulate the place myths that undergird this economy. The findings will inform guides, planners, and anyone interested in environmental and cultural preservation in Acadiana or elsewhere. The award will enable a promising student to improve his dissertation research and to establish a strong independent research career."

The<br/>center's diverse collection of scholars and focus on mixed methods will allow for the<br/>exploration of both quantitative and qualitative data in the study of the racial socialization<br/>process.<br/>One of the largest unresolved questions about racial socialization concerns how<br/>parent?s messages are communicated to and received by adolescents. Racial socialization<br/>studies have largely used either parent or child reports of racial socialization, a practice that<br/>precludes analysis of the relation between parent and child reports of racial socialization or a<br/>thorough examination of the reasons behind successful communication of messages.<br/>These discrepancies between parent and child reports of racial socialization are<br/>noteworthy and merit further investigation for at least three reasons. First, an understanding<br/>of the discrepancies can be used to help parents to talk to their children about race in ways<br/>that enhance youths' identity and self-esteem. Ineffective communication about race and<br/>ethnicity on the part of parents may undermine the protective functions such communication<br/>is intended to serve. Second, advancement in this literature may help<br/>mental health professionals and community leaders to further refine interventions and social<br/>programs that help parents to talk to their children about race in productive ways. This<br/>research will lead to evidence-based interventions and programs that improve mental health<br/>and academic outcomes for ethnic minority adolescents. Third,<br/>explaining the gap will link the racial socialization literature with a broader socialization<br/>literature that has already grappled with discrepancies between parent and child reports of<br/>socialization.<br/>An initial goal of the proposed research is to explore how parent and adolescent<br/>reports differ on three aspects of racial socialization: messages stressing group differences<br/>and racial bias; messages that teach children about their culture; and messages stressing<br/>distrust between racial groups. The proposed research will also examine how racial<br/>socialization is affected by the broader context of parenting, including parenting style and<br/>family functioning. Finally, the project seeks to broaden understanding of the racial<br/>socialization process by examining the full range of contexts in which race socialization<br/>occurs. Increasing knowledge of the race socialization process will inform interventions that<br/>promote healthy conversations about race between parents and children.<br/>During the time at the CRDCE, the fellow will collaborate with an interdisciplinary<br/>team of scholars, including many minority researchers. The proposed activity consists of<br/>research projects, seminars, and coursework that will enhance the fellow?s understanding of<br/>ecological and developmental influences on the race socialization process. The fellow will<br/>also enhance his knowledge of research methods by taking courses and consulting with<br/>scholars on qualitative, mixed, and observational methods. The fellowship will also allow for<br/>the potential fellow to work on at least three first authored publications and to work on other<br/>papers at the center. The fellow's time at the center will provide increased preparation for a<br/>tenure track position at a research university."

The public, policy makers, and researchers agree that concerted efforts to improve the educational outcomes of children in low-income families are required to further develop their potential to become productive citizens. Concern is particularly warranted for the achievement levels of racial/ethnic minority children in poverty. National studies show that differences in family income account for over half of the differences among Black and White children in IQ scores. Black and Latino children are exposed to particularly high levels of economic disadvantage, as well as differential treatment in school and other settings.<br/><br/>Issues of race, poverty, income and school performance take on a special urgency due to rapidly changing federal, state and local policy climates for low-income families. Welfare reform policies, following passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193), have produced profound changes in government incentives to move low -income parents off welfare and into work. The federal Children's Initiative has urged researchers to examine effects of variation in welfare reform policies on children (Office of Science and Technology Policy, 1997).<br/><br/>The current study examines how changes in income and employment might affect children's school performance differently for Black, Latino, and White families. The study aims to explore multiple mediating pathways through which changes in income and employment may affect children's school performance. The samples are drawn from 5 experimental welfare reform and anti-poverty policy programs, which have demonstrated short-term rises in income and employment, and which incorporate follow-up assessments of child school performance. The data will afford a rare opportunity to examine changes in income and employment which have been experimentally manipulated, rather than determined primarily by prior family selection factors.<br/><br/>The objectives of this study are threefold. First, it aims to answer the question: Do changes in income and employment in early childhood affect middle-childhood school performance differently for Black, Latino, and White single-parent families on welfare? Second, the study aims to explore differences among these groups in multiple mediating pathways through which effects of changes in income and employment on school performance may occur. Areas included are informed by psychosocial, lifespan, ecological, and human capital theories of child development, and encompass two principal microsystems, or proximal settings, of development (the home and child care settings). The mediators encompass child care use, including quantity and type; marriage; parenting practices, including authoritative parenting and cognitive stimulation; and parent aspirations for their children's school success. Differences in kind and strength of mediated relationships are hypothesized, depending on racial/ethnic group. Third, the question of how dimensions in current welfare and anti-poverty policy moderate these direct and mediated effects will be explored. Three primary dimensions across which current welfare reform programs differ are chosen for investigation: time limits, generosity of financial incentives (earnings disregards and supplements), and mandated employment-related activities.<br/><br/>The study utilizes data sets from programs which test approaches to encouraging employment and raising family income through anti-poverty and welfare reform policy. The programs differ considerably on the three policy dimensions, and reflect the current range of TANF programs. They cover a wide geographic range, including samples from four state policy contexts (Minnesota, California, Florida, and Connecticut). Moreover, the data sets incorporate subgroups of Black, Latino and White families of large enough size to enable comparisons of mediating pathways. The analyses proposed are distinct from the overall experimental impacts which have been and will be reported in the main evaluation reports for these programs. The study thus presents a unique opportunity to examine race/ethnicity-specific developmental effects of income and employment in the contexts of experimental designs, and variation in welfare and anti-poverty policy."

Modern citizenship denotes membership in a political community and the rights and responsibilities attached to that membership. It also denotes membership in a national community defined by cultural norms, values, and ethnocultural markers. Those deemed unassimilable in the national community often lack full, substantive access to the rights and privileges enjoyed by dominant groups. Thus, universalistic conceptions of citizenship exist in tension, to varying degrees, with the de facto marginalization or exclusion of particular groups. Estonia has seen growing social and political divisions between the ethnic Estonian majority and the large Russian minority since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. With its accession to the European Union in 2004, Estonia expressed its commitment to Europe's post-national political project. In practice, however, the EU's directives regarding multiculturalism and minority rights have coexisted uneasily with Estonia's post-Soviet nation-building prerogatives. This project will study the politics of citizenship in Estonia from the perspective of secondary school students in Tallinn, Estonia's largest and most ethnically mixed city. Schools traditionally are key sites of citizenship formation, and the doctoral student will explore how educators and administrators as well as EU youth-policy makers articulate and implement particular citizenship ideals and national narratives through school curricula. She will explore how current secondary school students (part of the first wholly post-Soviet generation in Estonia) interpret, respond to, and act upon the citizenship narratives that they learn in school as well as how their experiences within and outside of school inform their understandings of citizenship and belonging in Estonia. To explore these issues, she will conduct focus groups with students in seven secondary schools, including schools that are predominantly Estonian, that are predominantly Russian, and that have mixed ethnicity. Focus group participants will participate in mapping exercises and a walking tour of Tallinn's controversial memorial sites and monuments, the purpose of which is to explore how young people's understandings of citizenship and their sense of belonging are informed by, and shaped within, material spaces within and beyond the school.<br/><br/>The results of this research will enhance basic understanding of citizenship as sets of political discourses, policies, and practices that people encounter in their everyday lives. This research will demonstrate how citizenship, while often conceived of in universalistic terms, has uneven meanings or outcomes, both spatially and socially. The project will shed new light on the role of young people as political actors, illuminating the ways they engage in the politics of citizenship even as they may be excluded from formal modes of political participation. In doing so, the project will bring together the fields of youth geography and civic education, and it will help focus attention on schools as key sites of citizenship formation and negotiation. This project also will contribute to current discussions about ethnonational politics in the former Soviet Union and will help clarify tensions between EU norms and nation-building projects in post-communist states. Project results will help inform discussions about divided societies, providing important insights into the role of youth and education policies in addressing ethnonational tensions in divided societies. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

Reviews of convictions and sentencing in actual cases, and findings from trial simulation experiments, provide evidence of discrimination against minorities. National polls and media stories reveal that prejudice remains prevalent in America. But research has provided little insight into how prejudice operates in the courtroom and has not identified critical factors that increase or decrease discrimination. Through a series of experiments involving trial simulations, the project seeks better theoretical understanding of how and when a defendant's race/ethnicity influences jury decisions. It also aims to identify interventions that lessen courtroom bias, thereby providing policy and practice suggestions to the legal community. These are important undertakings in a diverse society that seeks equal justice for all. <br/><br/>Eight trial simulation experiments will be conducted in which Black, Hispanic, and White jury-eligible citizens serve as mock-jurors. They will provide verdict preferences and other impressions after reviewing a trial in which the defendant is a member of either their racial/ethnic group (an ""ingroup"" defendant) or one of the other groups (an ""outgroup"" defendant). In some experiments, mock-jurors will also deliberate. Social-psychological theory guides the research and offers a framework for integrating diverse findings from sociology, criminal justice, criminology, and psychology. Based on social-psychological theory, a sense of threat -- to social identity, cultural worldview, or security -- should increase discrimination in the form of greater perceived guilt and convictions of outgroup defendants. Prejudice is understood to exist at an unconscious or implicit level, even among many who consciously reject prejudice. To assess the impact of these factors, some experiments examine whether discrimination increases when participant-jurors experience these threats through information encountered prior to the trial. Additional experiments focus on ways to reduce discrimination, including judges' instructions to guard against prejudice and the opportunity to deliberate. Results will inform decision making in the criminal justice system."

For the case of African Americans it will provide new detailed information about the trend toward increasing residential segregation that accompanied the Great Migration from the South. To what extent did individual socioeconomic mobility translate into living in more integrated or higher status neighborhoods for blacks? What was the response of whites to growing black population in certain parts of the city? For the case of European immigrants, the study will shed light on the process of spatial assimilation that has been documented in prior research. Were the earlier arriving groups (Germans, Irish, and British) still segregated from native whites when new groups began to arrive in large numbers? How long did it take for Italians, Russians, and Scandinavians to begin moving out of dense ethnic neighborhoods, and what were the characteristics of people who left or stayed within them? How did these processes vary across cities, based on group size or composition? <br/><br/>The selection of cities for this study makes it possible to analyze both the spatial assimilation and segregation of immigrants, who were highly concentrated in these cities,. With respect to both kinds of minorities the study breaks new ground by studying segregation at a much higher spatial resolution (the enumeration district and census tract) than the ward (which is the basis for most research on segregation). A key comparison is between black-white segregation (believed to be moderate until after 1920 when blacks began moving in large numbers in the Great Migration) and immigrant residential enclaves that are viewed as transitory in nature. This project will offer a critical test of these conclusions and provide some of the first analyses of trends in class segregation. In addition, it will answer questions about the processes of residential change based on spatial analyses of neighborhoods. First, which group members lived in co-ethnic neighborhoods and how did social mobility and acculturation translate into living outside of these enclaves for different groups, in different kinds of cities, and in different decades)? For this purpose neighborhoods will be defined as combinations of enumeration districts based on spatial dependence in social composition. Neighborhoods, then, are expected to vary in location and scale over time as settlement patterns evolve. Second, how do neighborhoods change, particularly in relation to the invasion/succession process that has been documented for much of the 20th Century ? the phenomenon of native (3+ generation) whites deserting neighborhoods when blacks and immigrants began arriving. Were there tipping points of racial and ethnic change in the early decades of the century, and if so did the extent of white native flight differ according to the race and ethnicity of new arrivals?<br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>These questions will be addressed using 100% samples of residents of ten cities in each decade, aggregated to small areas (enumeration districts) and mapped within a GIS system. The data and maps will be made available for public use via a web-based map browser and also shared through direct download. This study is highly relevant to major contemporary social concerns. Black ghettoization anchored patterns of racial segregation, and processes of immigrant spatial assimilation have been renewed as Hispanics and Asians have become the fastest growing population groups in the nation. It is essential to understand the precedents for these processes in order to have realistic expectations about the current situation."

Much research has overlooked the importance of international migrations within the Third World, focusing instead on labor migration from economically less well developed to more developed countries. This research project will examine the abrupt and large population movement of Indians in Tanzania in the period 1960- 1990 as a means of understanding the complex processes of large scale migration within the Third World. The study will highlight how groups of migrants were affected by and responded to geographical differences in social, economic, and political conditions associated with migration. Data from archives in both India and Tanzania will be combined with personal interviews and participant observation of migrants to test hypotheses relating gender, class, caste, age, and family structure to particular migration streams to and within Tanzania. Within the past century, and particularly since the breakup of colonial empires, there have been substantial migrations of people into Africa. One of the most dynamic situations has involved the migration of Asian Indians into and with the country of Tanzania. This project will not only provide documentation of this phenomenon, but it will also explain how such disruptions help to redefine ethnic boundaries, gender relations, and class hierarchies under changing political and economic conditions."

Unfortunately, research in this area has been riddled with theoretical and methodological problems, including narrow conceptualizations of involvement, overdependence on data from father-absent families and samples lacking ethnic and socioeconomic diversity, and over-reliance cross-sectional designs. These shortcomings have limited our understanding of the complexity involved in fathers' approach parental tasks and of how variability in this complexity affects children's learning and development. Inconsistencies in available evidence on the impact of father involvement have further hampered efforts to develop federal ""family supportive"" policies include an appreciation for the unique and diverse roles fathers play in their children's development. The intent of the current project is to overcome many of these limitations. This project will addresses the following research questions: First, how does father involvement in school and home settings vary as a function of child age, family structure, family socioeconomic status, and ethnicity? Second, are higher levels of father involvement in these settings associated with more positive behavioral and academic outcomes for children than lower levels of involvement? Third, is father involvement stable across time? Is the impact of father involvement on children's behavior and academic achievement stable over time? Fourth, does father involvement mediate the impact of school-, neighborhood-, and family-level resources on children? Fifth, what are the antecedents of father involvement in home and school settings, and do these antecedents remain stable across time? Drawing from a nationally representative data base of U. S. children and their families (i.e., the first and second waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement), this project will explore how demographic and behavioral variables are related to paternal involvement in home and school settings, and how parental involvement impacts children's development. In overcoming limitations of previous research in this area, the current study may provide more definitive conclusions than afforded by previous research on the antecedents and characteristics of father involvement and the extent to which differences in these parental characteristics and patterns of involvement influence child development.<br/><br/>Interest in the roles played by fathers in the development of their children has increased dramatically in recent years. This increased interest has been paralleled by a shift in societal expectations for fatherhood. Although extant evidence indicates that some fathers devote more time to caring for their children than was the case in previous generations, these observed increases in involvement are small, and fathers continue to spend significantly less time than mothers caring for children. In addition, neither researchers nor practitioners have a clear understanding of the reasons that some fathers are more involved in their children's care than others whether these reasons differ for different socioeconomic and ethnic groups, or the extent to which differences in paternal involvement affect children's social development and academic achievement. Findings from this study will add to our understanding of the unique ways in which paternal involvement impacts their children's learning and development and will identify the demographic and cultural factors associated with higher levels of father involvement. Information gained from this project will provide a useful framework for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers in the time when families are struggling with changing societal expectations for fathers and parental roles are being refined at both the familial level and the cultural level."

For example, surviving infants of low birth weight are more likely to suffer from learning disabilities and other cognitive problems. Moreover, children of lower socioeconomic status have much poorer birth outcomes on average. To the extent that infant health is compromised by the mother's lack of opportunity, it represents a mechanism for the intergenerational perpetuation of poverty and inequality. This project assembles a new panel of data on infant health using California's Vital Statistics Natality Records for 1982 to 2001. This panel allows them to follow mothers between births in order to answer three outstanding questions about the relationships between human capital, social capital, and the determinants of infant health. <br/>First, how does maternal education affect infant health in a rich country such as the United States? Can spillovers from maternal education to infant health be considered as an additional return to education? Do estimated effects of maternal education differ with socioeconomic status, immigrant status, or race/ethnicity? In order to answer these questions this project compares the infant health outcomes of siblings whose mothers increased their education between births to those whose mothers did not. The project also examines the channels through which increased education improves infant health. Second, can ""network effects"" explain geographical/ethnic correlations in the use of publicly funded maternity care services. Many researchers have noted strong correlations <br/>between behaviors of women in networks defined using geographical and ethnic/racial affiliations, but it is difficult to prove that there is a causal link. A panel of data allows the researchers to control for many unobservable determinants of infant health which have confounded previous non-experimental studies. Moreover this project tests the prevalent hypothesis that estimated network effects reflect shared information. If networks act by transmitting information, then the estimated effects should be larger among mothers who have not previously used public maternity care services, since mothers who have <br/>already experienced the services will know how to access them and do not need to gain this information from networks. The panel permits comparisons of the estimated effects of networks on women who did and did not previously receive the services in order to conduct this test. <br/>The third question is how the implementation of Medicaid managed care in California <br/>has affected access to maternity care services. The construction of the panel enables the project to ask, for example, whether Medicaid mothers who are constrained to join Medicaid managed care organizations become less likely to enroll in Medicaid, use certain hospitals, to receive services, and ultimately to have healthy infants. This project assesses the extent to which an important change in access to health care for low income mothers has played a role in ameliorating or acerbating inequalities due to differentials in health at birth."

Earlier research tended to view children as passive recipients of culture who were socialized into a single adult type. New theories give more emphasis to children as active agents who selectively draw on, and reinterpret, messages from adults. This project, by a cultural anthropologist, adds a cross-cultural dimension to a literature now based largely on studies of American and European children. This is important both for strengthening the case that children actively construct their identities and, by studying how the categories are enacted differently across contexts, for shedding light on the factors that influence the salience of the categories that children use. The research will be conducted in Fiji where the Principal Investigator already has done extensive research on children in rural areas. Now she plans six months of research, between June and December 2006, in Fiji's urban capital, Suva. Because cultural categories such as ethnicity, race, and gender may be more marked in urban contexts, urban children may have less latitude for their own interpretations than rural children do. The principal investigator and her students will live with families of different backgrounds and observe the children and their playmates in a variety of settings. The project fosters the integration of research and education by building on an existing study abroad in Fiji program to give undergraduates an unusual opportunity to participate in anthropological research. The project also supports the development of research capacity at a primarily undergraduate American institution."

Specifically, the research explores the link between Latino descriptive and substantive representation in six state legislatures. This research analyzes how Latino ""interests"" are defined, whether and how those interests are advanced through the legislative process, and how ethnic diversity within a legislature can influence legislative outcomes. Drawing on previous research in race, gender and representation, the project contrasts a descriptive representation model ( in which the ethnicity of a legislator influences behavior even when taking into account constituency and partisanship) with an electoral representation model, in which constituency is the primary motivator of legislator behavior. The major research questions include: Does diversity within legislatures change the behavior of majority individuals? What influence does diversity within legislatures have on policy outcomes? This project will examine these questions in the case of Latino legislators by drawing from previous research on the role of gender and race in the legislative arena. Multiple methods (including regression analysis, content analysis, and network analysis) will be used to examine three main issues. First, ethnic differences in legislative behavior, from the sponsorship stage to the passage stage of the roll-call process, are examined. Second, this project explores whether Latino representatives maximize their influence by building collaborative networks. And third, an examination of whether the increased presence of Latino representatives in a chamber, and increased formal influence, affects individual legislative behavior and legislative outcomes is conducted. A set of data collected from six state legislatures (California, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, and Texas) in 2001 and 2005 is used for this project. This project also includes a significant qualitative component, based on interviews of Latino and non-Latino state legislators from a variety of districts. These interviews are particularly valuable given that many of the relevant issues that make up ""Latino issues"" (such as immigration) are newly placed on the political agenda. The project will contribute to scholarly knowledge by building on prior empirical work on gender, race, and representation. The merit of the project is further enhanced in that it employs multiple methods to explore how the link between descriptive and substantive representation can vary at different stages and under different conditions within legislative institutions."

They are to (1) identify individual-level and contextual determinants of internal migration in Guatemala and (2) measure the economic and social impact of migration on women in rural communities. The project seeks to help us better understand the impact of rural and urban development on the size, composition, and direction of internal migration streams. Also, it will provide insight in the role migration plays in raising rural household incomes and in the diffusion of urban culture.<br/><br/>To address the first objective, the research will analyze the effects of individual <br/>and place characteristics on the probability of recent internal migration, and on the choice of destination in Guatemala. Employment opportunities, amenities, and population pressure will be measured to assess the relative attractiveness of alternative locations. Period trends in lifetime internal migration will be examined for evidence of the effects of political violence on population redistribution. Ethnicity is an important stratifying variable in Guatemalan society: social, cultural and economic differences between indigenous Mayan and the nonindigenous populations are well documented and pervasive. The study will investigate alternative explanations of ethnic differences in migration patterns that make reference to culturally based consumption preferences and economic marginalization.<br/><br/>Secondly, the research will determine the impact of temporary migration and social ties to internal and U.S. migrants, on the size and composition of household consumption. The investigators will also analyze the effects of individual-, household, and community-level measures of migration on experience on married women's levels of autonomy in decision making, an important dimension of modern, urban culture.<br/><br/>Data will be analyzed from the 1994 Guatemalan Census and the 1995 Guatemalan Survey of Family Health. The 1994 census collected information for all household members on the number of years in current place of residence, place of prior residence, place of residence in 1990 and place of birth. The Guatemalan Survey of Family Health interviewed 2,872 randomly selected women age 18 to 35 in 60 rural communities. Nested-conditional logit and discrete-time logit models will be used to analyze recent and lifetime migration.<br/><br/>The study is unique in that it uses individual level census data to analyze internal migration in a developing country and in its incorporation of ethnicity as an explanatory factor in location decisions. The project will fill a gap in the demographic literature on migration in Guatemala. Also, it will advance our understanding of the role of migration in social and economic change in low-income countries."

Although ethnic identity is both psychologically and socially highly significant, it is rarely the case that ethnicity is the only significant group membership that an individual has. As members of a large and complex society, Americans are differentiated or subdivided along many meaningful social dimensions, including gender and sexual orientation, life stage (e.g., student, worker, retiree), economic sector (e.g., technology, service, academics, professional), religion, political ideology, and recreational preferences. Each of these divisions provides a basis for shared identity and group membership that may become an important source of social identification. Further, most of these differentiations are cross-cutting in the sense that individuals may share a common ingroup membership on one dimension but belong to different categories on another dimension. Hence, having multiple group memberships reduces the likelihood that one's social world can be reduced to a single ingroup-outgroup distinction. The purpose of this proposed program of research is to determine how an individual's awareness of his or her own multiple group memberships and social identities contributes to tolerance and acceptance of diversity in the society as a whole. Drawing on a theory of social identity complexity (Roccas & Brewer, 2002), a program of five sets of studies employing both correlational and experimental methods will assess the antecedents of social identity complexity and test the hypothesis that increasing social identity complexity will enhance identification with inclusive, superordinate social categories and consequent acceptance of difference and diversity within the superordinate group."

Two populations that separate accumulate differences at a rate proportional to time divided by population size, and the inability to know population size has required researchers to assume equal population sizes for all populations studied. This is not an acceptable assumption. The new availability of large numbers of highly diverse markers will allow the estimation of relative population effective sizes separately from genetic distances among populations, then use the effective size estimates to scale distances. <br/><br/>The investigators will type 60 short tandem repeat markers and several hundred Alu marker loci in approximately 400 samples from Daghestan. Short tandem repeats are free from the ascertainment bias that has obscured global patterns of human diversity ascertained from classical markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Alu insertions enjoy the property that the ancestral state at the locus, absence of the marker, is always known.

This research will investigate the foundations of community governance and development in India's urban slums. The project has two principal objectives. First, by drawing on variation in levels of inter-ethnic cooperation across India's slums, it seeks to illuminate the conditions that impede or facilitate political organization in socially heterogeneous groups. Second, it will examine how the nature of political organization within slums and the extent of political competition at the municipal and state level interact to produce variation in the distribution of water and electricity across slums. This project rests on a comparative research design that combines 12 months of qualitative fieldwork with a statistical analysis of survey data. In six slum settlements in the Indian cities of Jaipur and Ahmedabad, the co-investigator will trace the development of relations among migrant groups, community leaders, and local political parties. An original survey will be conducted across 1,200 households in the cities of Jaipur and Ahmedabad. This data will allow the co-investigator to statistically test the impact of community institutions and political competition on variation in the supply of public services across slum settlements.<br/><br/>The research will advance three interdisciplinary bodies of scholarship. First, it contributes to the study of social identity and collective action. A growing literature in comparative politics argues that ethnic diversity can significantly undermine collective action and economic development. The emergence of sustained, inter-ethnic organization and development in slum communities in India presents an important theoretical puzzle for this larger literature. This dissertation will add to our knowledge of identity politics and collective action by identifying how diverse people in economically uncertain conditions develop trust and common strategies to improve their lives. Second, it contributes to research on community institutions. Through an analytical comparison of recent community histories, this dissertation will examine the origins of community institutions and the mechanisms of institutional change among diverse migrant groups. Third, development research overwhelmingly focuses on rural poverty. This dissertation joins a budding research agenda in political economy that examines community development and public goods provision in the urban areas of the developing world.<br/><br/>Community development policies largely rest on the notion of ""participatory development""--the notion that poor communities must engage in sustained collective action and synergistic relations with NGOs and local government bodies to improve their welfare and security. Through a rigorous analysis of the microfoundations of collective action and community governance in India's slum settlements, this research will have significant policy relevance for urban development efforts. More than one billion people in the world live in slum and squatter settlements. Beyond India, then, this research will extend to poor urban communities in developing democracies as diverse as Mexico, Bangladesh, Thailand, Argentina, and Ghana. In addition to publications and conferences in the United States, research findings will be presented at research institutions in India, including the Institute of Development Studies (Jaipur), Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), and the Institute of Economic Growth in Delhi. All qualitative interview data and quantitative survey data will be made publically available for transparency and accessibility. Data will be permanently archived at JNU for scholars in India and will be offered to the Social Capital Document Library, a joint project by the World Bank and Michigan State University."

In fact, exclusion constitutes a basic feature of group dynamics that derives from the processes underlying the development and maintenance of social groups. To preserve one's group identity, however, individuals will often exclude others who do not fit the group expectations. While developing a group identity is adaptive, exclusion based on expectations about group norms can lead to prejudicial and discriminatory outcomes. How does this process emerge in childhood? While prior research on moral reasoning has demonstrated that children evaluate exclusion from groups as wrong and unfair, other findings indicate that children display ingroup favoritism and outgroup bias in intergroup dyadic contexts. These discrepant perspectives on group inclusion and exclusion will be investigated by drawing on two complementary theoretical models in developmental social cognition. First, social cognitive domain research has generated findings regarding children's social and moral norms, and has documented the norms children use to include and exclude others and evaluate the 'act' of exclusion. Second, developmental subjective group dynamics research has documented relationships between group identity, group loyalty, and deviant norms used in group interactions, measuring judgments regarding children's evaluations of the 'target' of exclusion. The current research project will investigate how acts and targets of exclusion are evaluated in the context of intragroup and intergroup peer dynamics. Do children prefer an outgroup member (likeability of the target) who espouses a moral norm (evaluation of the act) over an ingroup member who rejects a moral norm? How do judgments about act/target relationships vary as a function of the type of norm, the age of the child, the target of exclusion, and other variables? These questions will be addressed by conducting three empirical studies in which children and adolescents at 9 and 13 years of age will be interviewed and surveyed. Three targets will serve as the focus for each study: gender, race/ethnicity, and school affiliation. A set of measures to be implemented includes children's evaluations of the act of exclusion and inclusion, favorability of the deviant target, evaluation of ingroup/outgroup relationships, and use of social and moral reasoning. These measures will be analyzed with respect to the group identity, age, gender, and ethnicity of the participants as well as to the type of social norms and group loyalty norms presented to participants for their evaluations.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this research lies with understanding the origins of inclusion and exclusion, which reflect the foundations of moral reasoning as well as prejudice and stereotypes. When exclusion based on prejudice and stereotypes manifests in the workforce, productivity as well as positive social relationships are at risk for tension and disruption. By adulthood, biases and stereotypes are deeply entrenched and difficult to change. Thus, successful intervention must be implemented in childhood and adolescence when attitudes about ingroups and outgroups in the form of inclusion and exclusion are emerging. The basic research to be derived from this project will be disseminated to educational and media outlets as well as to educators, psychologists, social scientists, and professionals working with children and adolescents. One anticipated outcome of this project is to help address societal concerns regarding prejudice through facilitating inclusive perspectives based on fairness in the context of group dynamics and peer interactions in childhood and adolescence."

After an initial period of rapid industrial collapse and only limited persistence of apparel firms, there has been a more recent 'rebirth' of production throughout the region, linked primarily to changes in the international structure of the industry and in European Union legislation and markets. The project investigates four aspects of these changes. First, using international trade, production, and employment data, the project documents the emergence of these complex new geographies of apparel production and trade, and assess the specific roles played by changes in the international structure of the industry and by changes in international trade regulations. Second, through interviews with brand-name manufacturers, retailers, marketers, and national buying firms in Western Europe, the U.S., and CEE, the study analyzes the important role of buyer-driven commodity chains in sourcing and controlling suppliers in CEE under conditions of intensely competitive pricing and rapidly changing demand. Third, through detailed case studies in six regions in Slovakia and Bulgaria, the project examines the ways in which international sourcing restructures existing national industries, impacts upon the creation of new firms, and produces a variety of industrial forms and practices. Fourth, in seeking to explain this diversity of apparel production, the project examines the ways in which existing social, institutional, and community conditions in different regions of each country are shaping the enterprises and regional economies that are emerging. <br/><br/>The pace of new firm creation in these regions is astonishing and the regional impacts of these firms and the scope of their integration with European markets surprising. Through this research we hope to contribute to our understanding of the specific forms and practices of what has been more generally characterized as low-wage, assembly production for export. In particular, we hope to contribute to the literatures in economic geography, globalization debates, and post-socialist restructuring about the roles of national suppliers and markets in the operation of the new firms, the extent to which uniform or differentiated production and marketing strategies are emerging, and the impacts local conditions have on the operation of primarily international contract and assembly production. The proposed research will enable us to examine more fully the conditions and contradictions associated with international integration and local economic reconfiguration in post-socialist Europe. The project will enable us to move beyond single-region and single-country case studies by providing a cross-national and cross-regional analysis of local economic transformations in apparel producing areas. Finally, the research will contribute to our understanding of the role of other economic and social practices in shaping the internationalization of the post-socialist apparel industry and its producing regions."

The current project will extend an ongoing, longitudinal project that has been examining interrelations among parental conflict, sleep, and child adjustment. Previous waves of data collection in this project demonstrated that disruptions in an important facet of children's biological regulation, namely sleep, can have deleterious effects on typically developing children, and highlighted the importance of simultaneously examining family and sleep functioning in the prediction of child outcomes. The opportunity to follow the same families during a time when children are entering puberty is vital to determine the role of marital conflict in child development. Children and their families will be asked to participate in a third wave of data collection in which marital functioning and associated processes (e.g., emotional insecurity) are examined, children's sleep quality and quantity are assessed, and multiple domains of children's adjustment (socio-emotional, cognitive, academic) are investigated. This wave of data collection will allow the investigators to (1) analyze the mediating (intervening) role of sleep in the link between marital conflict and child development over time; (2) determine whether relations among marital conflict, children's sleep, and daytime functioning persist, weaken, or become stronger as children enter puberty, and ascertain if these associations differ based on child sex, ethnicity or socio-economic status; and (3) clarify processes that can influence child adaptation in the context of marital conflict and sleep disruptions. <br/><br/>Knowledge of contextual factors (e.g., high marital conflict) and psychobiological processes (e.g., sleep) associated with normative familial risk in children are critical for education and prevention efforts, multidisciplinary intervention, and institutional structures and policies relating to children and families. Understanding the role of sleep will inform interventions that promote resiliency, coping, and competence in many areas of functioning. By integrating theories and methods from different disciplines, the study will facilitate collaborations among the medical and social sciences in the ultimate service of public policy and practice. Further, Alabama's high rate of poverty, as well as large minority (African-American) population, makes the setting advantageous for studying the impact of multiple factors on the well-being of a diverse population of children. There are also a number of educational benefits of this study. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary methods and working with a diverse population. Parents, school administrators, teachers, clinicians, and county agents will have the opportunity to participate in training workshops and seminars that are based on study findings. Finally, results will be presented via professional meetings, multidisciplinary journals, and a user-friendly website."

Chapurukha Kusimba, Ryan Raaum, and Sloan Williams will conduct two field seasons of archaeological, ethnohistoric, and archaeogenetics research on the Kenyan coast. The archaeological excavations will be centered at the site of Mtwapa, a prominent Swahili port town dating from ca. 1732 BCE to 1750 AD. Ethnographic research will be carried out amongst Swahili ethnohistorians, elders and other indigenous interlocutors about their origins to identify possible source populations. Archaeogenetic data from human remains excavated from Mtwapa will be compared with African, Middle Eastern and Asian genetic databases. Finally, physical and chemical analysis of ceramic, iron, and trade artifacts, and faunal and botanical remains will be conducted to reconstruct subsistence and technology and to identify relationships both with other regions of East Africa and throughout the Indian Ocean. These new technologies when combined with careful excavations and detailed ethnographic information will allow Drs. Kusimba, Raaum, and Williams to address the following hypotheses: 1) that early Swahili populations, while primarily of African origin, were much more diverse composition than commonly supposed; 2) that some non-African migration to the coast did occur prior to the 19th century 3) that Swahili stone towns were ethnically diverse. <br/><br/>Dr. Kusimba's long-term research agenda has focused on understanding the origin and biological composition of the towns and city-states that developed on the East African coast in the late first millennium CE. Archaeological investigations in Kenya and Tanzania have demonstrated that the artifactual traditions in the early city-states show a clear evolutionary development from earlier villages. Thus preindustrial urbanism in East Africa and elsewhere owes its rise, sustenance, and demise to wider regional and interregional interaction spheres. In the case of East Africa, this development was furthered by relationships with the African hinterland and connections to the wider Indian Ocean trading system. <br/><br/>This collaborative research is addressing key questions, which have important implications for understanding human population relationships both within and beyond Africa. The researchers hope this project will demonstrate the long suspected but still as yet proven shared biological genealogy of East African peoples and their Indian Ocean neighbors. In East Africa, this study may have positive implications for national unity, often fractured by ethnicity and 'tribalism'. The rich historic, anthropological, linguistic evidence coupled with ancient and contemporary genetic data to be collected in this project will contribute new knowledge and open new avenues in interdisciplinary research between archaeologists and geneticists. Additionally the project will train two graduate students, one American Colin LeJeune, and the other Kenyan, Ibrahim Busolo, for their PhD in Swahili archaeology and genetics. It will also enable the recruitment and training undergraduate students in field and laboratory research from Lehman College and the University of Illinois-Chicago."

Many school systems have brought full-time police officers (usually called School Resource Officers) onto campuses; others have combined this new security presence with zero-tolerance punishment policies. Yet neither researchers nor educators have investigated the process by which schools enforce their safety policies. We do not know whether students perceive this new brand of school discipline and security as legitimate and fair, if they feel protected or alienated by increasingly aggressive security regimes, or if these reactions influence how students bond to their schools. Furthermore, we do not know how the process of maintaining discipline and security varies across different groups of students. Improving the efficiency, fairness, and effectiveness of crime prevention in schools requires that we address these issues.<br/><br/>The proposed research project, School Discipline and Security: Maintaining Safety and Legitimacy, investigates how school discipline and security are exercised in contemporary high schools, and how students and staff experience this security regime. In particular, the project asks the following questions: 1) To what extent do students and staff perceive school discipline and security to be fair?, 2) Do student perceptions of school discipline vary by race/ethnicity and socio-economic status?, and 3) Does the process of maintaining school safety alienate students from participating in school activities?<br/><br/>The project entails a three-part data collection strategy in order to compare school discipline and security in schools where a majority of students are white and middle-class, to schools where a majority of students are non-white and lower-class. Comparisons will be made both across demographically diverse schools, and across groups of students within each school. Part one includes observations of student-staff interactions (including student-police officer, student-administrator, and student-teacher). Part two includes interviews with a sample of 100 students, parents, teachers, school administrators, and school security staff. Part three includes a survey of approximately 2,000 high school students. All research will be completed in two schools within Maricopa County, Arizona, and two schools within New Castle County, Delaware. Data will be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. <br/><br/>This project addresses theoretically important yet unresolved issues and debates about how youth are policed and punished. It offers an opportunity to test theories about procedural justice, which argue that how rules are enforced may be more important in shaping perceptions of fairness than what the rules are. Additionally, though prior studies demonstrate that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be disciplined in school than white students, it is unclear how recently emerging school security practices are enforced across demographically diverse schools, or whether they are experienced differently across students within schools. <br/><br/>Further, this project promises to have a broad and beneficial practical impact. As prior research shows, students are more likely to follow school rules if they believe these rules are legitimate and fairly enforced; by studying how students perceive school rules, this project can contribute directly to schools efforts to maintain fair, and consequentially safe, learning environments. Additionally, since the project will compare school discipline and security across majority white, middle-class areas and majority non-white, lower-class areas, the results can be used to improve how disadvantaged students are treated within schools (and thus possibly reducing dropout rates among minority youth). Furthermore, the research will provide new opportunities to train and mentor graduate students."

The virtual peers, called pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs), may encourage and persuade girls to increase their belief of self-efficacy in learning math and to build more positive attitudes toward pursuing careers in STEM.<br/><br/>Research indicates that girls' negative views of the fields of STEM are often due to social and cultural influences. Family, schools, and media are likely to impose stereotypic role expectations on girls and infuse girls with ideal ""Barbie doll"" images of girls. As a result, many girls tend to identify STEM as masculine and doubt their ability to compete. Girls need to be exposed to social environments that will encourage them to overcome ungrounded social stereotypes and build constructive views of their competency in STEM. Although the stereotypic views of family, teachers, or friends cannot be immediately changed or influenced, girl-friendly virtual social environments can be created to help girls build positive attitudes toward STEM. <br/><br/>The project will 1) investigate the effectiveness of PALs in facilitating girls' self-confidence and efficacy in learning math and 2) investigate the characteristics of PALs critical to that end. To reach the goals, a three-year research agenda is planned. In the first year, the project will focus on the effects of the gender and age of PALs. The research will investigate whether gender (male vs. female) and age (adult vs. peer) are related to girls' choices of PALs as their learning partners and, subsequently, girls' self-efficacy and attitude change. In the second year, the project will focus on the effects of the competency and ethnicity of PALs. The research will be an investigation of whether PALs' competency (strong vs. weak) and ethnicity (Caucasian vs. Hispanic) have an impact on Caucasian and Hispanic girls' choices of PALs as their learning partners and, subsequently, girls' self-efficacy and attitude change. In the third year, the project will concentrate on the effects of the feedback type and emotion of PALs. The research will be an investigation of whether PALs' feedback type (harsh vs. nice) and emotion (empathetic vs. non-empathetic) will have an impact on girls' attribution of their success and failure, their self-efficacy, and their feelings of affability with PALs. The research questions will be answered using a quasi-experimental design and both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample will include approximately 200 9th-grade girls in required algebra I classes in public high schools in large and mid-size cities in a mountain-west state of the USA.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>First, unlike most technology-based interventions that have been focused on the cognitive aspect of learning, this project is geared toward the affective aspect of girls' math learning. This project will identify how PALs can be used to effect girls' math self-efficacy and positive attitude toward learning math. Second, PALs are a special subset of pedagogical agents and are grounded on findings from human-peer interaction research. This project will identify the specific characteristics of PALs that might affect girls' math self-efficacy and attitudes. Third, PAL-based interventions will be implemented in ordinary classrooms regularly throughout the semester. This project will provide classroom-based evidence on the educational value of PALs in K-12 settings and implications for long-term use.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The project is conducted through the collaborative efforts of a multidisciplinary team and so will yield implications for multiple communities, such as researchers in women/gender education, STEM education in general, educational technology, human/computer interaction, and artificial intelligence in education.<br/><br/>If found to be effective, PALs are potentially an efficient and cost-effective intervention to re-shape girls' STEM beliefs and attitudes, compared to human-mentoring programs. Through classroom implementation, the project has implications for PALs' role for improving Caucasian and minority girls' math self-efficacy and attitudes. The influential characteristics of PALs for PAL/learner relations identified in the project will provide implications for research on human relations as well as on human/computer interactions."

This will be a longitudinal study that will characterize the role of school and person factors in the development of STEM-related interests and choices of girls and minority youth. <br/><br/>The study has three aims which will determine: 1) how these crucial factors associated with STEM interests and goals develop, change, or remain stable over time for girls (ages 10-17) compared to boys, and for students of varying race/ethnicity and socioeconomic levels, 2) if the hypothesized model predicting STEM interests is supported, and 3) how gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic level moderate associations among model variables. A diverse sample of 900 students, grades 5, 7 and 9, will be followed for three years. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies will be used to test the central hypothesis. Survey instruments, focus groups and interviews will be used each year of the project. The fundamental new knowledge obtained about the development of STEM interests is expected to advance the fields of developmental, vocational, and multicultural psychology, teacher education, education science, and gender and racial equity in STEM.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts - The project integrates teaching, learning and research by directly involving students in the proposed project. Educational infrastructure will be enhanced by providing research opportunities and training to students in education research. Over time, a broader network of educators, counselors, and education scientists who are prepared to address gender and minority equity issues in STEM may develop. Results and interventions that result from the project will be disseminated widely, through academic, public school and general public venues, as well as through a web site designed for young people and those who work with them."

CST is generally defined as a defendant's ability to consult with his or her attorney and understand the court proceedings, including current charges. In Arizona, before being found delinquent, juveniles who commit crimes must be found competent to stand trial. If the juvenile court is based on the goal of rehabilitation and the perception of youth as less responsible, why is it necessary to adopt standards that ensure a defendant is competent to stand trial? In fact, one might argue that the very construct of competency to stand trial does not make sense in a court where youth are adjudicated rather than convicted and are not even granted all the constitutional rights given to adults. By ensuring youth are competent to stand trial, the court may be realigning the juvenile court to be more similar to the criminal court, which may introduce greater punitiveness to juvenile court dispositions. <br/><br/>This study examines how court actors (judicial officers, defense attorneys, and prosecutors) understand and construct youths' competency to stand trial in Maricopa County (Phoenix) juvenile courts, and the impact this early decision has on case processing. Specifically, my research questions are: 1) What are the predictors of the competency decision? 2) How do court officials make the decision to request a competency evaluation for youth? What are the characteristics of the youth and the offense that court officials utilize to make the request? 3) How are court actors socialized within the court community to distinguish between competent and incompetent youth? What are the common characteristics of youth court actors utilize to request competency evaluations and in the judicial officers' case, the characteristics utilized to make a final competency decision? 4) What are the consequences of the competency decision? Do youth differ in their dispositions based on the competency distinction? The first and fourth research questions are answered through the quantitative analysis of juvenile offense and offender data (e.g. offense, prior record, ethnicity, sex, family structure, socioeconomic status, gang membership, and school achievement, age, IQ, mental illness diagnosis, competency outcome, and disposition) available through the statewide Juvenile Online Tracking System. The second and third research questions are answered through observing competency hearings and interviewing court officials. <br/><br/>This project contributes to the socio-legal knowledge of courtroom decision-making in three ways. First, since this literature is predominantly focused on the sentencing decision, as opposed to entry-point decisions, this project will enhance our understanding of how the pool of court cases is established and therefore, how biases and inequities may enter the juvenile justice process. Second, much of the juvenile court decision-making literature relies only on quantitative research, which is poorly suited for understanding the interaction of contextual and individual-level variables in the decision-making process. In contrast, this project uses mixed methods: statistical models to predict competency decision-making and case dispositions (research questions 1 and 4), and observations of competency hearings and interviews with court officials to reach a deeper understanding of how court actors construct competency as well as how they use this information in deciding on juveniles' cases (research questions 2 and 3). Third, it will be the first empirical study to examine how court actors evaluate competency and use this evaluation in their deliberations about youths' cases. <br/><br/>In addition to contributing to our understanding of courtroom decision-making, this study promises to have a broader, practical impact. Since the competency legislation is relatively new (enacted in 2001) in Arizona, the results of this study will be utilized to directly impact policy decisions at the juvenile court level. This project will assist juvenile courts in understanding both the indirect (e.g. potential disparities between those found competent and those found incompetent) and direct (e.g. county, state, and federal expenditures, youth dispositions) effects of the competency decision for youth and administration. In particular, the study will help juvenile courts reduce racial/ethnic, class and gender inequities in case processing."

While the largest proportion of jobs are low status services, many scholars and policy makers argue this technology is the solution for global unemployment, especially for women. Many development projects sponsored by organizations like the United Nations and World Bank center around ICTs. Critics argue that these ICTs are responsible for the rise of new global sweatshops, which are dominated heavily by women in the South. This project seeks to assess the potential of such development projects, and whether these new technologies are empowering or disadvantageous for women in the global South. The research is based on case studies of call centers, which provide ""customer service agents"" for corporations in the North. By the year 2008, these call centers are projected to hire 18 million workers, most of them female. This relatively new workforce, emerging largely in the last five years, is almost completely unexplored academically. This project intends to fill this gap, focusing on India where the growth of the global IT workforce has been especially dramatic. Through on-site fieldwork in New Delhi, the investigator will study three call centers, including interviews with 300 workers, as well as industry, governmental, and non-governmental association leaders. The evidence will be used to adjudicate between competing perspectives on this phenomenon: a modernization paradigm that sees technology as gender neutral, or else beneficial for women; a critical or feminist paradigm that sees technology as disadvantageous for women; and an organizational paradigm that sees size and structure as mediating factors which vary outcomes in different corporate settings. In addition, this study assesses competing theories of global culture in ICTs, by asking whether the requirement for Indian workers to pose as Americans in calls to the U.S. results in assimilation or disjuncture in their sense of national and ethnic identity. Thus, this study advances scholarly literatures in many areas, including technology, gender, development, stratification, work, race and ethnicity, globalization, and business management. <br/>This project contributes to enhancing equity in use of information technology, especially for women in Southern countries like India. It informs organizational policy and practice involving technology. The broader impact includes training opportunities for students, expanding opportunities for women faculty in science, and improving the infrastructure of scholarly networks between the U.S. and India (through collaboration with a university in New Delhi). This project will also contribute to U.S. policy research on the gender digital divide within the information technology workforce, for government bodies like the National Coordination Office for Information Technology Research and Development, as well to international policy for ICT development programs of the United Nations and World Bank."

Colonial-era accounts often described the social order of Zanzibar as a racially-layered pyramid. At the top was a privileged rural aristocracy of Arab plantation owners, in the middle was a large Indian merchant class, and at the base lay a mass of African laborers. After the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution, however, the state consolidated its control over most economic and social activities and this social order was changed. As a result, the entire Indian community on the island of Pemba emigrated and many of the Arab families migrated to Oman. Zanzibar's recent implementation of market liberalization has resulted in the emergence of a new urban-based commercial class, whose members are mostly Arabs with connections to the Middle East. Mr. McKim will study the social, economic, and political transformations of this commercial class to determine how the Arabs overcame their officially disadvantaged social identity and became successful in commerce, and how they refashioned their identity as an urban elite status group. Information will be collected from ethnographic and archival research in Zanzibar, and interviews with the families of Pemban businessmen who reside in Oman. Research techniques will include participant observation, surveys, interviews, audiotaped oral histories, network sampling, and archival research. Members of the Department of Archives, Museum and Antiquities, Zanzibar Revolutionary Government, will collaborate with Mr. McKim on this project. <br/><br/>The results of this study will increase the knowledge about ethnicity and identity, and how an ethnic group operates in a larger multi-dimensional domain.

The proposed work has the potential to increase understanding of the results of research on sex similarities and differences and on how to use these results in STEM educational policy and program design and decision-making. The project team long time gender and STEM researchers, with backgrounds in research synthesis. The project will produce and disseminate a series of research based materials to increase STEM advocate and researcher knowledge and their ability to communicate that knowledge to non-research populations. Materials will draw on theory, research and practice from the sciences, social sciences, and education.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: There is currently great media interest in this topic, but inaccuracies and stereotypes abound. By providing researchers, advocates, the media and the general internet public with usable, accessible, accurate information and tools to get this information out, this project has the potential to help policymakers, educators and even parents and students make more research based decisions. The project compliments a number of other parallel efforts to synthesize information and will likely boost attention to research."

MIDFIELD is a resource enabling the study of students that includes longitudinal, whole population data for multiple institutions. Retention, measured in various ways, has been the dominant mode of studying student success in engineering education and in higher education in general. However, simply studying who matriculates and who graduates does not tell the complete story of a student's path through the engineering curriculum nor should it be used as a measure of an institution. A national, longitudinal student unit-record database would enable study of engineering programs and benchmark metrics consistently. MIDFIELD has already been proven to facilitate data on student matriculation habits disaggregated across various engineering disciplines, ethnicities and genders. However is value as a predictive tool has also been somewhat limited due to the small (eleven) number of institutions who have provided their student data.<br/><br/>This project will enable the expansion of the MIDFIELD database to include a total of 103 institutions. With input from university data managers, engineering education administrators, specialists in high volume data archiving and the community of researchers, this work will result in a database containing over 1.05 million students. More specifically the data will represent over 50% of the U.S. engineering undergraduate degrees awarded and increase the diversity of institutions in the dataset. MIDFIELD will now include public and private institutions, minority serving institutions, and institutions from a broad range of research classifications. The sheer scope and longitude of MIDFIELD will enable significant improvements in research in higher education. It will enable the development of research capacity to examine student characteristics (race/ethnicity/gender/social class) and curricular pathways (including coursework) by institution and over time. Furthermore, this project will utilize workshops as well as asynchronous training modules to educate the broader research community, expanding the network of researchers capable of conducting this research and the sharing of innovative research methods in addition to the actual data. Finally, because the dataset contains students records of all students matriculating over a period of time, researchers can study students across all disciplines, not solely engineering.<br/><br/>Due to the broad nature of the disciplines represented by MIDFIELD, this project has cross-Directorate support from the Directorates of Engineering, Math and Physical Sciences (MPS), and Education and Human Resources (EHR) as well as the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA). Within the MPS Directorate, this work is supported by Astronomy, and Physics; within EHR, this work is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development."

This study examines how the male-gendered construction of STEM creates environments that put women at risk for social identity threat, which harms their performance, motivation, and identification with STEM fields. For men, the masculinization of STEM leads to social identity privilege, which can improve their outcomes. <br/><br/>This research tests three hypotheses. The amplification hypothesis proposes that the impact of social identity threat will be greater in more masculinized STEM fields relative to less masculinized STEM fields. This is tested through a manipulation of social identity threat by exposing participants to an allegedly sexist instructor (Study 1), a sexist joke (Study 2), or body objectifying photos (Study 3). The cultural grounding hypothesis proposes that the masculinization of STEM and the resultant gender gap varies across cultural contexts. This hypothesis is tested by examining the magnitude of the amplification effects across universities (Studies 1 - 3). The consciousness-raising hypothesis proposes that increased consciousness of sexism as a source of the STEM gender gap protects women's outcomes in STEM fields. Studies 1 - 3 test this hypothesis by examining whether individual differences in critical consciousness are a source of resilience for women exposed to social identity threatening cues in a STEM domain. Study 4 tests this hypothesis by examining whether a consciousness-raising intervention has long term impacts on academic outcomes among women majoring in STEM. STEM majors at the University of Kansas, Tulane University, and Xavier University are participating in this research.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This research promotes teaching, training, and learning at the PIs' institutions through the creation of research teams of undergraduate and graduate research assistants. Students will have the opportunity to assist in data collection, data analysis, and will be given opportunities to serve as co-authors on conference presentations and publications when appropriate. The project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in science by including Xavier students as both research participants and as members of the research team. Providing opportunities for Xavier students to work as research assistants contributes to the development of ethnic minority scientists. The results of this research will be communicated to STEM majors at the participating institutions, STEM educators, and the scientific community. The research has the potential to benefit society more broadly by identifying factors that make women vulnerable and resilient in STEM contexts. The approach will integrate research and education by using the results of the research to develop an educational intervention to increase women?s performance and participation in STEM fields. The research findings and integrative approach ultimately contribute to more effective scientific institutions."

In recent years, sociolegal scholars have begun to investigate how cultural variation in preferences for dispute resolution procedures is related to individual psychological processes. This study will extend this work by examining how procedural preferences are shaped by a person's culture of origin, acculturation to new social forms, gender, social status, and economic resources. This comparative study conducted in the United States, Germany, and Hong Kong systematically analyzes patterns of procedural preferences, attitudes toward various forms of regulation, and dispute-related beliefs and behaviors. These three sites have been the target of substantial migration. Two experimental studies will be conducted, involving approximately 500 participants at each site, to test whether differences in preferences for types of dispute resolution reflect differences in values or differences in beliefs about the effective or appropriate means to reach their goals. One study will focus on preferences about options available for dealing with disputes (such as ignoring the conflict, ignoring the disputant, or direct negotiation). The second will consider the means available to resolve the conflict (such as mediation or adversarial adjudication). The project will contribute to our understanding of transnational issues by advancing our knowledge of how culture, ethnicity, recency of migration, and other social factors interact to shape individuals' legal attitudes and reactions to a variety of laws, disputing fora, and disputing options. From a global perspective, the results will have major significance for increasing our knowledge of what drives preferences for one form of law or regulatory regime over another and of why people of diverse cultural origins differ in their views about what constitutes a fair procedure or law."

Supporting Partners include the Greater Homewood Community Corporation, Park Heights Renaissance, Southeast Community Development Corporation, Greektown Community Development Corporation, Education Based Latino Outreach, Child First Authority, Baltimore National Aquarium, and the Maryland Science Center. SABES is a unique approach to STEM education that builds expertise and excitement for STEM learning within target communities by engaging BCPS teachers and students in grades 3-5, caregivers, community-based organizations, afterschool program providers, faculty and students from JHU, members of Baltimore's high-tech businesses, and local museums. SABES not only directly engages approximately forty STEM teachers and more than 1,620 grade 3-5 students at nine elementary schools in three high-minority, low-income, Baltimore neighborhoods, but it extends far into the wider community, drawing on the expertise of higher education faculty at JHU, museums and STEM business leaders. In the process, SABES prepares afterschool STEM project facilitators in each neighborhood, creating a community-wide culture of STEM learning relevant to the lives of its participants in ways that engage caregivers to sustain student curiosity outside of the classroom. <br/><br/>A fundamental premise that undergirds SABES' work is that the integration of science into the learner's world, as opposed to bringing students into the world of scientists, has great potential to enable deep learning, self-efficacy and student agency. Grounded in this perspective, SABES establishes Mutually Beneficial Partnerships (MBPs) in three low-income, majority-minority communities and employs three main strategies to obtain its goals of broad participation in science, increased student achievement in STEM, and increased teacher proficiency. These strategies are: (1) sustained/collaborative professional development including professional learning communities, (2) scaffolds that bridge school learning with applications of STEM in the community including biannual community STEM Recognition Events featuring students' STEM projects, and (3) STEM visiting experts from JHU and high-tech industries as well as field trips linked to careers in action.<br/><br/>The SABES research agenda pursues the following questions: 1. If the impact evaluation shows that some intended outcomes are affected in desired directions by SABES, but others not, what theory-building or holistic understandings of educational improvement efforts and mechanisms can emerge from these findings? 2. What aspects of the proposed intervention are most effective for creating a sustainable STEM community where previously there exists little expertise or organized activity outside the school? 3. How does effectiveness vary between neighborhoods or schools that differ in student composition (e.g., race/ethnicity, and English language proficiency), neighborhood resources and infrastructure, and other aspects of school organization (e.g., other high-priority initiatives in a school that might compete with SABES for staff attention, stability of principal or teacher incumbency)? The research design employs the application of a multi-level, ecological perspective which will result in important findings related to developing science literacy in a community, engagement of formal and informal settings and structures as assets for developing teaching and learning in science, and examining the impacts on achievement, particularly related to closing the achievement gap among students of different ethnicities, language proficiencies and income levels."

Also examined will be influences of parent-child attachment and child temperament on children's social competence with peers. Finally, the data will provide opportunities to evaluate effects of life events stress and daily hassles on attributes of the social network and on social competence.

A sample of families will be recruited in each project year that covers the spectrum of ethnicity an d income levels targeted in the study, in approximate proportion to the population of the State of Alabama. Approximately 25% of the sample in each project year will come from African-American background and approximately 50% of the sample in each project year will have family incomes below the median income level in Alabama. Information gathered in the course of the project will test a formal model that hypothesizes direct and indirect influences of family relationships and child temperament on peer social competence and on attributes of children's social networks. Peer competence is assessed in the context of child care classrooms. Home visits are used to observe parent-child interactions relevant to the quality of their relationships. Social networks and life events stresses are evaluated from interviews with both the parent and child. The data collection plan and analytic strategies afford opportunities to assess the influences of the classroom, the neighborhood, and various socioeconomic indicators on both the social support networks and peer social competence. Results from this study may be used to inform policy concerning optimal timing of group care experiences for preschool children, and will also be relevant to evaluating the relative influences of families, classroom social and physical environments, and informal social support networks on children's sense of well-being. ***"

The study's long-term span, innovative genealogical design, and comprehensive content have been critical to the fundamental understanding of a wide variety of key social science issues, including those involving life course effects. With thirty-plus years of data on the same families, the PSID can justly be considered a cornerstone of the infrastructure support for empirically based social science research. Through its long-term measures of economic and social well being, and based on its representative sample of U.S. families, the study has compelled both researchers and policy makers to confront and learn from the dynamism inherent in economic processes.<br/><br/>The enormous usefulness of decades of data on the same families has made the PSID one of the most widely used social science data sets in the world. The project currently delivers 6,500 customized data sets a year to researchers via its Internet Data Center. Since 1968, over 2,000 journal articles, books and chapters, dissertations and other works have been based on PSID data. And the study has been named one of the National Science Foundation's `Nifty Fifty' most notable research efforts.<br/><br/>The 1997-2001 funding cycle represented a major transition period for the PSID, in which the project implemented several important changes. In response to concern about dramatic growth in sample size, maintenance of representativeness, and fiscal constraints at the federal level, the project added a refresher sample of post-1968 immigrants and suspended a number of families from the original Census Bureau oversample of low-income families. Most importantly, the study moved to a bi-ennial data collection schedule, with consequent changes to the instrument in order to collect interwave information on key variables. All of these changes returned the study to a ""steady state"" that maintains a sample of about the same size, attains national representation inclusive of new entrants, and has proved less costly to run-while maintaining the study's traditionally high data quality. In addition, to facilitate greater use of the data set, content was expanded in six major areas (intergenerational studies; savings and consumption; technology and capital formation; health and aging; child development; and immigration).<br/><br/>In the 2002-2006 funding cycle, the PSID stabilizes and maintains this new state of the study. In contrast to the pre-1997 state, the study's interview periodicity is now longer and its content is greatly expanded. The project focuses on improving the measures in areas affected by the longer periodicity, assessing the research value of the newly added content domains, and improving the processing and delivery of the data that is collected. Specifically, the project:<br/><br/>1. Expands content to facilitate investigation of current research questions and policy issues;<br/>2. Continues the 1997-2001 cycle's data collection design changes, including biennial interviewing, with the associated cost reductions and productivity increases;<br/>3. Integrates event history calendar methodology into the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) application to ensure data quality despite the greater time between interviews;<br/>4. Maintains and improves several new systems for data editing, processing, and documentation;<br/>5. Ensures that the study is the ""Gold Standard"" for income information through redesign of the CATI data collection instrument based on an Income and Wages Project; and<br/>6. Improves and expedite data delivery through enhancements of the PSID web site Data Center.<br/><br/>The renewal permits the PSID to perfect and assess the research value of the wider content areas and further facilitate usage of the study's data through improved data collection and processing. These efforts strongly reinforce the infrastructure value of the study in terms of the range of topics that can be addressed with the data and the ease of use for an ever-broadening range of social science scholars."

Moreover, the within-group variation in performance far exceeds the differences among normatively measured groups. This suggests that race, ethnicity, and poverty, and school-specific factors, explain only a small portion of the differences in subsequent academic performance. Policymakers have for decades designed health, education, and social welfare policies to help level the playing field for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.<br/><br/>This research investigates the determinants and evolution of performance gaps across and within groups during elementary and middle school, focusing on the roles of educational, medical, and social welfare policy interventions experienced during early childhood. Earlier studies of early childhood interventions have several data problems that may impede our understanding of the role of public policy in explaining early and mid-run educational outcomes. This research will overcome the major weaknesses in previous studies on the subject; it merges cohorts of birth vital statistics to elementary school records, and administrative records on early childhood intervention participation drawn from multiple sources. A wide array of early intervention programs, ranging from follow-up programs serving neonatal intensive care graduates to Head Start and Even Start will be considered. The data sets are extremely large and very detailed, and the analysis data set will be constructed using every student in the state of Florida whose birth records can be matched with education data, including special education placement, attendance, behavioral referrals and scores on the state's mandated comprehensive assessment test. The use of large administrative data sets reduces measurement problems, and also facilitates the study of heterogeneous policy effects.<br/><br/>The large and rich data allows a study of a wide variety of interrelated problems, including: (i) whether school-based pre-kindergarten programs improve the performance of children from low-income families and (ii) the effects of social service program participation on children's performance. The statistical techniques are straightforward and appropriate. Some of the variables are endogenous but the data is rich enough for the PI to provide credible identification strategies to determine causal effects. The results of this research will have important educational policy implications, not only in the US but probably throughout the world."

The research will yield better information about how colleges vary in instructional expenditures. It will also give new information about variation within and across colleges in family incomes, standardized test scores, and the racial composition of their student bodies. The<br/>research will also characterize how financial aid varies with standardized test scores, family incomes,<br/>race/ethnicity, and other characteristics of students. The researchers will also evaluate how colleges, students of color, and white students value ethnic/racial diversity in choosing a college or making admissions decisions. The research approach entails theoretical analysis and parallel computational and empirical analysis.<br/><br/>The research methods will be adopted to allow for informational asymmetries between colleges and their prospective students, asymmetries that have potentially important implications for admission and financial aid policies. This creates a challenging statistical problem that will require new techniques. Standard approaches used by other researchers to study other markets are not a good choice for analyzing the market for higher education for two reasons. First, product characteristics are endogenous because colleges choose how much to spend on teaching and also influence the composition of their student bodies. Second, because of financial aid prices for a given student type will differ across colleges but are only observed at the college attended. The research team will develop new statistical techniques to deal with these problems.<br/><br/>The research will develops and estimates a general equilibrium model of higher education and uses the model to study public policy issues. The general equilibrium framework is particularly important for study of policy issues that may change the equilibrium financial aid and admission policies of all institutions of higher education. Among the key contributions of the research is endogenizing college qualities in a general equilibrium framework with asymmetric information. Because the college objective function that is modeled and tested differs from profit maximization, this research adds to the theoretical and empirical literatures on nonprofit institutions. The research also contributes to understanding of peer effects by elucidating the way in which peer effects affect college qualities, admissions decisions, and financial aid policies, and by developing empirical evidence about the extent to which observed admission and financial aid policies are consistent with the model's predictions. A further, related innovation in the research is study of the effects of diversity in a general equilibrium framework. Finally, this project is on the frontier of integrating theory, computation, and estimation. <br/><br/>Key public policy elements of this research are study of the effects of federal financial aid policies and study of the role of publicly funded state universities. The research considers the effect of affirmative action policies on student body composition. The research also investigates the effect of federal financial aid policies on college access, taking account of the way in which federal aid policies and college competition lead to changes in aid provided from colleges' own resources. The research will contribute to understanding how state funding policies and admissions policies of public <br/>universities affect access and costs of college. The research thus has the promise to provide a significant advance in understanding and quantifying the effects of public policy on college access and college costs for different racial and socio-economic groups."

Empirical evidence reveals that labor markets are often highly segregated with respect to ascribed attributes such as race, ethnicity, and gender. Most explanations of this segregation can be classified as either 'supply-side' (worker qualifications or preferences) or 'demand-side' (job requirements or discrimination by employers). Yet neither of these approaches addresses the structure of information that links potential workers and employers, or how actors evaluate the information they do acquire. This is unfortunate, since how potential workers hear about vacant jobs, and how employers view referred employees, are crucial parts of the hiring process that have implications for individuals' opportunities and, potentially, for the level of segregation in labor markets. We formalize information-related aspects of the matching process into two additional mechanisms. The first rests on constraints on access to information: if information about jobs flows only through networks linking potential workers, then the structure and composition of those networks will influence who hears about--and is hired into--vacant jobs, and networks composed of similar people could therefore produce and maintain segregation within jobs or firms, without any discriminatory action on the part of individual employers. Alternatively, if evaluating a candidate's potential is difficult, information from trusted employees may be more valuable than information from strangers. In this situation, employers may prefer to hire workers who are referred by their current employees; again, to the extent that networks are segregated, the labor market will be segregated. Previous scholars have found it difficult to tease apart the relative impact of each explanation in empirical studies; therefore, the core of this project is the development of a labor market simulation that allows us to implement each of these types of 'mechanisms' (supply-side, demand-side, and information-related) as a set of structures and a set of rules. We will calibrate the simulation model with data describing empirical labor markets and then use it as an experimental framework to generate testable hypotheses about the relationship between each mechanism, other labor market characteristics, and the level of segregation in particular types of labor markets. The project should have several broad impacts: it will demonstrate the utility of simulation method as a tool to address substantively important yet empirically difficult problems; insights from the simulation may be used to focus subsequent empirical studies; and, most importantly, we hope that this study will help us identify practical strategies that might effectively reduce racial, ethnic, and gender segregation in labor markets."

Employers experimented with dozens of different compliance measures. Many were largely symbolic, such as anti-discrimination policies, while others offered procedural guarantees of equal treatment, such as in dealing with sexual harassment and formal promotion. Still others were more substantive in that they involved positive steps to increase diversity, such as special management training for women and minority mentoring programs. Which of these measures have worked? How did the law matter, and through what kinds of changes in employment practices did it have influence? This project builds on institutional theories of organizational action to address these questions. It distinguishes between symbolic, procedural, and substantive anti-discrimination activities, and specifies hypotheses about the relative effectiveness of each strategy.<br/><br/>The project tests the hypotheses using employment data from the annual reports that 412 large employers submitted to the government from 1978 through 1993. These publicly available reports detail employment by race, ethnicity, and gender in nine occupational categories. It also surveys these companies to chart the history of their personnel practices, and merges the survey data with the annual reports. It then analyzes how particular employment practices of the companies (obtained from the survey data) affect the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of their workforce (obtained from the annual reports). The project represents the first sustained effort to sort out the effects of employment practices on workforce composition, and to measure the effectiveness of activities designed to satisfy anti-discrimination laws in making the workforce more diverse."

As women have increased their participation in non-farm labor markets and as agricultural industries have changed in recent decades, the role of women in farm production has been transformed, but little scholarly attention has been given to the form and implications of those changes. This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate changes in the agricultural work of women in the fresh apple industries of Washington state. Apple production and processing has become more labor intensive and more capital intensive over the last half century. Special attention in this project will be given to identifying differences in the responses of women in different ethnic groups, socioeconomic classes, and age cohorts to changes in the industry. These differences will be identified through analyses of census data and a mail survey of women working in north central Washington. More detailed information will be obtained through intensive interviews and focus-group discussions of both Chicana and Anglo working women. In order to ascertain whether preliminary conclusions are valid, project findings will be discussed at community-based workshops. This project will provide new insights into the impacts of technological and organizational change on workers employed by agricultural businesses. This case study of female workers in the Washington apple industry will employ a complementary set of research methods to contribute new empirical knowledge about social change, with special emphases placed on the roles of gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class. As a doctoral dissertation research improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research ca reer."

Previous studies of immigrant assimilation have focused on political, economic, and social assimilation, as well as education and ethnic identity. However, no major study has emphasized the process of cultural assimilation for immigrant second generation youth, which is the focus of this dissertation. This dissertation has three components, all related to cultural assimilation. First, it looks at which aspects of the second generation's culture-consumption, attitudes toward education, modes of behavior, and beliefs-are linked to ethnicity. This project questions the common assumption that culture is always ethnicity-linked, by empirically looking at teenagers' cultural choices and behaviors. Second, this dissertation asks whether the local context matters significantly in shaping the cultural assimilation process for second generation youth, or if the globalization of youth culture has made youth in London and New York more similar than different. In other words, which aspects of culture are more local, more global, and more ethnicity-based? Finally, this dissertation research examines the cultural repertoires from which youth draw and the meanings their cultural expressions have for them. In order to answer these questions about second generation immigrant youth culture, I will conduct ethnographic research in two multiethnic secondary schools-one in London and one in New York City. I will conduct 20 interviews each with second generation Afro-Caribbean, second generation Indian, and native White students in each school. Finally, I will ask 100 students to complete surveys in each school. Thus I plan to obtain a total of 120 in-depth interviews, 200 surveys, and two school ethnographies-half in London and half in New York City. This project's broader impacts include the following: The research has implications for developing models of schooling and teacher training that can best serve children in multi-ethnic environments, which are increasingly prevalent. The project will provide teachers, parents, and policymakers greater understanding of youth culture and its relationship with how children engage with school by providing insights into such questions as: What is the relationship between a teenager's style and his/her attitudes toward education? How should cultural styles be understood by schools and teachers? What cultural scripts or behaviors, if any, might be causing certain groups (Afro-Caribbeans in the UK, African Americans in the US, boys in both countries) to underachieve, and to what extent do which cultural assumptions of teachers and administrators contribute to that underachievement? What cultural tools could be taught to underachieving groups to improve their academic achievement, and what types of professional development will help teachers help students? The individual school research sites will benefit from learning how their students think about their cultural identities, especially their attitudes toward education, feelings about success, and skills for achievement."

The project directly addresses broadening participation in engineering education with a unique focus on (1) identifying how environmental factors at MSIs versus Predominately White Institutions contribute to academic and career outcomes for minority students and (2) determining potential differences in outcomes among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), among Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and between HSIs and HBCUs.<br/><br/>The proposed work has the potential to influence how scholars approach the study of ethnic minority students, as well as how they conceptualize and study MSIs, settings that often are marginalized in the study of college students. The fact that MSIs produce a substantial proportion of Black and Hispanic STEM degrees increases the relevance and potential impact of this work. In a broader sense this project considers the relevance of context in student achievement and persistence in STEM, which is a significant issue in the education of all students."

The response to hurricane Katrina makes it clear that local human services organizations, while extremely valuable, are unable to address the full range of needs of disaster victims, and that federal and state governments must provide basic coordination, as well as large-scale resources. By examining both the failures and successes of both governmental and nongovernmental organizations in response to the human crisis the research provides practical insights into the most effective division of roles between different levels of government and civil society. The wide-ranging crisis precipitated by Hurricane Katrina provides the opportunity to better understand the complementary roles of government, non-governmental organization, and the smaller informal networks composed of relatives and friends in determining the long-term consequences of disasters, as well as more chronic difficulties. <br/><br/>The data relate to the period most proximate to the disaster and represent an invaluable baseline on which future research will build. The research team will identify and contact a diverse group of evacuees to Texas and remain in contact with them over time in order to identify how the actions of various agencies influences a family's long-term adaptation. The panel of evacuees will consist of individuals from various racial and ethnic groups and will represent different socioeconomic strata. Ethnographically oriented interviews investigate families' situation and activities prior to the storm, and their activities and movements during the storm and afterwards. The interviews focus specifically on contact with all forms of help providers, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and more informal community and kin networks. The objective is the development of a qualitative database that will make it possible to develop generalizations concerning the different ways in which evacuees sought and received help, and how their strategies related to their race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status, their personal resources and the eventual outcomes. The project includes on-going follow-up with evacuees over the period of a year. The study is being carried out in Austin, Texas, which received a substantial population of evacuees and sponsors a range of helping organizations.<br/><br/>This research contributes theoretically and practically to a better understanding of how both governmental and non-governmental organizations enhance resiliency and mediate the impact of loss on human behavior, social inequities in disaster relief efforts, and the relationship of individual capabilities to the effective access to both government and civil supports and benefits."

Designed as a longitudinal study of lawyer careers, AJD is tracking the professional lives of more than 4,500 lawyers during their first ten years after law school. While prior research has identified that significant gender and racial inequality exists within the legal profession, this research has generally been limited to findings based on particular jurisdictions. Moreover, most prior research is cross-sectional in character, which limits the capacity to explain changes in careers over time.<br/>As a study of lawyer careers, the AJD study seeks to understand who lawyers are, how lawyers build their careers, which lawyers attain elite positions, and whom lawyers serve. The first wave of the AJD project created a set of baseline data that provide a unique perspective on how legal careers are made. The second wave of the project will build on this significant base, collecting data from the AJD cohort when respondents are about six years into their careers and experiencing many important personal and professional transitions. The longitudinal design of the project will allow us to observe more complex patterns that emerge over time, as lawyers gain expertise, change jobs, draw on social networks, and enter new family relationships. The influence of gender and race or ethnicity, in particular, will likely become more pronounced as these lawyers move out of their initial jobs, begin families, and face changing labor market opportunities. The studys minority oversample will facilitate the analysis of the changing effects of race over a professional career. <br/>The second wave of the AJD study will focus on issues of career mobility, tracking movements both within and out of the law. We will seek to understand which lawyers move sectors and settings, and why and how they do so. Beyond its focus on the legal profession itself as an object of study, the After the JD study will address a number of core issues in social science and in law. One is the general pattern of social stratification stemming from social backgrounds, schools attended, grades, and social networks and how these relate to the full range of career outcomes (including practice settings, areas of practice, income and satisfaction). The study is collecting textured data on issues of gender and race/ethnicity in the professional workplace. We will expand our scope beyond factors relating to the workplace, to include issues such as the role of social and community networks, mentorship, and family responsibilities. These data will shed light on the mechanisms that lead to unequal opportunity in employment and the possibilities that inequality may be remedied through legal or other strategies. The longitudinal design will allow us to place legal careers within a broader life course context, providing key insights into the mechanisms that shape professional careers.<br/>The After the JD study will not only document these patterns, but will provide the empirical data necessary for devising policy solutions relating to the role of law schools in the job market for lawyers; recruitment and compensation policies within law firms and in the public sector; issues of the retention of women and minorities in law firms; and to broader questions such as the relative availability of legal talent to individuals and corporations, rich and poor. The study includes the careers of public interest lawyers, who play a key social role through their contribution to social reform and social justice through law. Because careers can be thought of as the mechanism that links the supply and demand for legal services, developing a theoretical understanding of the determinants of lawyers careers has significant implications for the distributive effects of law itself. <br/>More generally, the studys theoretical lens, with its focus on capital assets, will enable us to better understand the mechanisms that lead to unequal opportunity in employment. In particular, our approach will reveal how different forms of capital come together in the construction of lawyer careers. For instance, social class, credentials, connections, organizational leadership, government service, and expertise are all forms of advantage that are accessed and valued differentially across the legal profession. Research to date does not allow us to say which are the advantages that are most useful to occupational mobility in law. The After the JD project, drawing on its theoretical frame and its longitudinal design, will help uncover the professional rules of the game, which, given the centrality of the legal profession to our processes of governance, are vital to the legitimacy of law as a democratic institution."

Oregon State University (OSU) will create an equitable work environment for women and others from traditionally underrepresented groups through a series of new and unique programs. These programs will focus on educating university faculty and administrators about how gender, race/ethnicity, and social class combine to disadvantage women in academic Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The centerpiece will be a new program called Difference, Power, and Discrimination (DPD) where faculty will be educated on how gender-based inequality in the workplace can be removed through changing our behaviors. Activities aimed at recognizing and reducing discrimination of women and underrepresented groups in STEM can be used at other universities.<br/><br/>The goal of OREGON STATE ADVANCE is to transform the institution's climate, structures, and relationships to create an equitable and just workplace. OREGON STATE ADVANCE will institutionalize supportive policies and processes and revolutionize understandings, relationships, and practices by fostering greater comprehension of the roles difference and power play in social institutions. Progression toward this goal will be guided by three major objectives: (1) Recruit, retain, and promote more women STEM faculty across the majority of OSU's Colleges by building upon established initiatives and implementing new policies and programs that will lead to a significant increase of women STEM faculty at OSU; (2) Recognize the importance of gender's intersections with race/ethnicity, social class, and other axes of oppression in affecting women's lives; (3) Develop OSU's Difference, Power, and Discrimination (DPD) faculty development program to provide targeted educational opportunities for STEM faculty and administrators. Theorists have developed a well-defined understanding of systems of oppression. OREGON STATE ADVANCE operationalizes these theories within an effort to transform the institution through changing behavior, relationships, policies, procedures, and structures. Additionally, researchers have found that ""sense-making"" activities further institutional transformation. This project will examine the impact of utilizing systems of oppression theories as a way of helping administrators and faculty understand the ways difference, power, and privilege construct institutional experiences, disadvantaging women in STEM fields. Additionally, the project assesses the effects of understanding oppression on institutional transformation and an improved climate for women in STEM. In very tangible terms, the availability of OREGON STATE ADVANCE individuals and teams to lead DPD seminars at other institutions and the provision of summer institutes and online support resources offer an opportunity for widespread influence for the project. Additionally, the development of a peer-reviewed online ADVANCE journal will further disseminate ADVANCE findings, as well as other research on women and other underrepresented groups in STEM."

Poverty at birth is a condition affecting more than 1 in 4 American children. It is a critical barrier to children's subsequent development and life chances, and therefore to breaking intergenerational cycles of disadvantage. Both mother's and father's characteristics contribute to the chance that a child will be born into poverty. Therefore it is important to incorporate both the mother and father into the scientific modeling of the experience of poverty at birth from one generation to the next. Existing data and methods do not allow for this modeling in representative samples of the U.S. population, especially as it evolves as an increasingly multi-ethnic society. Limited data are collected on the characteristics of every birth in the United States. Limited additional data on all individuals and their households are collected every 10 years in the Census. Larger amounts of data per individual and household are collected every year from random samples that are representative of the U.S. population. These samples include the large-scale American Community Survey and numerous medium- and small-scale sample surveys. This research develops and evaluates statistical estimation and simulation methods to combine data from all these sources to answer questions about intergenerational mobility. The research will answer questions about the degree of persistence of poverty at birth from one generation to the next across different race and ethnic groups, and about the roles of education and family formation in creating upward mobility versus persistence of disadvantage. Open-source, user-friendly software for the statistical methods developed in the project will be made available to researchers. The project also develops graduate students' skills in Big Data methods in statistics and the social sciences. <br/><br/>The project has as its goal the development of a transformative, Big Data approach to exploiting the rich ""traditional"" data sources to build social-scientific theory in a statistically-rigorous and empirically-comprehensive way. In no single nationally-representative data source is poverty at birth observed for the mother-father-child triad. The triad's poverty statuses at each one's birth are instead linked in a model that simulates four connected processes: (1) educational progress predicted from the birth conditions of household poverty and parents' education, race, ethnicity, and immigrant statuses; (2) couple formation and dissolution; (3) couple fertility and unpartnered women's fertility; and (4) household poverty when their own children are born. The ""Big Data"" of this project consist of more than 100 million births, combined with census, microcensus, large-scale cross-sectional survey, and medium-scale and smaller-scale longitudinal survey data sources that together include millions of years of exposure to schooling, to partner-matching, and to partnered and (co-residentially) unpartnered births. These multiple sources of data of the study, unlike in many Big Data applications, are all either complete enumerations or probability samples of a well-specified population. The project develops combined-survey and combined population-and-survey estimation methods to estimate with enhanced precision the individual behavioral parameters of the process, and develops a simulation-modeling approach to generating inference about causal associations that emerge from the four connected processes, integrating the multiple sources of uncertainty about each component process. Results and methodological advances will be disseminated to the scholarly community through presentations and peer-reviewed journal articles. Additional, broader dissemination will occur through project investigator contact with the news media and other forums for engagement with the broader policy community about the project results and their significance."

Until recently, social science research on the impacts of interactions between residents and tourists has assumed a unidirectional power dynamic that resulted from the motivations of tourists and the impacts on residents. But more recent research suggests that residents are not passive in these interactions. This research will explore this possibility through research at a cultural tourism enterprise in the village of Longido, a primarily Maasai community in the heart of northern Tanzania's safari tourism circuit. <br/><br/>The researcher will employ a mix of social science research methods, including observations of resident-tourist interactions, surveys of tourists, and interviews with residents. The data will be analyzed to determine the nature and direction of influence, with a particular focus on Maasai representation of Maasai identity in a cultural tourism setting, Maasai motivations, and its effects on the touristic relationship.<br/><br/>Findings from this research will contribute to theorizing ethnicity as a malleable rather than inherent human characteristic. Tourism is of growing significance developing economies. Understanding tourism processes and relationships is thus critically important. Community-based cultural tourism initiatives, such as the Longido enterprise, have the potential for reducing poverty and encouraging local-level conservation activities but this potential depends on host community autonomy. By exploring the bi-directional nature of the resident-tourist power dynamic, this research seeks to contribute to a better understanding of how residents of tourist destinations shape as well as are shaped by the global phenomenon of tourism. Supporting this research also supports the education of a graduate student."

Two basic hypotheses are addressed: (1) disabled workers are more likely than other workers to be employed evenings, nights or on rotating shifts; and (2) disabled workers are more likely to receive lower wages and less fringe benefits than other workers, particularly if they are working nonstandard hours, and if they are disabled. It is expected that these relationships will hold true in when multivariate analyses that control for differences in social and demographic factors are performed. It is also expected that there will be significant interaction effects showing that the nature of these relationships is conditional upon, race, ethnicity, and gender.<br/><br/>A nationally representative survey, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 1996 Household Component, will be used to test these hypotheses. For the purposes of this study, the sample is limited to individuals aged 18 and over (approximately 14,800 individuals), and will focus primarily on the subset of those employed. This is the first time this federal survey has included information on which hours Americans are employed as well as how many hours. Such data allow for exploratory research to test the proposed hypotheses and lay the groundwork for future sociological research in this area. By considering disability jointly with issues of race, ethnicity, and gender, all in the context of employment during nonstandard work hours, the research will increase our understanding of the nature of social inequality and social stratification-areas central to sociological theory and analysis. Further, the study should better inform public policy seeking to improve the employment situation of disabled persons."

Using direct assessments, previous research has shown that children evaluate racial exclusion as wrong using moral reasons in straightforward situations (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, & Stangor, 2002). In complex or ambiguous situations, children often use a mixture of reasons, such as group functioning or personal choice to justify exclusion. The present studies will examine the ways in which children display implicit and explicit racial biases. Studies with adults have shown that while explicit biases have diminished dramatically over 50 years, implicit biases are still quite prevalent (Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986). Most of this research has not employed measurements that are developmentally appropriate for children; nor do they assess bias in the context of peer situations. Pilot work for the present study established the reliability and validity of two assessments for investigating implicit racial bias in children using ambiguous pictures cards and perceptions of similarity measurements. These instruments will be used in the present investigation to assess children's evaluations of contexts involving cross-race peer relationships. Using the social-cognitive domain model, this research will investigate whether and how children apply racial biases to their interpretations of ambiguous picture cards with cross-race peer dyads, to their perceptions of similarity, and to their judgments about the potential for cross-race friendships. In this assessment, social encounters are depicted that reflect everyday, familiar, social contexts for children, such as situations on the playground, at the park, and in the school yard. In addition, this research will examine how the ethnic make-up of children's school environments influences the extent to which children apply racial biases to decisions about peer relationships. Further, children's implicit and explicit bias will be examined in order to understand whether children who do not demonstrate explicit bias, nonetheless, exhibit implicit biases when asked to make judgments about peer relationships.<br/>This research will investigate whether, and how, children take race into account when making decisions about peer encounters in morally-relevant peer relationship contexts. One study will focus primarily on implicit biases from children attending different schools (homogeneous and heterogeneous), and a second study will use multiple measures to understand the relationships between implicit and explicit intergroup judgments. Given that previous work has shown that different forms of social reasoning are used when evaluating peer contexts, this research will seek to determine if racial biases are brought into consideration when evaluating peer exchanges, guided by developmental social-cognitive domain theory. <br/>The knowledge resulting from this project will enable educators, school psychologists, and school professionals to develop curriculum and intervention programs to address issues of intergroup tensions, and diversity in schools in a developmentally meaningful way. Given the multicultural nature of the workforce and adult world, it is essential to facilitate children's ability to interact comfortably with individuals from diverse backgrounds; a first step towards this goal is understanding when and how children's intergroup biases manifest in various social contexts and situations, and that is the central aim of this investigation."

This study develops highly detailed institutional data from a large Hispanic-Serving public university with a substantial population of historically underrepresented minorities. These data have potential to detect possible differences by race/ethnicity in the relative importance of various factors in student intentions, retention, and completion of STEM degree programs.<br/><br/>This pilot project explores the potential for using existing, large-scale institutional data at the university level to identify factors that may contribute to greater participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. Large-scale analytic datasets including such diverse data on pre-college preparation, financial aid, course enrollments and completions, and demographics of students and faculty are rare. This project will extract, combine, and recode student- and course-related information from multiple data sources to produce new longitudinal, student-level analytic data files, permitting examination of how student characteristics, course preparation and sequencing, and instructional environments interact to facilitate STEM degree completion. Exploratory descriptive analyses utilizing the new analytic files will assess feasibility and appropriateness of applying more sophisticated econometric modeling and simulation-based approaches, towards identifying and evaluating policy interventions to increase participation of underrepresented minorities in the STEM workforce."

Using the longitudinal THEOP (Texas Higher Opportunity Project) database with information making students available at two time points (with a third to come) the project intends to determine the advantages that high school mathematics and science course sequences accrue to: 1) acceptance of colleges of different selectivity, 2) majoring in mathematics and science at the college level, and 3) entering (or leaving) the pathway to teaching mathematics and science. Student data is augmented with high schools and colleges attended making it possible to study salient race/ethnicity differences in course taking, college acceptance, majoring in mathematics and science, and ultimately in choosing to become a teacher. The analysis not only addresses the key questions noted above but also draws on a synthesis of the literature to examine how the results vary by important high school and student demographic characteristics including not only race/ethnicity noted above but also gender, SES, parental college attendance, and aspirations. This project is intended and has promise to provide directions and evidence upon which future studies can be build to look at who actually becomes mathematics and science teachers after graduation as Wave 3 data for THEOP is collected and the study broadened to other states."

Despite the frequency of these events, the periods that immediately precede them--electoral campaigns--have received relatively little attention from political scientists. And even fewer studies have examined how individual citizens respond to campaigns in Africa.<br/><br/>Democracy, of course, requires an engaged and informed citizenry, and the possibility for robust, public discussion of alternate policies and representatives. In the new, often struggling, and certainly imperfect democracies of Africa, it is especially important, therefore, to have the fullest possible understanding of the factors that impact societies' performance on these fronts. As essential institutions in democracies, election campaigns cannot be overlooked. Democracy promoters have focused extensively on ensuring that campaigns in developing democracies, such as those in Africa, facilitate open competition and are followed by cleanly conducted and peaceful elections. These efforts could be further enhanced by data on individual-level campaign effects, which this project will provide.<br/><br/>This project represents a distinctive attempt to identify and measure a broad range of campaign effects in African settings. Extant literature on the subject treats electoral campaigns in Africa as primarily mobilizational. In Africa, party loyalty is often held to be determined by ethnicity or patronage relationships between elites and their poorer clients. Therefore, parties' campaign-time challenge is to encourage those loyalists to turn out at the polls. This project seeks not only to measure these mobilizational effects--and to identify campaign activities that might be most important here--but also to measure two other, largely overlooked, potential campaign effects in Africa. First, the project hypothesizes that campaigns might have important persuasive effects, resulting in individuals switching or developing new loyalties. Second, campaigns might have informational effects; through campaign communications, citizens might gain important knowledge about candidates' and parties' political preferences, and about political institutions and democratic practices more generally. In sum, the project seeks to measure campaign effects on individual citizens.<br/><br/>The project's primary data-collection strategy involves a three-wave panel survey. Participants will be interviewed immediately prior to the launch of the campaign preceding Uganda's 2011 presidential and parliamentary elections. These same individuals will be interviewed again during the campaign, and then once more after the elections. Interviews will be conducted with approximately 1200 randomly selected citizens, from all of Uganda's regions and largest ethnic groups. Participants will answer questions about their exposure to campaign events and communications, including advertising; expectations for voting (in terms of whether they will turn out and, if so, which candidates they prefer); political attitudes on a number of issues; and level of political knowledge.<br/><br/>Re-interviewing the same individuals over time means that the project will be able to measure the extent to which individuals become more politically engaged and knowledgeable over the course of election campaigning. It will also allow the researcher to examine whether citizens enter the campaign period with pre-established and rigid political loyalties, which are unaffected by candidates' and parties' campaign activities, or whether some subset of the population can be ""won over"" during the campaign.<br/><br/>In sum, the findings of this project will facilitate further research in broad areas such as political party development, political communication and mass media, and electoral decision-making in developing democracies."

But, it is not always obvious who the best scientists are to include in a team and whether teams with certain types of scientists have different behaviors or practices than teams with other types of scientists. This project is studying whether teams with different team composition have different behaviors and practices. Some research shows that team composition (such as the gender, ethnicity, or discipline of the team members; also called team diversity) influences science outcomes such as effectiveness and productivity. But, there is little research that examines how team diversity affects scientists' ethical behavior, which is the focus of this study. The ethical behavior of scientists matters because it can determine the quality of the science that gets done, and it can influence the trust that society places in scientists. To answer this question, the awardee will measure team diversity and determine how it affects ethical behaviors related to materials sharing, authorship, and mentoring. It is expected that scientists who work in more diverse teams (e.g., those that include women, members of racial or ethnic minority groups, or individuals from different disciplinary backgrounds) may promote team cultures that include social sensitivity and ideals of community welfare. Therefore, higher team diversity may advance science's effectiveness by promoting more ethical standards and practices. <br/><br/>This project will conduct both qualitative and quantitative surveys of individuals who are part of teams in three NSF programs that fund highly collaborative research: Dimensions of Biodiversity, Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems, and Macrosystems Biology. The project will first perform qualitative interviews on a subset of individuals working in teams funded by these three NSF programs to develop more precise hypotheses about the relationships between team diversity and ethical behaviors. Then, those hypotheses will be tested using a quantitative survey administered to the remainder of the funded teams. The quantitative survey responses will be analyzed using multilevel mediation modeling that accounts for the nested nature of the data (i.e., individuals nested within teams) and that can determine relationships between team diversity and ethical behaviors as well as the factors mediating those relationships. In addition to sharing study results, the project team will develop and facilitate workshops to help interdisciplinary environmental scientists recognize the effects of diversity on ethical standards and practices and facilitate increased diversity within teams."

Children in stepfamilies generally have lower levels of well-being than do children in two-biological parent households and show little or no advantage over children in single-parent households. Most studies, however, have implicitly adopted a deficit perspective and ignored the quality of relationships that children develop with stepfathers. Indeed, a great deal of variability exists in the quality of stepfather-stepchild relationships, with some children developing close bonds to stepfathers and others not. Yet little is known about the factors that promote strong stepfather-stepchild ties, or how such ties can promote children?s well-being. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. This project draws on four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health?a nationally representative study of adolescents followed into young adulthood. The first aim is to identify factors that foster strong stepfather-stepchild relationships, both during the transition to stepfamily living and in subsequent years. The study draws on an ecological-contextual theory that emphasizes the social construction of fatherhood. Specifically, this perspective assumes that stepfathers have the potential to form positive or negative relationships with stepchildren, depending on a variety of contextual factors?many of which have received little or no attention in prior research. For example, the study will test the hypothesis that positive stepfather involvement with stepchildren (as reflected in the frequency of shared activities, open communication, and emotional closeness) is greater when other family relationships (mother-stepfather, mother-child) also are close. Other family contexts that may influence stepfather involvement include race and ethnicity, child gender, years lived with a stepfather, number of prior stepfathers, living in disadvantaged contexts, and the extent of nonresident biological father involvement. The second aim is to assess the importance of positive stepfather involvement for children. A social capital framework suggests the hypothesis that high-quality stepfather-stepchild relationships are positively associated with multiple forms of child well-being. The study will examine three core dimensions of well-being: externalizing problems (e.g., delinquent and antisocial behavior), internalizing problems (e.g., depression), and academic achievement (grades). The benefits of stepfather involvement are likely to depend on a variety of contextual factors. One relevant hypothesis is that stepfathers who enter families in which children have experienced one or more prior stepfathers have a relatively difficult time establishing close relationships that translate into positive adolescent outcomes. <br/><br/>This project focuses on adolescence and the transition to adulthood?critical points in the life course for accomplishing key developmental tasks and avoiding risky behaviors that can lead to long-term problems in adulthood. The project will expand the scope of prior research in the following ways: (1) Contrary to most prior studies, this study will pay attention to the quality of stepfather involvement, not just whether a stepfather is present in the household, (2) This study will be the first to examine how stepfather involvement changes between adolescence and young adulthood and the implications of these changes for children, (3) The availability of nationally representative data with minority oversamples will allow an examination of White, African American, and Latino stepfamilies to a degree unprecedented in the literature. Understanding how race and ethnicity moderate processes within stepfamilies is particularly relevant at a time when the racial-ethnic diversity of the U.S. is increasing rapidly. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Findings can aid in the creation of effective programs and policies to promote positive stepfather-stepchild relationships and enhance the well-being of children growing up in stepfamilies. These findings should be especially relevant to federally funded fatherhood initiatives. In addition, the use of existing national data to provide a broad portrait of stepfather involvement should place researchers in a stronger position to develop new instruments for future surveys of stepfathers and stepfamilies. In addition, the project will facilitate the mentoring, training, and professional development of graduate students who participate in the research."

Although there is now a body of literature on the formal laws and court decisions affecting education, there has been almost no sociological research on how law affects the daily lives of students, teachers, and school administrators. In particular, we do not know whether or how laws designed to ensure equality of education for our nation's youth benefit socially disadvantaged students who rely most heavily on schools for access to life-course opportunities. The study focuses on three arenas of legal regulation that are central to schools -- discipline, civil rights (including sexual, racial/ethnic, and religious harassment), and free speech -- to examine: (1) how law matters in the everyday practices within and around schools; (2) how school actors (students, teachers, and administrators) understand and interpret law and rights in schools; and (3) when and how school actors mobilize (or do not mobilize) their legal rights. Surveys of students, teachers, and administrators are being completed in multiple schools across three different states that have varying legal environments: California, New York, and North Carolina. Comparative ethnographies will be completed in six of these schools (two in each state) that differ substantially in terms of the social backgrounds (i.e., household income and ethnicity) of the students enrolled. Ethnographic data collection (including direct observation and in-depth interviews) focuses on how law and other forms of authority are experienced by students, teachers, and administrators in schools. <br/><br/>This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the role of law and rights in schools. It will significantly extend current work, which focuses on the formal law and court decisions, by providing a sociological analysis of how law and rights affect the everyday lives and opportunities of students, teachers, and administrators. It further explores the extent to which the implementation and impact of law varies across schools that serve socially advantaged and socially disadvantaged youth. This work will contribute substantially to work on rights and mobilization in the sociology of law, to work on inequality and educational opportunity in the sociology of education, to work on the interplay between organizations and their socio-legal environments in organizational sociology, and to the development of a nexus linking these bodies of social science research."

The study is interdisciplinary in that it compares URM career trajectories in two STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines (sociology and economics), and integrates major theoretical concepts from each. The results can suggest strategies to broaden STEM participation for URMs and increase the likelihood of their successful academic career trajectories. <br/><br/>Successful career trajectories in these two STEM disciplines are normatively measured as full professorships at research-extensive universities. As such, a major purpose of the study is to measure specific aspects of the stratification processes and outcomes that may create or re-create inequalities in the academic career trajectories of underrepresented minorities in two disciplines: sociology and economics. As a result of this effort, the researchers will develop two databases for ""evidence-based"" evaluations as well as a model for data collection and analysis that will benefit other science disciplines. The study, conducted by a diverse research team of sociologists and economists, uses a mixed-methods approach to develop theory and measure trajectories of scholars from both disciplines. It will test the interrelationships between several theoretical concepts that the investigators argue are aspects of stratification processes, and whether they are associated with career stratification. The key theoretical concepts that will be tested include the following: human capital and social capital including professional networks and marginality to those networks; ""two worlds"" and the ""color line"" for racial and ethnic minorities; and the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, and gender. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>The study findings are important, first, because of the emphasis on bringing URMs into STEM disciplines so that they can teach and mentor an increasingly diverse body of students as well as bring new perspectives and paradigms to research and policy. These new perspectives may have the effect of increasing U.S. innovation and competitiveness, as well as increasing the number of U.S. participants in specific STEM fields, including the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Second, given that the number of adjunct faculty is on the rise at many institutions, who will obtain and succeed in tenure-track positions? A greater representation of URM scholars as full-time, tenured faculty is particularly important in light of changing demographics in the U.S. population. Combined, blacks and Hispanics represent nearly 30 percent of the entire population, but only 9.6 percent of all full-time faculty members in degree-granting institutions. The study will evaluate current intervention programs designed to increase participation (recruitment) and bolster careers (retention) of URMs in the academy, but also propose new interventions and strategies. The research results will be widely disseminated in order to provide insights into how to improve programs and policies across STEM disciplines, based on interdisciplinary theory from sociology and economics. The study will also train a group of undergraduate and graduate students to aid in carrying out all aspects of the study, including exposure to multiple research methods and types of data analysis."

Are these majors able to enter the science workforce as a result of the concepts, skills, non-classroom activities, and career advice that they gain as majors in the discipline? The PI proposed a two-phase survey to answer these questions. In the now-completed Phase I of the study, the PI learned that the 2005 cohort of graduating seniors strongly agreed that they had learned those hard skills that are conceptually oriented. The were less sanguine that they had obtained those hard skills that are technically oriented, those soft skills that taught them to work in diverse groups, and those mentoring relations that increased the likelihood that they could successful participate in the science work force. The PI is currently developing indicators of specific kinds of human and social capital from the array of skills questions we asked. <br/><br/>In the second phase of the survey of students who graduated in 2005, the PI will investigate the relationship between the hard and soft skills gained from the undergraduate major and those used in early career positions and in graduate school, relative to other factors (including race, ethnicity, gender, parent's human capital, prestige of school, and job search strategies). This 18-month project has four additional purposes. These are: (1) continue to update, make operational, and test the validity of concepts and indicators of human and social capital; (2) analyze the factors increase the likelihood of entering the science (including the social science) workforce and graduate programs: (3) provide assessment tools that sociology departments can use to measure their own students and improve career outcomes for them, especially those belonging to racial and ethnic minorities; and (4) disseminate the study results widely, build departmental capacity to conduct assessments, and to provide building blocks for future research. We expect to find that soft skills combined with social capital are equally important to hard skills, controlling for other factors. <br/><br/>As a result of Phase I the PI created a data set that allows for the comparison of peer sociology programs. In Phase II the PI will add to this data set to determine the factors that increase student's likelihood of science careers. These data can be used to measure and compare departmental success, to compare sociology with other disciplines, and with new bachelor's degree holders as a group (using data from the National Center for Educational Statistics' survey Bachelors and Beyond). Phase I and Phase II instruments, measures, and data will be made available to chairs for comparative purposes, to build their department's research and assessment capacity and departmental accountability to students and other stakeholders."

Mitman (Univ. of Oklahoma) <br/>""Breathing Space: A History of Asthma and the Environment""<br/><br/>Between 1982 and 1994, the prevalence of asthma -- the leading chronic illness among children in the United States -- increased over 60 percent. Asthma's prevalence is disproportionately higher among inner-city, African-American children than among suburban white children, although studies suggest that this disparity is linked more to socioeconomic status and place than to ethnicity or race. While inadequate access to preventive health care has been suggested as a contributive factor in this incidence pattern, in the last fifteen years investigators have pointed to increased exposure to indoor air pollutants such as tobacco smoke and to indoor allergens associated with dust mites and cockroaches in addition to outdoor air pollutants as important environmental factors in the development and worsening of asthma symptoms among the urban poor. In the l990s, asthma has become identified as a disease of the built environment, a chronic symptom of living in an industrial society, where the risks to environmental pollutants are distributed unequally across ethnic and socioeconomic lines.<br/><br/>The built environment has become a subject of increasing interest to environmental historians as attention has shifted away from a historical focus on the ""natural"" environment to urban and industrial spaces. Historical scholarship on the environmental consequences of industrial and urban development has greatly enhanced our understanding of the ways in which changing environmental conditions of the workplace and the city have shaped the economic, political, social, and cultural dimensions of human lives. In addition, scholars have recently begun to historically examine the struggles of scientists and citizens to combat pollution and environmental hazards in the built environment and the integral role that environmental issues have played in political activism for social justice and equality throughout the twentieth century. Despite this recent work, however, and despite the fact that we speak of the environment as though it captures a single entity and diversity of interests, we still have little appreciation for how conceptions and management of the environment of the home, workplace, and recreational area have historically intersected with and diverged from one another.<br/><br/>By looking at asthma through a history of place -- from a therapeutic perspective emphasizing environmental control and management, from an etiological perspective implicating environmental factors ranging from allergens to air pollution, and from the perspective of the patient seeking a better quality of life in the rarefied air of mountain resorts or more recently through environmental remediation of the home and workplace -- this project investigates how environmental attitudes toward places of home, work, and play have interacted in medical, scientific, and popular beliefs about asthma over the last 120 years. Unlike infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and tuberculosis, no magic bullet has appeared for the treatment or cure of asthma. Although pharmacological developments have played an important part in therapeutic management, living with asthma has throughout the late-nineteenth and twentieth century always entailed the control and management of the environment, where asthmatics live, work, and play. By attending to the environmental management that physicians and other caretakers prescribed and that chronic sufferers employed in the alleviation of asthma, this project seeks to elucidate historically changing perceptions of the relationship between the environment and health in twentieth-century American culture."

The research question is: what leadership and organizational features at the school level are associated with mitigating science achievement gaps? Previous school effectiveness studies demonstrate school leadership and social capital influencing student achievement; the SOSA project is unique with its focus on science achievement. Researchers at the University of Connecticut and the University of South Florida St. Petersburg, in collaboration with school districts in their respective states, will identify school leadership practices that can be connected with reductions in achievement gaps related to student ethnicity, English fluency, and social status. At the conclusion of the five-year project, the findings will take the form of recommendations about leadership practices and school organization that can be implemented in other school settings.<br/><br/>The project uses a mixed methods design by combining statistical modeling and qualitative data. Multiple regression analyses highlight those schools populated by fifth graders that have greater or lesser achievement gaps in science. Using social capital theory (i.e., school norms, communication channels, and trustworthiness) comparisons of positive and negative outlier schools will be made via interviews of building principals, classroom teachers and community representatives. The expectation is that schools providing more equitable science experiences to all students will exhibit stronger social capital compared to buildings with disparities in science test scores across demographic categories. These insights will be supplemented by multilevel structural equation modeling to determine the strength of association between various school climate measures (e.g., teacher-to-principal trust, correspondence between teacher and principal perceptions of leadership, and school/community ties) and science achievement as measured by statewide fifth grade science tests. In addition, growth analyses will be used to detect shifts over time and provide insights about the links between policy changes or leadership adjustments, inasmuch as science achievement gaps are affected.<br/><br/>By working with 150 schools in two states, this collaborative research project is designed to generate findings applicable in other school systems. Particularly in settings where science achievement gaps are large, and especially when such gaps vary between schools even when the student populations are similar, the findings from this study will have practical leadership implications. Expertise in this project includes science education, educational leadership, and statistical modeling. This complementary combination increases the depth of the project's efforts along with expanding its potential impacts. Key questions addressed by this project include: to what extent is leadership in science similar to or different from leadership in other subject areas? how do variations in leadership design (e.g., top-down versus distributed leadership) contribute to reductions in science achievement gaps? to what degree can effective leadership mitigate other factors that exacerbate the challenges of providing high quality science learning experiences for every child? Findings will be disseminated via the SOSA Project website, along with leadership development strategies. Deliverables include templates to replicate the study, case studies for professional development, and strategies for supporting the development of science teacher-leaders."

As virtual ""partners"" in interpersonal scenarios, this project implements VHs to augment role-playing and expert-observation for communication skills instruction. Research will be conducted in three stages. First, research will be conducted to effectively characterize a student's VH interaction. This involves tracking the student's primary verbal and non-verbal communication cues (gaze, gesture, posture, words spoken, and audio frequency) and correlating them with medical expert coding of the student-VH interaction. Second, after-action reviews will be developed to visualize the tracked communication cues. Students and instructors will be able to review and replay the student-VH interaction from both the student and the VH's viewpoint. This has the special potential of allowing poor performing students to vicariously experience ""what it was like to talk to themselves."" The after-action reviews will also be used to study VH interactions, understand how people perceive VHs, and provide educators with tools for identifying students that require remediation. Third, student communication with diverse patients will be investigated through analyzing student interactions with VHs of varied ethnic/race, age, and gender backgrounds. Overall, the system will be used to study if the VH's appearance and demeanor impacts behavior, and provide tools for educators to enhance communication skills towards people of varied backgrounds.<br/><br/>With respect to broader impact, this research with virtual humans has the potential to enhance the communication skills curricula of medical, nursing and physician assistant students. Initially, the VH system will be installed at two Southeast medical schools. As part of a communications skills course, students will interact with virtual humans to learn communication and diversity concepts. As the system evolves, presentations at medical simulation conferences will detail how to replicate the VH system at other medical schools and integrate their results into a database of VH interactions. Prior research has indicated that the majority of students reported that they would practice with such a system weekly. Integration into the medical school curricula has the potential to impact thousands of health care students and educators.

The research will yield better information about how colleges vary in instructional expenditures. It will also give new information about variation within and across colleges in family incomes, standardized test scores, and the racial composition of their student bodies. The<br/>research will also characterize how financial aid varies with standardized test scores, family incomes,<br/>race/ethnicity, and other characteristics of students. The researchers will also evaluate how colleges, students of color, and white students value ethnic/racial diversity in choosing a college or making admissions decisions. The research approach entails theoretical analysis and parallel computational and empirical analysis.<br/><br/>The research methods will be adopted to allow for informational asymmetries between colleges and their prospective students, asymmetries that have potentially important implications for admission and financial aid policies. This creates a challenging statistical problem that will require new techniques. Standard approaches used by other researchers to study other markets are not a good choice for analyzing the market for higher education for two reasons. First, product characteristics are endogenous because colleges choose how much to spend on teaching and also influence the composition of their student bodies. Second, because of financial aid prices for a given student type will differ across colleges but are only observed at the college attended. The research team will develop new statistical techniques to deal with these problems.<br/><br/>The research will develops and estimates a general equilibrium model of higher education and uses the model to study public policy issues. The general equilibrium framework is particularly important for study of policy issues that may change the equilibrium financial aid and admission policies of all institutions of higher education. Among the key contributions of the research is endogenizing college qualities in a general equilibrium framework with asymmetric information. Because the college objective function that is modeled and tested differs from profit maximization, this research adds to the theoretical and empirical literatures on nonprofit institutions. The research also contributes to understanding of peer effects by elucidating the way in which peer effects affect college qualities, admissions decisions, and financial aid policies, and by developing empirical evidence about the extent to which observed admission and financial aid policies are consistent with the model's predictions. A further, related innovation in the research is study of the effects of diversity in a general equilibrium framework. Finally, this project is on the frontier of integrating theory, computation, and estimation. <br/><br/>Key public policy elements of this research are study of the effects of federal financial aid policies and study of the role of publicly funded state universities. The research considers the effect of affirmative action policies on student body composition. The research also investigates the effect of federal financial aid policies on college access, taking account of the way in which federal aid policies and college competition lead to changes in aid provided from colleges' own resources. The research will contribute to understanding how state funding policies and admissions policies of public <br/>universities affect access and costs of college. The research thus has the promise to provide a significant advance in understanding and quantifying the effects of public policy on college access and college costs for different racial and socio-economic groups."

In sensing, when they are deformed an electric charge is created in proportion to the deformation; for actuation, when they are subjected to an electric field a shape change is induced in proportion to the applied field. This behavior leads to applications such as ultrasonic imaging, fuel injection, micropositioning, energy harvesting, and microelectromechanical systems (ink jet print heads, microsensors, etc.). Unfortunately the most ubiquitous piezoelectric materials contain lead. The toxicity of lead has resulted in its elimination in paints and solders. Worldwide efforts are now underway to eliminate lead from all devices, including piezoelectrics. The aim of this research is to develop piezoelectric materials that do not contain lead for use in small-scale sensing and actuation applications. The elimination of lead is highly desirable in terms of processing and device fabrication, disposal at end-of-life, as well as opening up new application areas (in vivo sensing and actuation). In addition, this project acts as a vehicle for both recruiting and retaining a future generation of engineers and scientists that is diverse in terms of both gender and ethnicity. By integration with two mentoring programs that bring Oregon high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and the professor together, a pyramid of mentorship in the laboratory is being created and diversity is increased.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The most prevalent piezoelectric material is based on Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3 (PZT). Recent worldwide regulatory restrictions on the use of lead have resulted in numerous groups searching for and examining lead-free replacement piezoelectric materials. The primary candidates to replace PZT are Bi, Na, and K based perovskites. However, to date research has largely neglected taking a thorough approach to thin film implementation of these materials, which is ultimately desired. Therefore a major opportunity exists to provide insight to the significant thin film processing issues and defect-related phenomena in these complex, volatile, multi-cation systems (which are exacerbated by the anisometric nature of thin film architectures). This work is designed to develop synthesis methodologies to high performing lead-free piezoelectric thin films using chemical solution and physical vapor routes. Novel elemental and structural characterization methods are used to understand the stoichiometry and defect equilibria present in these complex materials, and their impact on the ultimate ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. Finally, this program acts as a critical vehicle for both recruiting and retaining a future generation of engineers and scientists that is diverse in terms of both gender and ethnicity. A culture of mentoring in the professor's laboratory is being fostered that enhances the connection of students to the field while also reaching out to recruit high school level students and attracting them to engineering and the sciences. This goal is being accomplished by collaborating with two programs at Oregon State University that bring underrepresented high school students to campus every summer to participate in research projects that are based on deposition and characterization of lead-free piezoelectric thin films."

The investigators are using a game engine, Delta3D, which is open-source software developed by the US military. The game has a vehicle stranded in a remote location away from its base station, with several of its sub-systems malfunctioning. The player must fix the sub-systems by completing a series of progressively more complex tasks that are linked to one or more learning objectives of the course. Both a usability test and an assessment of learner outcomes relative to the course objectives are being used to identify needed revisions to the video game. The summative evaluation, which focuses on the impact of the video games on student learning and attitudes, is examining differences by gender and ethnicity in student outcomes.

Embedded in existing computing education and STEM courses, the project-developed curriculum--Scalable Game Design (SGD)--introduces students to CT through game design and advances them to STEM simulation design. The project builds on a previous NSF-funded ITEST effort, which suggests that a combination of professional development (PD) types (face-to-face, online, and blended) using SGD can result in high participation of diverse students with high degrees of motivation across gender and ethnicity. The study's key goal is to determine the extent to which the use of three models of PD for teaching CT support classroom teaching and student learning, motivation, and performance; thus a replicable model for scaling-up CT education. <br/><br/>Framed within a scale-up working theory that identifies capacity, reach, and sustainability as fundamental requirements, the key research question is: How do face-to-face, online, and blended professional PD models for teaching computing support classroom and student learning outcomes in various school contexts? To address this question, the project (a) develops a highly adoptable middle-school CT curriculum (a structured expansion of SGD) that addresses issues of access, capacity, replicability, fidelity, and cost), integrated into existing computer education and STEM courses; (b) creates a scalable set of game-design activities so that students with no programming background can produce complete and exciting games; (c) builds computational instruments that analyze student-produced projects for CT skills; and (d) investigates the interaction of pedagogical approaches and students' motivational levels, so that teachers can broaden participation. To assess motivation across gender and ethnicity, the study employs established valid and reliable motivation instruments. To measure performance, the project uses Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis, an embedded assessment instrument that measures computational thinking patterns, illustrates divergence between tutorial and student projects, and computes learning trajectories from students' projects.<br/><br/>The project's key outcome is a research-informed and field-tested scalable prototype to promote middle and high school CT based on game and STEM simulation design."

People might say that different groups of people sound ""sing song-y"" or ""talk too fast"" or ""sound loud."" Or, they they might say that they can tell, for example, where they are from, or their race or ethnicity, based on the melody of their voice. However, differences in prosody, as well as how these differences might change over time, have not been studied as much as other linguistic differences. As it is known that people can use prosody to tell the race or ethnicity of a speaker, and use that information in a discriminatory way, understanding the nature of prosodic differences is important to combatting that discrimination. <br/><br/>This project examines the prosody, specifically, the intonation (melodic patterns) of speakers in the Midwest. One important aspect that can cause differences in intonation is a speaker's first language. Moreover, if enough people in a community speak another language, either as a first language or heritage language, it can subtly change the sound of English in that community, even among people who don't speak that other language. These changes might fade away over time in speech production, but even if that happens, people in that community might still be able to understand, and imitate, those differences. Using both production and perception data gathered in Dayton, Ohio, Rachel Steindel Burdin, under the direction of Dr. Brian D. Joseph, will investigate these changes in the use and understanding of first and heritage language-influenced intonation. This project will not only give us insight into how intonation can change and into the processes that are in play in interactions between different languages, but it will also give us valuable insight into the nature of language contact and language change more generally."

These young people include both those brought to the US as children, the so-called 1.5 generation, and the US-born second generation. The focus here is the yearlong religious ritual cycle that these young people engage in both Los Angeles and Solaga. The questions framing this research are: what role do religious and cultural practices among the children of immigrants living in the United States play in the formation of their ethnic, community, national, and transnational identities? How does their participation in activities and practices that extend to the Solagueno community in Mexico affect their identities and notions of belonging to the United States and to their parents' home community? To answer these questions, ethnographic research will conducted in both Los Angeles and Solaga over a 12-month period.

Community-level theories predict that conflict increases when one group threatens the status, authority, or material resources of the other group. That might suggest that the individuals selected as victims would be those whose characteristics pose the greatest threat to prevailing social arrangements -- those who are the most successful. Research on both historical lynching and contemporary bias crimes, however, tells us that it is people who have lower socioeconomic status, fewer apparent social ties, who are chosen as victims, but also tells us that people victimized by more and less severe attacks often differ from each other. This study will help to resolve this tension between theories that explain the emergence of conflict and those that explain both the selection of victims and the severity of their victimization. It will incorporate the social, policy, and economic context of intergroup conflict; the severity of victimization; and the relative and absolute characteristics of victims themselves. It will expand understanding of the role of victim characteristics by allowing the researcher to identify how individual traits are related to victimization itself as well as the severity of attack, once a person has been selected as a potential target of intergroup violence. While lynching is largely an historic practice, victimization based on gender, perceived sexual identity, race/ethnicity, religious adherence, and economic status continues to plague societies around the globe. This project will help reframe our understanding of the dynamics of victimization in multiple ways. The researcher will use historical census records to locate individuals who were threatened with lynching, but not killed, in ten Southern states across a span of 50 years (1882 - 1930). Records for these intended victims, and all other people in their households, will be merged with existing data on people who were lynched, as well as on nonvictim members of their communities. Comparing these groups will allow the researcher to identify the characteristics that put individuals at risk of various levels of victimization. The investigator will also incorporate county-level social, demographic, economic, and political data to determine which community factors placed high and low status people at elevated risk of victimization. Data, including a database and ""case files"" with research notes and historical documents for each case, will be distributed via a public web site.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>This project will promote training and learning by incorporating graduate and undergraduate students at an urban, public university in the conduct, presentation, and publication of research. The quantitative analyses, identifying the characteristics that predicted victimization and its severity, as well as the contextual factors that put individuals with particular characteristics at risk, will help us better understand contemporary bias crime and ethnic conflict. Finally, the interactive elements of the website develops and implements a new model of incorporating broader public participation in the collection of social scientific data, allowing members of the public to conduct their own archival research and contribute to the development of our data.

The challenge of this developmental period may be that normative biological changes and school transitions are coupled with escalating stress in peer relationships. Peers can provide crucial companionship and support during preadolescence; at the same time, they can become sources of considerable distress. Indeed, feelings of social anxiety and experiences of peer rebuff typically peak around middle school, and nearly half of middle school students report that they are bullied at least occasionally. Relatively little is currently known, however, about responses to common peer stressors in preadolescence that may prevent or exacerbate subsequent problems. In this research project, preadolescents' real-time physiological and coping responses to common peer stressors (social evaluation and peer rebuff) will be assessed in a laboratory simulation prior to middle school, and examined as predictors of social, emotional, and academic outcomes one year later. Participants will be ethnically and socioeconomically diverse, allowing the investigators to extend the research to understudied populations. The specific objectives of the proposed research are to: (1) characterize prosocial and defensive coping responses to peer stress; (2) examine theoretically-based associations among coping responses and physiological responses (i.e., sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system responses); (3) investigate how pre-transition physiological and coping responses predict important outcomes across the transition to middle school, including social and school adjustment as well as emotional and physical health, assessed via multiple informants (e.g., preadolescents, parents, teachers); and (4) examine whether stress responses differentially predict middle school outcomes depending on gender, ethnicity, temperament, or earlier peer experiences. <br/><br/>This project will test an integrative conceptual model which proposes that prosocial and defensive responses to peer stress are interconnected at physiological and behavioral levels and related to subsequent social experiences and psychosocial adjustment. Results of the research will improve understanding of coping responses that may protect preadolescents against excessive feelings of fear and humiliation that can disrupt progress toward critical social and educational accomplishments. New discoveries about the physiology of stress experiences and coping responses are also anticipated, informing efforts to tailor interventions to the behavioral and physiological profiles of preadolescents with peer problems. In addition, the project will provide advanced training in interdisciplinary research for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students."

The Partnership campuses<br/>are: Irvine (UCI), Los Angeles (UCLA), Riverside (UCR), San Diego (UCSD), and Santa Barbara (UCSB). The proposed workshops and seminars allow dissemination of lessons learned and best practices that have enabled UCI to dramatically increase hiring of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields during the ADVANCE award (September 2001-present). While excellent progress has been made in recruiting women to UCI, the Partnership will focus on strategies to retain and advance women and minority faculty. The workshops promote understanding, facilitate training, and encourage implementation of the novel programs developed at the Irvine campus and by other ADVANCE initiatives. <br/><br/>Experts on institutional transformation and faculty diversity agree that the top administration must provide accountability for diversity for deans and department chairs to implement effective strategies for recruiting, retaining, and advancing a diverse professoriate. In order for changes to ""filter down"" to the departmental level, higher administrators need to develop strategies for holding deans accountable for their units so that the deans will then develop strategies for holding departments accountable. Chairs are the key link between upper level administrators and the faculty. Department chairs' key role in implementing new policies, like the UC family friendly policies, coupled with the challenge of constantly shifting chairs who may not have gained the interpersonal relations and bureaucratic skills essential for equitable implementation, implies a pressing need for chairs' training. Department chairs, as ""climate regulators"", serve an essential function in ensuring that faculty members who make use of such policies do not experience retaliation by their departmental colleagues.<br/><br/>The University of California is the largest public university in the United States with over 200,000 students<br/>on ten campuses employing more than 8,000 ladder-rank faculty members. The system's student<br/>population is quite diverse, yet the faculty population remains predominantly white and male. In recent<br/>years, many campuses have increased the rate of hiring women and minority faculty members, yet<br/>retention of these promising scholars through the rigorous review process will require that administrators<br/>are capable of implementing new policies (e.g., family friendly policies) while at the same time ensuring a<br/>work environment that welcomes faculty from diverse backgrounds. The Implementation Team involves<br/>scholars and professionals who are diverse in terms of discipline, ethnicity, and gender. The diversity of<br/>this team will be key in implementing a program that appeals to administrators from broad backgrounds<br/>and weaves sensitivity to gender and ethnic issues throughout the planned programming.

Although there is now a body of literature on the formal laws and court decisions affecting education, there has been almost no sociological research on how law affects the daily lives of students, teachers, and school administrators. In particular, we do not know whether or how laws designed to ensure equality of education for our nation's youth benefit socially disadvantaged students who rely most heavily on schools for access to life-course opportunities. The study focuses on three arenas of legal regulation that are central to schools -- discipline, civil rights (including sexual, racial/ethnic, and religious harassment), and free speech -- to examine: (1) how law matters in the everyday practices within and around schools; (2) how school actors (students, teachers, and administrators) understand and interpret law and rights in schools; and (3) when and how school actors mobilize (or do not mobilize) their legal rights. Surveys of students, teachers, and administrators are being completed in multiple schools across three different states that have varying legal environments: California, New York, and North Carolina. Comparative ethnographies will be completed in six of these schools (two in each state) that differ substantially in terms of the social backgrounds (i.e., household income and ethnicity) of the students enrolled. Ethnographic data collection (including direct observation and in-depth interviews) focuses on how law and other forms of authority are experienced by students, teachers, and administrators in schools. <br/><br/>This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the role of law and rights in schools. It will significantly extend current work, which focuses on the formal law and court decisions, by providing a sociological analysis of how law and rights affect the everyday lives and opportunities of students, teachers, and administrators. It further explores the extent to which the implementation and impact of law varies across schools that serve socially advantaged and socially disadvantaged youth. This work will contribute substantially to work on rights and mobilization in the sociology of law, to work on inequality and educational opportunity in the sociology of education, to work on the interplay between organizations and their socio-legal environments in organizational sociology, and to the development of a nexus linking these bodies of social science research."

Although previous research indicates that the stigmatized do not generally experience low self-esteem and psychological distress, there is considerable variability in these reactions across stigmatizing conditions, across individuals within stigmatized groups, and within individuals across situations. This program of research refines the PIs' previous attributional analysis of this variability, using principles of distributive justice to clarify reactions of the stigmatized to social outcomes that they attribute to their stigma. Specifically it tests the hypothesis that a critical determinant of the effects of outcomes that are attributed to stigma is whether those outcomes are judged to be deserved. It also tests the hypothesis that individuals will judge such outcomes as deserved when they view their stigma as a relevant input in the particular domain and that stigmatizing conditions perceived as controllable are more likely to be judged as relevant inputs in many domains than those perceived as uncontrollable. Other determinants of the belief that stigma- associated outcomes are deserved include situational information suggesting that the procedures for determining outcomes are fair, a general belief that the system for allocating outcomes is a meritocracy, or a belief that the world is just. These hypotheses will be tested in experiments involving members of pre-existing groups formed on the basis of race and ethnicity, gender, and weight, as well as members of groups created in the laboratory. Previous research has shown that individuals with stigmatizing conditions, who are the targets of negative stereotypes or prejudice, sometimes suffer from low self-esteem and sometimes do not. This program of research will determine when negative stereotypes and prejudice lead to lower self-esteem among stigmatized individuals and groups. It is proposed that when an individual is rejected or experiences a failure, he or she will consider whether this outcome is due to the stigmatizing condition and whether the outcome is fair, or deserved. Stigmatized individuals are expected to experience low self- esteem when they believe that negative outcomes due to their stigma are fair, but not when they believe those outcomes are unfair. Several factors will influence this judgment, including beliefs about whether they are responsible for their stigmatizing condition, whether the condition decreases their qualifications, whether they believe that the procedures followed are fair, and whether they generally believe that the world is a just place where people usually get what they deserve. By increasing understanding of maladaptive reactions to the disadvantages associated with stigmatizing conditions, this research will place us in a better position to ameliorate these reactions."

This is particularly true of social science research that examines the risk judgments and perspectives of various social groups. Understanding how communities think about, respond to and evaluate environmental risk situations has become an important focus of research in decision analysis and environmental psychology. For more than two decades, social scientists have documented dissimilarities between the public and experts in perspectives on risk problems, but also among various communities in the way in which they respond to and perceive environmental hazards. Groups who differ in ethnicity, socioeconomic circumstances, educational levels and language frequently differ in their reported risk beliefs and reactions to environmental problems. This has major implications for risk communication and the resolution of conflict about managing environmental hazards across the diverse communities affected by exposures. If results of studies are to inform policy in a meaningful way, then scientific procedures used to measure risk perspectives must have demonstrated reliability and appropriateness for all groups, a question of measurement equivalence. Evidence is required showing group differences to be ""real"" and not the result of faulty scientific and measurement procedures. <br/>This investigation examines several risk belief questionnaires and measurement tools used to profile public perspectives on risk problems. Selected instruments previously used will be tested for the ability to produce reliable and valid information for groups who differ in ethnicity, primary language, educational levels and economic circumstances. The investigation will include as participants a variety of African-American, Anglo and Latino individuals residing in lower and middle-income communities. Individuals selected for the study will participate in a series of scientific procedures that will generate information for a statistical exploration of the question of measurement equivalence across groups."

Chapurukha Kusimba, Ryan Raaum, and Sloan Williams will conduct two field seasons of archaeological, ethnohistoric, and archaeogenetics research on the Kenyan coast. The archaeological excavations will be centered at the site of Mtwapa, a prominent Swahili port town dating from ca. 1732 BCE to 1750 AD. Ethnographic research will be carried out amongst Swahili ethnohistorians, elders and other indigenous interlocutors about their origins to identify possible source populations. Archaeogenetic data from human remains excavated from Mtwapa will be compared with African, Middle Eastern and Asian genetic databases. Finally, physical and chemical analysis of ceramic, iron, and trade artifacts, and faunal and botanical remains will be conducted to reconstruct subsistence and technology and to identify relationships both with other regions of East Africa and throughout the Indian Ocean. These new technologies when combined with careful excavations and detailed ethnographic information will allow Drs. Kusimba, Raaum, and Williams to address the following hypotheses: 1) that early Swahili populations, while primarily of African origin, were much more diverse composition than commonly supposed; 2) that some non-African migration to the coast did occur prior to the 19th century 3) that Swahili stone towns were ethnically diverse. <br/><br/>Dr. Kusimba's long-term research agenda has focused on understanding the origin and biological composition of the towns and city-states that developed on the East African coast in the late first millennium CE. Archaeological investigations in Kenya and Tanzania have demonstrated that the artifactual traditions in the early city-states show a clear evolutionary development from earlier villages. Thus preindustrial urbanism in East Africa and elsewhere owes its rise, sustenance, and demise to wider regional and interregional interaction spheres. In the case of East Africa, this development was furthered by relationships with the African hinterland and connections to the wider Indian Ocean trading system. <br/><br/>This collaborative research is addressing key questions, which have important implications for understanding human population relationships both within and beyond Africa. The researchers hope this project will demonstrate the long suspected but still as yet proven shared biological genealogy of East African peoples and their Indian Ocean neighbors. In East Africa, this study may have positive implications for national unity, often fractured by ethnicity and 'tribalism'. The rich historic, anthropological, linguistic evidence coupled with ancient and contemporary genetic data to be collected in this project will contribute new knowledge and open new avenues in interdisciplinary research between archaeologists and geneticists. Additionally the project will train two graduate students, one American Colin LeJeune, and the other Kenyan, Ibrahim Busolo, for their PhD in Swahili archaeology and genetics. It will also enable the recruitment and training undergraduate students in field and laboratory research from Lehman College and the University of Illinois-Chicago."

Employers experimented with dozens of different compliance measures. Many were largely symbolic, such as anti-discrimination policies, while others offered procedural guarantees of equal treatment, such as in dealing with sexual harassment and formal promotion. Still others were more substantive in that they involved positive steps to increase diversity, such as special management training for women and minority mentoring programs. Which of these measures have worked? How did the law matter, and through what kinds of changes in employment practices did it have influence? This project builds on institutional theories of organizational action to address these questions. It distinguishes between symbolic, procedural, and substantive anti-discrimination activities, and specifies hypotheses about the relative effectiveness of each strategy.<br/><br/>The project tests the hypotheses using employment data from the annual reports that 412 large employers submitted to the government from 1978 through 1993. These publicly available reports detail employment by race, ethnicity, and gender in nine occupational categories. It also surveys these companies to chart the history of their personnel practices, and merges the survey data with the annual reports. It then analyzes how particular employment practices of the companies (obtained from the survey data) affect the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of their workforce (obtained from the annual reports). The project represents the first sustained effort to sort out the effects of employment practices on workforce composition, and to measure the effectiveness of activities designed to satisfy anti-discrimination laws in making the workforce more diverse."

In a post-recession context of rising income inequality, the importance of a college degree to the attainment of financial stability remains critical. This project looks at ways to address this continuing problem for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate students in STEM disciplines at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT). The research is significant since college achievement, persistence and career attainment in STEM remain unequal by gender, race/ethnicity, and family income, both within and across group categories. Therefore, this research will examine continuing intersectional inequalities and explore what can be done to improve institutional policies and practices that might be promoting such conditions at VT. This research aligns well with the university President's Inclusion and Diversity Executive Council?s agenda, recently reorganized to advance a bold agenda for providing advocacy for inclusion programs and services throughout the university system.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's (PI) research will capitalize on the inclusion agenda through two overarching goals. The first goal is to identify and examine individual and institutional influences that lead to variance in college persistence, graduation and career outcomes by gender, race/ethnicity, and family income. The second goal is multi-tiered and aims to increase the number and diversity of professionals conducting STEM research through training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students. This goal also increases the use of mixed-methodology by graduate and undergraduate students relative to postsecondary research; career trajectories; and the retention, graduation, and successful career attainment among targeted URM. This study is potentially transformative in that existing studies focus more on monolithic explanations for male or female pathways rather than intersectional inequalities.<br/><br/>The PI builds this project on an intersectional framework combining theories of structure and sociological gender theory to examine how the confluence of individual beliefs (meanings and utility) and institutional practices (policies and programs) in the college context affect student achievement, persistence, and college and degree attainment across categories of difference. The PI will use longitudinal in-depth interviews and secondary survey data to examine these individual and institutional factors. The in-depth interviews will be conducted in five waves with 500 URM undergraduate students. Additional focus group interviews will be conducted by dyads of peer interviewers. Surveys will be specific to VT and include multi-year common datasets as well as those administered to freshman, seniors, and other class levels on student enrollment, persistence, graduation rates, and financial aid. Data from the interviews and surveys will be analyzed to determine what steps VT might take to increase the participation of URM undergraduate students in STEM careers. The findings will also be disseminated nationally and internationally to fill gaps in the literature about how addressing intersectional inequalities might substantially improve URM participation in STEM."

His research involves the generation of skeletal data from several samples from throughout the Chachapoyas regions of northern Peru. With the growing exposure and knowledge of the Chachapoyas region, fundamental questions concerning the population history of the inhabitants of the area can begin to be addressed. Sparked by the discovery of the Laguna de los Condores, this research seeks to understand the growth and development of the people that came to be known as the Chachapoyas. Working under the assumption that biological interactions reflect social interactions, morphological characteristics of the skeleton can be used to discuss changes in population structure and cultural processes. The Relethford-Blangero model of within-group heterogeneity quantifies the presence of gene flow from an external source, allowing discussion of cultural and biological consequences of conquest. Further, with the inclusion of both ethnohistorical and archaeological data, it will be possible to discuss the development of Chachapoyas identity, both before and after their subjugation by the Inka.<br/><br/>At a broader scale, one of anthropology's primary goals is the study of how groups of people interact, not only with other groups, but also with the natural and supernatural worlds that surround them. This research addresses fundamental concepts concerning the expression of group identity within the archaeological record. Previous archaeological research has concentrated upon the distribution of material artifacts to distinguish between cultures and to characterize the contact and articulation between groups. With the growing interest in pursuing the issue of ethnicity from a bioarchaeological perspective, a more nuanced discussion of the archaeological examination of ethnicity is possible."

Smock to develop a strategic plan to guide the development of programs and infrastructure at the University's new biological field station, the Inger and Walter Rice Center for Environmental Life Sciences. The site, consisting of about 350 acres of undeveloped land along the James River near Richmond, Virginia, supports a diversity of terrestrial and aquatic habitats that will greatly enhance VCU's research capabilities, university-level instruction, and outreach education programs for K-12 students and life-long learners. Establishment of this field station, which is only 30 minutes from downtown Richmond, is especially exciting because of its proximity to our urban campus and its ability to serve a relatively large urban and rural population of students of underrepresented ethnicity. <br/><br/>The focus of the Planning Grant is to hold a series of workshops to develop a comprehensive strategic plan for the Center. Participants of one workshop will be drawn from field stations throughout the region, drawing on their experience to develop plans pertaining to administration, data management, and research and education programs at the station. A second workshop will bring together researchers from academic and government agencies to develop potential research collaborations focused on the ecology, conservation and policy issues of large rivers, this being the proposed primary focus of research at the Rice Center. A third set of workshops will focus on outreach education, bringing together appropriate K-12 teachers and administrators from the surrounding school districts, as well as potential partnering organizations and agencies, to develop a comprehensive plan for the development of outreach programs. The outcome of these activities will be a written 5-10 year strategic plan for the Rice Center.<br/><br/>The proposed activities have both strong intellectual merit and broader impacts to the public. Development of the Rice Center, as guided by the outcome of this Planning Grant, will result in a field station with a clear direction toward supporting a wide range of collaborative research activities focused on the ecology of large rivers. The high number of students of underrepresented ethnicities both in universities and K-12 programs throughout the region who will have direct access to programs at the Rice Center is significant. This field station has the potential to greatly impact instructional activities throughout the region and to greatly enhance opportunities for faculty, university-students, K-12 programs and life-long learners."

The research question is: what leadership and organizational features at the school level are associated with mitigating science achievement gaps? Previous school effectiveness studies demonstrate school leadership and social capital influencing student achievement; the SOSA project is unique with its focus on science achievement. Researchers at the University of Connecticut and the University of South Florida St. Petersburg, in collaboration with school districts in their respective states, will identify school leadership practices that can be connected with reductions in achievement gaps related to student ethnicity, English fluency, and social status. At the conclusion of the five-year project, the findings will take the form of recommendations about leadership practices and school organization that can be implemented in other school settings. <br/><br/>The project uses a mixed methods design by combining statistical modeling and qualitative data. Multiple regression analyses highlight those schools populated by fifth graders that have greater or lesser achievement gaps in science. Using social capital theory (i.e., school norms, communication channels, and trustworthiness) comparisons of positive and negative outlier schools will be made via interviews of building principals, classroom teachers and community representatives. The expectation is that schools providing more equitable science experiences to all students will exhibit stronger social capital compared to buildings with disparities in science test scores across demographic categories. These insights will be supplemented by multilevel structural equation modeling to determine the strength of association between various school climate measures (e.g., teacher-to-principal trust, correspondence between teacher and principal perceptions of leadership, and school/community ties) and science achievement as measured by statewide fifth grade science tests. In addition, growth analyses will be used to detect shifts over time and provide insights about the links between policy changes or leadership adjustments, inasmuch as science achievement gaps are affected. <br/><br/>By working with 150 schools in two states, this collaborative research project is designed to generate findings applicable in other school systems. Particularly in settings where science achievement gaps are large, and especially when such gaps vary between schools even when the student populations are similar, the findings from this study will have practical leadership implications. Expertise in this project includes science education, educational leadership, and statistical modeling. This complementary combination increases the depth of the project's efforts along with expanding its potential impacts. Key questions addressed by this project include: to what extent is leadership in science similar to or different from leadership in other subject areas? how do variations in leadership design (e.g., top-down versus distributed leadership) contribute to reductions in science achievement gaps? to what degree can effective leadership mitigate other factors that exacerbate the challenges of providing high quality science learning experiences for every child? Findings will be disseminated via the SOSA Project website, along with leadership development strategies. Deliverables include templates to replicate the study, case studies for professional development, and strategies for supporting the development of science teacher-leaders."

The project also considers the association between strategies and mental health outcomes, with the goal of contributing to the literature on mental health and racial disparity. While the social epidemiology literature provides evidence of the impact of inequality and discrimination on physical and mental health, this project documents how responses to discrimination, namely through anti-racist strategies, can modulate this impact. It also illuminates the role of meanings and cultural structures in the pathways leading from discrimination to ill health.<br/><br/>The project is concerned with the ""everyday"" understandings of anti-racist strategies and with accounting for their range and salience. The outcomes of interest are: A) Accounts of experiences with racism and discrimination and of the emotions brought about by perceived discrimination. B) Accounts of the similarities and differences, and relationships, between members of stigmatized groups and other groups. C) Accounts of strategies used to change the meanings associated with their social identity in response to stereotypes about their group that others have. D) Accounts of behavioral strategies used to gain respect or facilitate interaction with members of the dominant group. E) Effects of perceived discrimination on mental health, as measured by various health indicators. We will explore whether individual anti-racist strategies vary with perceived discrimination: the more frequently and intensely an individual perceives discrimination, the greater the range and salience of evidence s/he will mobilize to demonstrate his/her value. We also hypothesize that the range and salience of accounts will vary across categories of respondents: middle class and working class people; and men and women. Results will be presented in a book written for a larger audience, as well as in scholarly articles aimed at experts on anti-racism, racism, identity, ethnicity, and social movements, as well as experts in the psychological and mental health literatures on coping, anti-racism, racism, identity, and ethnicity, and social movements. The broader social significance of the project is to promote social justice through a better understanding of the cultural processes that may limit the impact of racism on mental health."

This segregation is associated with crime and other deleterious conditions for communities with high concentrations of disadvantaged and minority residents, but carries benefits for more advantaged and White localities. These differential outcomes of segregation have been interpreted as evidence that the spatial isolation of minority neighborhoods produces social problems by creating and reinforcing social and structural isolation. However, most crime studies rely on measures that do not take into account the location of segregated areas relative to one another. As such, they leave unanswered the question of how the inherently spatial nature of segregation is connected with the geographic distribution of criminal activity. This research draws on studies of segregation and its consequences, analyses of geographic variation in crime, and aggregate and multilevel crime research to develop a model that brings space into the analysis of crime. Our broad question is: How does racial, ethnic, and associated economic segregation affect the geographic distribution of crime? Answering this general question entails addressing four specific objectives: (1) developing more refined spatially-based measures of locally segregated (along a variety of dimensions) areas using the best Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data and techniques; (2) identifying what aspects of the physical infrastructure of local communities affect crime; (3) determining how the effects on crime of nearby localities vary across neighborhoods within cities; and (4) evaluating how the effects of local segregation on neighborhood crime varies across cities. Thus, the intellectual merit of the study consists of the light it will shed on the linkages among city-wide segregation, local segregation, and neighborhood crime through meeting these objectives. <br/><br/>The project will analyze data for 10 large U.S. cities for circa 2000: Austin, Boston,<br/>Chicago, Columbus, Fort Worth, Jacksonville, Milwaukee, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, and Portland. The 10 cities cover a range of Black-White segregation, incorporate regional variation, and have relatively large Hispanic and/or Black populations. National Neighborhood Crime Study (NNCS) data will be combined with GIS-based measures of local segregation and physical and ecological characteristics of areas derived from GIS databases on digital transportation networks and parcel- and building-level land use, and other public sources. State-of-the-art GIS analyses and hierarchical Bayesian spatial statistical modeling techniques will be used to evaluate our theoretical model. The modeling strategy is designed to highlight the substantive spatial effects of different types of local segregation (e.g., by race, Hispanic origin, economic status) on crime, while controlling for residual spatial dependence in crime caused by unmeasured conditions. The hierarchical Bayesian approach also permits the within-city and between-city substantive issues to be explored in an integrated manner that accounts for residual spatial dependence. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Substantively, the study will shed light on how a major social process (i.e., segregation) fosters inequality in the prevalence of crime among diverse groups within cities. Beyond its substantive impact, this work will: (1) integrate thinking in three different fields about the sources of neighborhood crime, laying a foundation for future advances in interdisciplinary work on this important policy topic; (2) develop methodological strategies that will serve as models for research in a variety of fields seeking to integrate multiple types of spatial data and concepts; (3) make available to the scientific community newly refined GIS-based measures of local segregation and neighborhood physical and ecological characteristics as supplements to the NNCS; and, (4) provide an attractive topic and diverse mentors for undergraduate and graduate students of color and from economically disadvantaged backgrounds seeking to enhance their ability to conduct research."

In this Communicating Research to Public Audiences (CRPA) project, a dramatic play is used to communicate the findings from the PI's work which resulted in a theory about gender and IT to explain and predict gender (under)representation in IT fields. The play dramatizes constructs of the theory, particularly the ways in which gender, ethnicity, and class affect identity and career and life decisions. Drawing from life history interviews conducted as a part of the research, the storyline of the dramatic play centers on three young women who are graduating from high school and making decisions about their futures and possible careers in IT. Situated squarely in the realm and literature of ""theatre of social engagement,"" this play, and its staged readings and ancillary website, extend access beyond the scientific community to new scientific research on gender barriers in CISE. <br/><br/>Learning goals for the project include:<br/>1. Awareness and knowledge about possible computer and information science and engineering careers; barriers and stereotypes that affect CISE career choice among women; and ""significant others"" such as partners, family members, mentors and teachers who can make a difference at key inflection points in career decision making.<br/>2. Attitude change about the CISE fields being open to everyone regardless of gender, ethnicity, race or class; how one's individual characteristics can be used to resist barriers to inclusion in CISE careers.<br/>3. Intended behavior about learning more about CISE careers and educational opportunities; and responding to negative stereotypes related to CISE. <br/><br/>Evaluation of the proposed project will include observations, talk-back sessions (focus groups) after readings of the play, pre-post surveys administered at the showings, and a second post-performance survey to be administered a certain amount of time after the showing. Dissemination will be through readings of the play for audiences in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, with partnering informal learning venues, and through an associated website which will allow visitors to download and stage the play themselves. Advertisement for the play and the website will take place through websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and websites that promote diversity in computing. In addition, the PI intends to contribute to the scholarly literature on theatre as an informal learning approach and on the findings of how audiences respond to the play itself."

PROMISE is a strong alliance of the three public research universities in Maryland: the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC, the Honors University in Maryland), the University of Maryland, College Park, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore. The mission of PROMISE going forward is to increase significantly the numbers and diversity of Ph.D.s who graduate from Maryland universities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Anyone who supports this mission, regardless of ethnicity, discipline, or status (part-time/full-time) is encouraged to participate in the activities of PROMISE as a partner to achieve the goal of developing highly skilled STEM professionals for the U.S. from a pool of traditionally under-tapped human resources. This alliance calls to action students from ethnic groups that are historically underrepresented in STEM. PROMISE is designed to cultivate and train leaders. By expanding the traditional program model of recruitment, retention, and successful graduation to include a strong emphasis on training and professional maturity, PROMISE seeks to develop students who prepare for leadership in their professions by becoming leaders in graduate school. To build these leadership qualities, PROMISE focuses on communication, public speaking, and other ?soft skills? together with an emphasis on academic and research excellence to empower students to achieve high levels of expertise and skill that the U.S. needs to tackle national technological concerns.<br/><br/>PROMISE: Maryland?s AGEP has been extremely effective at increasing the number of minority doctoral students in STEM disciplines and building a strong sense of community. This was the focus of a previous award and sets the stage for the next phase of activities supported by this award. This alliance has a large number of students in the pipeline to graduate. Therefore, this award will provide funding to continue and augment the most successful recruitment and community building activities of the prior award. The focus of this award is on retention, dissertation completion, and transition to the professoriate. PROMISE will expand existing programs and develop new initiatives based on the successes and lessons learned to serve both the graduate students of Maryland and graduate students around the country. Many of the proposed activities have been piloted, and are poised to move into full implementation.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project addresses the national need to increase participation of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering research careers, particularly in the professoriate. PROMISE: Maryland?s AGEP project will undertake a specific set of activities to address the problem of under representation at each key stage of graduate education with a focus on retention, dissertation completion, and transition to the professoriate. The project builds on the successful track record established individually and collectively by the PROMISE universities that have contributed to understanding what is required to successfully shepherd students through the Ph.D. (Bass et al., 2003; Tull et al., 2003; Tull et al.,2005).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will have broader impacts in four critical areas. Foremost among these is an increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded to underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines. Improving the environment for minority STEM graduate students necessitates a change in the environment for all graduate students. Therefore, the project will have broader impact on graduate education generally, with these changes being institutionalized at PROMISE institutions. Third, the project will provide a broader and more holistic approach to graduate education that produces graduates who are prepared for academic careers. Finally, the project fosters partnerships that lead to impacts beyond PROMISE. This impact is achieved by building partnerships with other NSF funded initiatives such as the recently funded IGERT and engineering research center. These partnerships can achieve broader diversity, fostering connections between faculty at PROMISE institutions and colleges and universities that have a high production of minority STEM bachelor?s degrees for lasting change in recruiting and research collaborations, and building relationships with professional societies and NSF projects outside of Maryland."

Their goal is to understand better the system of relationships and choices at the individual, social group and institutional levels that produce the observed distributions of battle casualties across groups in the society. They plan to examine whether and why casualty representation by group, as well as the larger military manpower pool, varies on a variety of dimensions -- region, socio-economic status, religious preference, race, and ethnicity -- within and among conflicts. Their previous research shows that variations in casualties influence a variety of domestic political process, including individual, mass, and elite opinion formation and elections.<br/> Gartner and Segura theorize that: 1) an understanding of who dies in war requires an understanding of who fights. 2) Initially, those who fight and die emerge from a peactime personnel process that is endogenous to the lessons of the previous conflict, the duration of the peace, economic variables and other factors. 3) Casualties provide information that leads to a wartime process of personnel selection. 4) In each situation, there are individual and institutional factors that affect the demographics of those at risk in war. 5) The relative influence of the peactime and wartime processes is a function of the duraciton and intensity of the conflict and the preceding peace.<br/> Gartner and Segura focus empirically on post-W.W.II American military manpower, and casualties from the Korean, Vietnam and Gulf wars. They use three distinct types of data. First, they use data from the National Archives and Records Administration, including the Korean Conflict Casualties file and the South East Asia Casualties file. Second, data on unemployment, population, and other socio-economic variables are drawn from the Millennial Edition of the Historical Statistics of the United States. Finally, new data, including a continuous measure of civilian-military pay differentials and serial data on inductions, aggregated by race, religion, region and ethnicity are collected from archival sources available from the Department of Defense and state draft boards.<br/> Three sets of hypotheses are tested. First, testable arguments are offered about the demographics of manpower across the entire post-W.W.II era, drawing on general concepts such as economic performance and institutional aspects of conscription. Then, they examine the role of casualties, both as a dependent variable and, when lagged, as an independent variable. Finally, they address specific issues about African-Americans and Latinos in Vietnam and Korea.<br/> For each group of interest (minority, religion), Garner and Saguaro employ a cross-sectional time series analysis to determine, first, if there is variation between the group's share of the total population, military manpower pool, and wartime casualties. Second, they use multivariate analysis to determine which factors best explain the deviation between these representations. Finally, they attempt to identify the determinants of variation in these deviations across time and space. For example, they examine African-American representation in society, the military, and among causalities nationally and across states, and in each case across time.<br/> The normative and policy implications of the study are considerable. A principal tenet of democratic thought is that the benefits and costs of membership in the body politic are visited equally on the citizenry. If one or more social groups bear a disproportionate share of these costs, and this inequity is endemic in the institutional arrangements of society, then there are clear implications for the legitimacy of the system and it ability to use force effectively and in a manner consistent with the preferences of its population."

The research question is: what leadership and organizational features at the school level are associated with mitigating science achievement gaps? Previous school effectiveness studies demonstrate school leadership and social capital influencing student achievement; the SOSA project is unique with its focus on science achievement. Researchers at the University of Connecticut and the University of South Florida St. Petersburg, in collaboration with school districts in their respective states, will identify school leadership practices that can be connected with reductions in achievement gaps related to student ethnicity, English fluency, and social status. At the conclusion of the five-year project, the findings will take the form of recommendations about leadership practices and school organization that can be implemented in other school settings. <br/><br/>The project uses a mixed methods design by combining statistical modeling and qualitative data. Multiple regression analyses highlight those schools populated by fifth graders that have greater or lesser achievement gaps in science. Using social capital theory (i.e., school norms, communication channels, and trustworthiness) comparisons of positive and negative outlier schools will be made via interviews of building principals, classroom teachers and community representatives. The expectation is that schools providing more equitable science experiences to all students will exhibit stronger social capital compared to buildings with disparities in science test scores across demographic categories. These insights will be supplemented by multilevel structural equation modeling to determine the strength of association between various school climate measures (e.g., teacher-to-principal trust, correspondence between teacher and principal perceptions of leadership, and school/community ties) and science achievement as measured by statewide fifth grade science tests. In addition, growth analyses will be used to detect shifts over time and provide insights about the links between policy changes or leadership adjustments, inasmuch as science achievement gaps are affected. <br/><br/>By working with 150 schools in two states, this collaborative research project is designed to generate findings applicable in other school systems. Particularly in settings where science achievement gaps are large, and especially when such gaps vary between schools even when the student populations are similar, the findings from this study will have practical leadership implications. Expertise in this project includes science education, educational leadership, and statistical modeling. This complementary combination increases the depth of the project's efforts along with expanding its potential impacts. Key questions addressed by this project include: to what extent is leadership in science similar to or different from leadership in other subject areas? how do variations in leadership design (e.g., top-down versus distributed leadership) contribute to reductions in science achievement gaps? to what degree can effective leadership mitigate other factors that exacerbate the challenges of providing high quality science learning experiences for every child? Findings will be disseminated via the SOSA Project website, along with leadership development strategies. Deliverables include templates to replicate the study, case studies for professional development, and strategies for supporting the development of science teacher-leaders."

This proposed project has two major research questions: 1) What is the level of scientific literacy of pre and early freshmen STEM majors as it relates to individual STEM competencies, and what is the relationship between the level of scientific literacy and student success, gender and ethnicity? And 2) What are the most effective educational/pedagogical methods for students to learn scientific literacy?<br/><br/>The study will be conducted at different types of institutions of higher education, and research will be conducted to develop an appropriate scientific literacy assessment tool that specifically assesses STEM competencies (e.g, conceptual knowledge, abilities, aptitudes, behaviors and STEM self-efficacy) that facilitate completion of a STEM major. Data will be collected over a network of 15 higher education institutions representing a broad range of race and ethnicities, especially African American male students. <br/><br/>The development of an inclusive, nationally recognized assessment tool, in addition to the proposed tested educational strategies for the instruction of scientific literacy concepts, has the potential to improve the success and graduate rate of students from both majority and minority populations interested in STEM careers."

Lewis<br/><br/> This is a project to evaluate the long-term impact of African American parents' ethnicity and racial identity on their parenting styles with infants and toddlers. The project expands Ron Rohner's theory of parental acceptance and rejection to include the racial context of African American children's development. The Principal Investigator argues there are intense emotions associated with being accepted or rejected or teased about phenotypic racial features by various members of the child's family and social networks. Phenotypic racial features -- skin color, hair texture, nose and lip size -- may have been an ongoing source of ridicule, pride or shame to during the parent's early childhood. These early intense emotional experiences associated with race compose the parent's ethnobiography. Their ethnobiography includes their ethnic identity, early childhood experiences of racial acceptance and rejection and internalized stereotypes. We also propose that the best culturally valid context to study the interactions between parents and children is to use the racially charged task of hair combing. <br/> Several exploratory and pilot studies have been conducted by the P.I. over the past several years using a questionnaire based on this theory and using the hair-combing task. The findings from these pilot studies suggest that early experiences of racial acceptance and rejection are associated with depression and anxiety, feelings of security and insecurity, self-esteem, and racial identity and racial pride in adult African American mothers. Further, early experiences of racial rejection were associated with higher levels of internalized stereotypes about Blacks. A pilot study funded by a grant from the National Institute of Mental health was conducted with 41 mother-child dyads and examined the robustness of Hair Combing Task (in conjunction with a teaching task and free play task) as a viable context to evaluate parenting styles. <br/>The current project is to plan research and to develop the measures. The primary research questions to be addressed are: 1).""Is there a relationship between African American parents' ethnobiographies and their current childrearing beliefs and attitudes about children? 2). What is the relationship of African American parents' early experiences of racial acceptance and rejection with their parenting styles with their children?"" The goal is to develop a scientifically rigorous project to replicate and expand the previous research findings."

The persistent confusion over the place of ""race"" in the sciences as well as its social, biological, genetic, and epidemiological<br/>validity, or invalidity, will be explored. Taking the example of African-American hypertension and heart failure, the research component of this postdoctoral grant will consist of an ethnographic, multi-sited study on the appearance of, and justification for, the first ethnically marked pharmaceutical drug called BiDil. This ""African-American drug"" is currently in its first year of a two-year medical trial at over 100 clinical sites in the U.S. and is produced by Bedford, MA based NitroMed, Inc. Relying on methods of multi-sited fieldwork (Heath et al. 1999; Rapp 1999), I will conduct participant observation at one or more trial sites in the New York area to learn how both doctors and patients understand ""African-American hypertension"" as a different disease than that of its ""Caucasian"" counterpart. This aspect of the fieldwork will be complemented by participant observation and interviews with geneticists researching SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) as markers of biological difference crucial to pharmacogenomics. The controversy over whether or not phenotypic traits can scientifically belie one' genetic constitution regarding drug metabolizing enzymes has recently brought the usage of race in science to the fore in The New England Journal of Medicine (Exner et al. 2001; Yancy et al. 2001) where many of those working on BiDil<br/>have published key papers justifying their all Black study, The African-American Heart Failure Trial (Dries et al. 1999; Exner et al. 2001). Geneticists publishing in Nature Genetics have upped their criticism of race as a surrogate marker for genetic difference due to the NEJM debates (Editorial 2001). By interviewing spokespeople for biotechnology companies working on SNP mapping for pharmacogenomics purposes,<br/>scientific advisors on NitroMed, Inc.'s BiDil trial, cardiologists, hypertension specialists, members of the Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC), patients, and patient advocate group members, I will chronicle the deployment of race and other markers (such as SNPs) as each potentially inflect new social understandings of difference, identity, and health in the post-genomic age. This Postdoctoral Research and Training Fellowship, to be carried out at New York University under the sponsorship of senior Professor of Anthropology Rayna Rapp for 18 months, and at the University of London, Goldsmith College with Professor of Sociology Nikolas Rose for 6 months, is both timely and pertinent. The field of pharmacogenomics is just emerging, while questions on the responsible use of the concept of race --selectively resisted in both the life and social<br/>sciences--demand more detailed interdisciplinary scholarship. This project will build upon the work of researchers in medical anthropology and sociology interested in the intersection of various social and biological markers of difference, such as ethnicity and disease genes. It will furthermore contribute to research in the social studies of science concerned with the co-production of disease, identity, technology, and market."

Anthropologists have used patterns of genetic variation in human populations to infer past human migrations and divergences between populations. Genetic data also have been used to distinguish between natural selection, human behavior, and random events, as influences on human evolution at the molecular level. <br/><br/>However, patterns that are apparently indicative of evolutionary forces may instead be artifacts of biases towards the inclusion of particular types of genetic variants in a study. Biases can be introduced during the discovery of testable genetic variants or during the design of databases or gene chips. In this project, the researchers will examine the extent to which biases in the design of current public databases of human genetic variation (i.e. HapMap) and the latest tools for gathering genetic data (gene chips or microarrays) affect results of molecular anthropology studies. They ask whether or not pre-made gene chips and genetic databases widely used by the medical community for gene mapping are appropriate for inferring population history and human evolution, within what types of populations significant effects of bias would be expected, and the nature and consequences of such bias.<br/><br/>As an example, this research will use predominantly Southeast Asian populations which were underrepresented in the original studies of the human genome and development of current gene mapping technologies. Saliva samples will be collected from individuals as a source of DNA from a minimum of four ethnic minorities (Akha, Lisu, Lahu, Hmong, or Karen), commonly referred to as Hill Tribes, residing in Northern Thailand. These populations are of interest because they are known to have complex migratory histories throughout Asia, and individuals are unlikely to marry outside of their ethnicity. DNA from other Asian and non-Asian majority populations is already available for use in this study. Genetic variation within and between each population will be measured, and this information will be compiled to create artificial simulated populations with which to test hypotheses, which will help the researchers to understand actual observations better. Results will then be analyzed for evidence of known kinds of evolutionary events for each group of genetic variants. Comparison of the results will show what types of biases have significant affects on such inferences, and allow for a more comprehensive genetic characterization of the populations under study.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study include describing the extent to which the accuracy of scientists' views of human dispersal and population history may be affected by biases in widely-available genotyping tools and databases originally designed for gene mapping. This project will also facilitate international (Thailand and United States), interdisciplinary (Anthropology, Psychiatry, and Genetics), and institutional (New York University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Yale University School of Medicine) collaborations. Both samples and data collected for this study will be used for graduate student training of American and Thai researchers, with the intent to continue this international collaboration in the future."

Although there is now a body of literature on the formal laws and court decisions affecting education, there has been almost no sociological research on how law affects the daily lives of students, teachers, and school administrators. In particular, we do not know whether or how laws designed to ensure equality of education for our nation's youth benefit socially disadvantaged students who rely most heavily on schools for access to life-course opportunities. The study focuses on three arenas of legal regulation that are central to schools -- discipline, civil rights (including sexual, racial/ethnic, and religious harassment), and free speech -- to examine: (1) how law matters in the everyday practices within and around schools; (2) how school actors (students, teachers, and administrators) understand and interpret law and rights in schools; and (3) when and how school actors mobilize (or do not mobilize) their legal rights. Surveys of students, teachers, and administrators are being completed in multiple schools across three different states that have varying legal environments: California, New York, and North Carolina. Comparative ethnographies will be completed in six of these schools (two in each state) that differ substantially in terms of the social backgrounds (i.e., household income and ethnicity) of the students enrolled. Ethnographic data collection (including direct observation and in-depth interviews) focuses on how law and other forms of authority are experienced by students, teachers, and administrators in schools. <br/><br/>This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the role of law and rights in schools. It will significantly extend current work, which focuses on the formal law and court decisions, by providing a sociological analysis of how law and rights affect the everyday lives and opportunities of students, teachers, and administrators. It further explores the extent to which the implementation and impact of law varies across schools that serve socially advantaged and socially disadvantaged youth. This work will contribute substantially to work on rights and mobilization in the sociology of law, to work on inequality and educational opportunity in the sociology of education, to work on the interplay between organizations and their socio-legal environments in organizational sociology, and to the development of a nexus linking these bodies of social science research."

The initial project includes an interdisciplinary workshop and a resulting volume of essays, which is designed to initiate comparative research on the ways in which different societies respond to children born as a result of wartime rape. NSF funding will allow participation in the project by non-North American scholars who would otherwise be unable to travel to the workshop.

A burgeoning literature has identified the ways in which gender violence in armed conflict relates to broader socio-political upheavals, but very little has been written on the role played by children born of such violence, or ways in which human communities adapt to an influx of such children after armed conflict. The study's results will be disseminated through an edited volume, a policy paper and conference presentations and has the potential to impact scholarship on identity, aggression and inter-ethnic violence, as well as policy initiatives to mitigate the impact of these dynamics on human groups after conflict. Moreover, by actively involving scholars and practitioners from non-Western contexts in the theory-building and research enterprise, the project will broaden the participation of geographically under-represented groups and broaden our insights about the complexity of these social dynamics."

This project integrates the use of NMR instrumentation and modeling software throughout the chemistry curriculum in order to enhance the undergraduate experience. Students are being intellectually challenged by being exposed to more sophisticated tools that illustrate the material encountered in the classroom. They also are using these applications in the undergraduate research program. The use of NMR instrumentation has become essential in biology, biochemistry, and the health professions, in addition to all areas of chemistry. Use of NMR has been deemed essential in the undergraduate curriculum by the American Chemical Society Committee on Professional Training and is cited as necessary by the Committee on Undergraduate Biology Education to Prepare Research Scientists for the 21st Century, Board on Life Sciences, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council of the National Academies. In this project, use of the Anasazi EFT 60 MHz instrument is allowing meaningful applications of NMR to be integrated into the undergraduate curriculum. Spartan modeling software is being used to integrate modeling throughout the curriculum by taking advantage of the numerous successful applications developed elsewhere to create a set of activities appropriate for our institution. <br/>Broader Impact. The results of this project will be disseminated by the involved faculty and students through presentations at conferences, publications in educational journals and posting on our web site. Our students have a history of being very active in presenting the results of their undergraduate research projects at regional and national conferences. In addition, representatives from industry and from academic institutions who are experts in NMR and scientific education are serving on an Advisory Committee to provide expertise for the project. Finally, an East Texas Anasazi Users Group has been formed that is serving to build an important community among these NMR users, including both four-year and two-year institutions. <br/>A diverse group of students is being impacted by this project. The student body at the University of St. Thomas reflects the diversity of the City of Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast in race/ethnicity, gender, age, religious affiliation, and socioeconomic status. Over the last five years the Hispanic student enrollment has increased by 30%, and the ethnic breakdown of the student body now includes 14% Asian Pacific Islander, 6% Black non-Hispanic, and 33% Hispanic, making the University a Hispanic Serving Institution. In addition, the number of students taking chemistry courses at the institution has been increasing over the last several years with a current level of approximately 100 declared majors in chemistry and biology."

A study of the presence and, equally telling, the strategic absence of a spoken local variety of German in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, can indicate how speakers enter into national discourses of equal rights, what it means to be a group with a distinct history or ethnicity, and ultimately what it means to be a minority group. In 1824 the first immigrants from Hunsruck (an area in the southwest of today''s Germany) arrived in Rio Grande do Sul to face a harsh physical environment and hostilities from indigenous and neighboring peoples. Today, some 700,000 people in Rio Grande do Sul speak Hunsruckisch German, the last significant wave of German immigrants having arrived just after World War II. <br/><br/>The research will use ethnographic and formal linguistic research methods to analyze how speech styles relate to nonlinguistic (aesthetic) styles, and how these relate to the representation of other ethnic minorities in Brazil. Data will be gathered by living with Hunsruckisch speakers in two different sites, accompanying them to gatherings that nonHunsruckisch speakers attend as well, and pursuing archival research. Linguistic samples will be recorded in both formal and informal contexts and the data will be analyzed for formal variation of specific linguistic features.<br/><br/>The research is important because it will aid in the understanding of the implications of immigrant identity for social relations and policy, and the role of language in a multilinguistic context in constructing it. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."

The project will enhance basic understanding about religion, ethnicity, and conflict by testing hypotheses about different mechanisms through which religion may shape conflict. It will extend and integrate theoretical perspectives in political science, economics, anthropology, and social psychology that connect religion and conflict. It also will assess the motivations and processes though which some religiously infused, low-power groups engage in asymmetrical conflict against groups that seemingly are much more powerful. The project will help fill a significant gap in knowledge for U.S. and international agencies and organizations by providing insights and information regarding the ways in which groups differ in their religious infusion and how these differences translate into group conflict. These insights will assist policy makers and practitioners in identifying factors that create or mitigate conflicts. As recent events have demonstrated, enhanced understanding of the causes, facilitators, and inhibitors of asymmetric conflict between groups having great disparity in power has great significance for enhancing the national security of the U.S. and other nations. The project also will provide interdisciplinary education and training opportunities for students in a range of different settings.<br/><br/>The investigators will conduct this project using three complementary methods in order to test nine hypotheses about the ways through which differences in religious ritual, doctrine, and context affect the motivations and capacities of weak, religiously infused groups to initiate conflict against stronger groups.

They will conduct qualitative comparative analyses of 40 relatively resource-weak groups around the world, and they will conduct laboratory-based experimentation in the U.S. and India. These approaches will elucidate the factors shaping the circumstances in which resource-poor, religiously infused groups engage in asymmetric conflict, and they will facilitate identification of the circumstances in which religious infusion may lead to more peaceful outcomes.

Contemporary scientific studies of these communities are struggling to explain how the members of these indigenous groups negotiate the various legal and political frameworks of the different territorial, municipal, regional, and state authorities within which they overlap. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous, empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, explores how these communities engage in territorial recognition when it bridges the borders of nation-states, a level of complexity that has hitherto not been significantly investigated. <br/><br/>Rocio Gil Martinez de Escobar, under the supervision of Dr. Marc Edelman of the City University of New York Graduate Center, explores the production and reproduction of Mascogo-Seminole sovereignty across the Mexico-United States border. Using a range of ethnographic methods of data collection and analysis including participant observation, oral history, and interviews, the project examines the strategic negotiations of the Mascogo-Seminole people with Mexico and the United States to achieve dual citizenship and to freely cross the international border. This case sheds light on the historical production of the Mexico-US border in the region of Texas-Coahuila through the particular lens of indigeneity, race, and ethnicity. It looks at the ways through which competing forms of racial and ethnic classification, as defined by two very different states, historically produce peoples in the borderlands. It offers a view into struggles of people divided by international borders and the possibilities of alternative practices of sovereignty that transcend nation-states: forms of transborder political organization, identification, flow of economic resources, etc. Finally, this research sheds light on the mechanisms through which ideas about race and indigeneity, and the rights attached to them, are established in the borderlands and how this may influence the political and legal practices of both nation-states. As such, in addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would provide data useful to policymakers and planners interested into the formulation and reform of border policy."

Yet scientists' appreciation for the processes that underlie early learning and educational adaptation has outpaced our understanding of these mechanisms. As a result, efforts to foster early school success for all children have been hampered. Children's mental representations (i.e., beliefs about self and other) and self-regulatory functioning (i.e., abilities to control emotions, behaviors, and physiology in accordance with contextual demands) are central mechanisms of both positive and problematic development. However, the individual and interactive contributions of representational and regulatory processes to early school success warrant further clarification. Children's self- and other-representations and their abilities to self-regulate are essential to their successful navigation of the worlds of peers, teachers, and learning. Moreover, representational and regulatory systems constitute core mechanisms by which experiential learning in the family transfers to the school setting. This investigation will trace the development and organization of representational and regulatory systems across the preschool period to clarify their individual and interactive contributions to early learning and school adjustment. Employing annual observations of parents, children, and parent-child interaction along with concurrent reports from children's teachers, this study will follow 240 4-year-old children from diverse backgrounds (i.e., 50% poverty; 50% Hispanic, 30% Black, and 15% White; variable exposure to stress and adversity) across the transition into second grade. Measures will assess representational and regulatory processes across multiple systems, including cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physiological levels of analysis, to 1) trace the development of representational and regulatory processes across the early school years, 2) evaluate their individual and interactive contribution to educational adaptation, and 3) clarify if and how contextual factors, such as parenting, ethnicity, income and adversity, influence expected relations between representation, regulation, and the transition to formal schooling.<br/><br/>This investigation will refine and expand our understanding of children's early learning and adaptation by tracing patterns of continuity and change within and across representational and regulatory systems across the early school years. In so doing, this research will contribute to our understanding of how children learn and, by extension, to innovative efforts that foster early learning and educational competence, particularly among children who are at disproportionate risk for school failure as a function of poverty, ethnicity, or adversity exposure. The transition to school constitutes a unique period of vulnerability to developmental influence, for better or worse, with powerful implications for youths' long term learning and success. By clarifying the interactions among context, representation, regulation and educational adjustment, this investigation will elucidate pathways of educational risk and resilience that will inform culturally and contextually sensitive efforts to facilitate children's safe passage across this critically important developmental transition."

Chapurukha Kusimba, Ryan Raaum, and Sloan Williams will conduct two field seasons of archaeological, ethnohistoric, and archaeogenetics research on the Kenyan coast. The archaeological excavations will be centered at the site of Mtwapa, a prominent Swahili port town dating from ca. 1732 BCE to 1750 AD. Ethnographic research will be carried out amongst Swahili ethnohistorians, elders and other indigenous interlocutors about their origins to identify possible source populations. Archaeogenetic data from human remains excavated from Mtwapa will be compared with African, Middle Eastern and Asian genetic databases. Finally, physical and chemical analysis of ceramic, iron, and trade artifacts, and faunal and botanical remains will be conducted to reconstruct subsistence and technology and to identify relationships both with other regions of East Africa and throughout the Indian Ocean. These new technologies when combined with careful excavations and detailed ethnographic information will allow Drs. Kusimba, Raaum, and Williams to address the following hypotheses: 1) that early Swahili populations, while primarily of African origin, were much more diverse composition than commonly supposed; 2) that some non-African migration to the coast did occur prior to the 19th century 3) that Swahili stone towns were ethnically diverse. <br/><br/>Dr. Kusimba's long-term research agenda has focused on understanding the origin and biological composition of the towns and city-states that developed on the East African coast in the late first millennium CE. Archaeological investigations in Kenya and Tanzania have demonstrated that the artifactual traditions in the early city-states show a clear evolutionary development from earlier villages. Thus preindustrial urbanism in East Africa and elsewhere owes its rise, sustenance, and demise to wider regional and interregional interaction spheres. In the case of East Africa, this development was furthered by relationships with the African hinterland and connections to the wider Indian Ocean trading system. <br/><br/>This collaborative research is addressing key questions, which have important implications for understanding human population relationships both within and beyond Africa. The researchers hope this project will demonstrate the long suspected but still as yet proven shared biological genealogy of East African peoples and their Indian Ocean neighbors. In East Africa, this study may have positive implications for national unity, often fractured by ethnicity and 'tribalism'. The rich historic, anthropological, linguistic evidence coupled with ancient and contemporary genetic data to be collected in this project will contribute new knowledge and open new avenues in interdisciplinary research between archaeologists and geneticists. Additionally the project will train two graduate students, one American Colin LeJeune, and the other Kenyan, Ibrahim Busolo, for their PhD in Swahili archaeology and genetics. It will also enable the recruitment and training undergraduate students in field and laboratory research from Lehman College and the University of Illinois-Chicago."

They plan to examine whether and why casualty representation by group, as well as the larger military manpower pool, varies on a variety of dimensions -- region, socio-economic status, religious preference, race, and ethnicity -- within and among conflicts. Their previous research shows that variations in casualties influence a variety of domestic political process, including individual, mass, and elite opinion formation and elections.<br/> Gartner and Segura theorize that: 1) an understanding of who dies in war requires an understanding of who fights. 2) Initially, those who fight and die emerge from a peactime personnel process that is endogenous to the lessons of the previous conflict, the duration of the peace, economic variables and other factors. 3) Casualties provide information that leads to a wartime process of personnel selection. 4) In each situation, there are individual and institutional factors that affect the demographics of those at risk in war. 5) The relative influence of the peactime and wartime processes is a function of the duraciton and intensity of the conflict and the preceding peace.<br/> Gartner and Segura focus empirically on post-W.W.II American military manpower, and casualties from the Korean, Vietnam and Gulf wars. They use three distinct types of data. First, they use data from the National Archives and Records Administration, including the Korean Conflict Casualties file and the South East Asia Casualties file. Second, data on unemployment, population, and other socio-economic variables are drawn from the Millennial Edition of the Historical Statistics of the United States. Finally, new data, including a continuous measure of civilian-military pay differentials and serial data on inductions, aggregated by race, religion, region and ethnicity are collected from archival sources available from the Department of Defense and state draft boards.<br/> Three sets of hypotheses are tested. First, testable arguments are offered about the demographics of manpower across the entire post-W.W.II era, drawing on general concepts such as economic performance and institutional aspects of conscription. Then, they examine the role of casualties, both as a dependent variable and, when lagged, as an independent variable. Finally, they address specific issues about African-Americans and Latinos in Vietnam and Korea.<br/> For each group of interest (minority, religion), Garner and Saguaro employ a cross-sectional time series analysis to determine, first, if there is variation between the group's share of the total population, military manpower pool, and wartime casualties. Second, they use multivariate analysis to determine which factors best explain the deviation between these representations. Finally, they attempt to identify the determinants of variation in these deviations across time and space. For example, they examine African-American representation in society, the military, and among causalities nationally and across states, and in each case across time.<br/> The normative and policy implications of the study are considerable. A principal tenet of democratic thought is that the benefits and costs of membership in the body politic are visited equally on the citizenry. If one or more social groups bear a disproportionate share of these costs, and this inequity is endemic in the institutional arrangements of society, then there are clear implications for the legitimacy of the system and it ability to use force effectively and in a manner consistent with the preferences of its population."

Some products are produced regionally, most come from distant corners of the world. Recent studies on agricultural commodity chains in the United States suggest that homogenization and corporate appropriation are associated with spatial expansion. Yet within New York City methods of food procurement are continually remade. East Asian immigrants in New York City have developed a diverse and dynamic system to satisfy the demands of their ethnic groups. Although the Asian food system is rapidly undergoing geographic expansion, it displays characteristics apart from other global food systems. Trade networks based in social relations, diverse cropping systems, and family owned and operated firms constitute the Asian food system. The seemingly unique nature of this food system leads to the main research questions, how is the distribution and production of Asian fruits and vegetables organized? Is it different than corporately controlled, globalized agriculture? Does it have different social and environmental impacts? Tying together previous studies on the globalization of agriculture, alternative food systems and studies on agrobiodiversity, this project will describe and analyze the cultivation and marketing of Asian fruits and vegetables on a newly emergent global scale. The project will be multi-sited and include New York City as the market destination, southern Florida as a well-established point of production and distribution, and Honduras as a newly emergent site of production. This project will combine standard ecological surveys and spatial analysis with semi-structured interviews to examine how the relationship between consumers, distributors and producers ultimately influence the use of plant resources in a food system. <br/><br/>By focusing on a food system broadly distinguished by ethnicity, this research will describe how immigrants not only create new market demands, but concurrently create new systems of resource use to satisfy their demands. This understanding is significant in a world of highly mobile people and commodities. This project will build on the tradition of research within geography that looks at the influence of political and economic structures on natural resource use, while taking a new approach that integrates this tradition with research on global agricultural systems. Research results will include impact analysis of a poorly-studied system of production and distribution and will generate suggestions for market-based agricultural development and trade regulation. High school students in New York City are included in the project as interns, providing them with scientific training. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

It examines these issues in a comparative perspective, specifically in New York City (a historic immigrant destination) and Madrid (a recent immigrant destination). The principal research questions are: What boundaries do children of immigrants see as the dominant dividing lines between social groups in their country of residence, and how flexible are these boundaries? To what degree do children of immigrants feel receiving society national membership is available to them, and what role, if any, does immigrant-descent or ethno-racial minority status play in limiting membership? Research methods are both comparative and qualitative; analysis is principally based upon in-depth interviews with members of the Latin American 1.5 and second generation in each location.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to an improved understanding of the current and possible future courses of diversity in receiving societies. For instance, the comparative framework and focus on perceived boundaries contributes to research on the contextual basis of social boundaries, and this has direct implications for research on racial and ethnic integration. Existing comparative transatlantic research often focuses on measures of integration and immigrant success, such as educational and economic outcomes. Yet perceived opportunities of belonging - the focus of this study - both reflect and affect these outcome measures. Moreover, since dominant assimilation theories were developed with an eye towards the U.S., their assumptions about the placement and salience of social boundaries (e.g., the perceived permissibility of diversity, and the presence of established minorities) may not accurately reflect other settings. It therefore broadens assimilation theory to consider boundaries and membership possibilities in other socio-historical contexts. <br/><br/>Most research on migrants in Europe focuses on Muslim populations, but this study focuses on a non-Muslim group. This study adds to the body of literature on migrant-descent populations in Europe, and it highlights the role of race and ethnicity, rather than religion, as potential social divides. The focus on Latin Americans in Europe also contributes to the study of Latin American migration, which has been overwhelmingly focused on immigration to the United States. Finally, despite Spain?s relative prominence as a receiving country within Europe, most research on Europe has focused on Northern and Western Europe. This study?s focus on Spain will therefore contribute to the regional diversity of immigration research and improve understanding of a key immigrant receiving area."

Since the early 1980's Greek agriculture has become increasingly dependent on immigrant labor. At the same time women, who were traditionally an important source of labor in the subsistence economies of Greek villages, have been increasingly incorporated into the formal economy. Both these developments reflect the growing integration of Greece into transnational and global networks of exchange, particularly since its entry into the European Union, and have often been represented as the modernization and democratization of the Greek countryside. However, these developments also represent a fundamental transformation in the reproduction of social inequality from an older discursive framework centered on gender and kinship to a newer discourse centered on ethnicity and citizenship. This research project will examine shifting discourses of inequality in a rural Greek community as it has changed from a dependence on gendered, kin-organized labor to immigrant labor. Using methods of participant-observation and discourse analysis, the student will map out the relationship between the construction of gender and national ideologies and the mobilization of agricultural labor. The student will collect data both on how people think about inequality and on how social stratification is organized in order to uncover the processes by which social inequality is being reproduced at the local level. The project will advance our understanding of contemporary processes of globalization and their implications for local social organization. It will also advance our understanding of the roles of gender and ethnicity in Mediterranean social organization."

The overall theoretical approach is that of cultural ecology. The empirical research involves both ethnographic and physical-process methodologies: participant observation of farmers' perceptions of erosion and their actual erosion-control practices; formal interviews with selected farmers; field measurements of erosion over the year-long field study; and analysis of collected soil samples using measurements of radiation emitted by atmospheric-fallout Cesium-137, in an attempt to determine eroded versus non-eroded and depositional horizons within the soil samples. The results of the research should increase our understanding of traditional and changing farming systems in a highland setting, and contribute to a greater awareness, among development specialists and international aid institutions, of the need to examine local needs and priorities before initiating particular conservation programs."

This project addresses three main questions about social inequality through a mixed methodology design that includes documental, survey and interview data. First, this research examines how public policy debates framed the change in this economic sector in relation to issues of gender equality and shifts in immigration across the EU and in Spain. Second, the study investigates the relationship between employing paid domestic workers and the gender division of paid and unpaid work within households. Finally, the project analyzes the societal-level implications of increases in paid domestic work for changes in inequality between families over time. This research seeks to make a theoretical and empirical contribution by connecting the dynamics of pay domestic work sector to changes in the effects of gender, ethnicity and class on stratification and the meaning of social inequality in the EU.<br/><br/>Broader impacts <br/><br/>The escalation of paid domestic work is taking place in different places around the world under similar circumstances. This study provides a framework to understand the implications of this economic sector for the broader structure of inequality, which could be used to contrast with other countries. Current policy debates, especially at the European Union level, legitimate the growth of this economic sector and propose to professionalize and formalize it. This research aims to inform this debate by providing more information about the actual implications of such proposals and making visible some of the ways in which inequalities based on gender, class and ethnicized citizenship may not only be reinforced but also possibly enhanced. This analysis is also crucial to understand the meanings and implications of current policy debates about fertility, migration and women's employment broadly understood. The results may be of interest to policy makers, domestic workers rights' advocates, feminist organizations and other organizations working on related social justice areas."

The consortium under examination includes scientists who have formed an alliance, which is transdisciplinary, transnational, and is comprised of public and private academic, clinical, nongovernmental, biotechnological, and state funded institutions. This investigation is anchored with a subset cluster within The Consortium comprised of scientists from University of Chicago in collaboration with University of Washington, University of Texas Health Sciences, and Decode Genetics, Inc, an Icelandic biotechnology firm. As an ex-officio member of The Consortium, and by following DNA data sets through the pathways of collaborative research back to their points of origin, the researcher will investigate how DNA taken from racially marked populations is transformed into a genetic understanding of Type 2 Diabetes. The genetics of diabetes is a rich area by which to investigate the use and definition of race in biomedical research because its risk factors are said to include diet, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and membership in various racial and/or ethnic groups. The use of DNA from racially identified populations presents a challenge for medical research, however, because the genetic markers and their contributions vary between and within populations. Further, the environmental risk factors for these diseases make the isolation of genetic causes problematic. Still, the parsing of populations by race is the first stage in the genetic epidemiology of diabetes. While the historical record of the advancement of biological differences of race demonstrates brutal consequence, a summary indictment of biological race often overlooks the ways biological and social knowledge is produced. Harrison (1995) points out that the critique of the biological concept of race led to a ""no race"" position in favor of ethnicity. However, this does not explain why racial social categories persist in many situations. Drawing upon the social studies of technoscience and medicine as well as critical theories of race, this project consists of interviews and sustained observation of scientists in their places of work, at scientific meetings and of their collective conversations about the power of data sets and experimental results. The heterogeneously positioned researchers in this collaborative venture requires the standardization of race (biological and social) in order to compare results, combine data sets and make generalizable scientific claims. Thus, this project investigates the strategic production of disease-gene carrier-populations, (the stated beneficiaries of the collaborative enterprise), and goes beyond the simple binarisms of biological versus social race. Finally, this examination of the epidemiology (genetic and social/ environmental) of Type 2 Diabetes evaluates the emerging significance of genetic science for the prevention and cure of complex diseases and assesses the consequences of the collaborative practices of biomedical genetic science."

The site of Pampa Grande is four square kilometers of dense urban settlement and was home to tens of thousands of inhabitants at its height during the Late Moche Period (AD 600-800). Pampa Grande is most well known for its large civic-ceremonial center which includes the Huaca Fortaleza, a towering mud-brick pyramid used for rituals and administration by the site's ruling elites. Investigations for this project will be carried out in the domestic sector of the Southern Pediment of the site, believed to have housed the lower class majority. This research will assess the development of urbanism and the associated changes in social organization that occurred as people from the surrounding valley aggregated and amalgamated into a rapidly colonized center. <br/><br/>Urban research has shown that the family is no longer autonomous in the context of the city. New forms of social organization based on socio-economic status, occupation, and ethnicity develop as unrelated people come together and form new social communities. An earlier survey by Ilana Johnson has revealed three markedly different residential areas in the Southern Pediment. Perhaps most interesting is the presence of apartment-like compounds suggesting new types of social organization beyond the household level. These three domestic areas will be sampled and compared through area excavations in order to test hypotheses regarding the social changes that occur with the development of urbanism. Excavations will be carried out within several rooms inside the apartment compounds in order to understand the layout of individual domiciles, as well as the compound as a whole. Three hypotheses will be explored in detail. First, research will explore if neighborhoods were organized by occupation or socio-economic status. Second, excavations within apartment compounds will examine if the household remained autonomous in the context of urbanism. And finally, domestic artifacts will be analyzed to determine if foreign objects represent ethnic differences or merchant ties. The resulting data will shed light onto the types of communities developed among the lower class inhabitants of Pampa Grande in prehistory. <br/><br/>The proposed research will make contributions to the local community of Pampa Grande, to the understanding of Moche prehistory, as well as to broader anthropological theory. Public outreach will be conducted in the form of lectures, classroom visits, and donations of time and money to the local site museum. The intellectual merit of this project will be to provide data on rapid urbanism in state societies. The data recovered during investigations will shed light onto the social affiliations and stratifications that developed in response to the new physical, social, and cultural surroundings of a densely urbanized city. The broader impact is an anthropological understanding of such behavior from around the world. These data will be valuable for cross-cultural comparisons with primary urban centers in other geographic areas. As the population of the globe approaches ten billion in the next two generations, such research will be invaluable for defining strategies and adaptations employed by people in a number of different cultural contexts."

Although there is now a body of literature on the formal laws and court decisions affecting education, there has been almost no sociological research on how law affects the daily lives of students, teachers, and school administrators. In particular, we do not know whether or how laws designed to ensure equality of education for our nation's youth benefit socially disadvantaged students who rely most heavily on schools for access to life-course opportunities. The study focuses on three arenas of legal regulation that are central to schools -- discipline, civil rights (including sexual, racial/ethnic, and religious harassment), and free speech -- to examine: (1) how law matters in the everyday practices within and around schools; (2) how school actors (students, teachers, and administrators) understand and interpret law and rights in schools; and (3) when and how school actors mobilize (or do not mobilize) their legal rights. Surveys of students, teachers, and administrators are being completed in multiple schools across three different states that have varying legal environments: California, New York, and North Carolina. Comparative ethnographies will be completed in six of these schools (two in each state) that differ substantially in terms of the social backgrounds (i.e., household income and ethnicity) of the students enrolled. Ethnographic data collection (including direct observation and in-depth interviews) focuses on how law and other forms of authority are experienced by students, teachers, and administrators in schools. <br/><br/>This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the role of law and rights in schools. It will significantly extend current work, which focuses on the formal law and court decisions, by providing a sociological analysis of how law and rights affect the everyday lives and opportunities of students, teachers, and administrators. It further explores the extent to which the implementation and impact of law varies across schools that serve socially advantaged and socially disadvantaged youth. This work will contribute substantially to work on rights and mobilization in the sociology of law, to work on inequality and educational opportunity in the sociology of education, to work on the interplay between organizations and their socio-legal environments in organizational sociology, and to the development of a nexus linking these bodies of social science research."

Many police departments have begun to voluntarily collect such data. In this project we want to examine the issue of racial disparities in policing using the modern methods of economic analysis, both theoretical and empirical, as well as develop new methods.<br/><br/>Questions Addressed: A common pattern in these police datasets is that blacks and Hispanics tend to be overrepresented in police stops and searches, which raises a number of questions. First, do these disparities reflect police bias? Second, if they do not, should they be permitted---and, if so, under what circumstances? Are these disparities the inevitable byproduct of goal-oriented enforcement by an unbiased police? Third, what is the current state of the law, and what should be the legal approach to the use of race or ethnicity in policing?<br/><br/>The PIs propose to apply the rational choice approach to study the use of race in policing. The research program proceeds in three steps.<br/><br/>Year 1: Empirical Analysis of Existing Data Sets Analyze a number of existing data sets, using existing models and methods, some of which have been developed by the PIs. Also attempt to gather new data sets.<br/><br/>Year 2: Creation of New and Improved Theoretical Models. New theoretical models are needed to deal with hitherto ignored features of the data, such as the disparity in stops (as opposed to searches). The PIs will build on prior work in developing new models and use them derive new empirical tests for racial bias in policing. The tests will be implemented using the datasets from Year 1.<br/><br/>Year 3: Advancing the Legal Scholarship on Racial Profiling Litigation. Based on the results of the research in Years 1 and 2, the PIs will analyze whether the current legal framework allows successful prosecution of impermissible racial disparities, and offer possible improvements.<br/><br/>Broader Social Goals: The ultimate goals of the proposal are to improve our theoretical and empirical understanding of the phenomenon of racial disparities in policing, and then to apply the knowledge gained to suggest improvements to the current legal approach to racial profiling litigation."

In recent years, sociolegal scholars have begun to investigate how cultural variation in preferences for dispute resolution procedures is related to individual psychological processes. This study will extend this work by examining how procedural preferences are shaped by a person's culture of origin, acculturation to new social forms, gender, social status, and economic resources. This comparative study conducted in the United States, Germany, and Hong Kong systematically analyzes patterns of procedural preferences, attitudes toward various forms of regulation, and dispute-related beliefs and behaviors. These three sites have been the target of substantial migration. Two experimental studies will be conducted, involving approximately 500 participants at each site, to test whether differences in preferences for types of dispute resolution reflect differences in values or differences in beliefs about the effective or appropriate means to reach their goals. One study will focus on preferences about options available for dealing with disputes (such as ignoring the conflict, ignoring the disputant, or direct negotiation). The second will consider the means available to resolve the conflict (such as mediation or adversarial adjudication). The project will contribute to our understanding of transnational issues by advancing our knowledge of how culture, ethnicity, recency of migration, and other social factors interact to shape individuals' legal attitudes and reactions to a variety of laws, disputing fora, and disputing options. From a global perspective, the results will have major significance for increasing our knowledge of what drives preferences for one form of law or regulatory regime over another and of why people of diverse cultural origins differ in their views about what constitutes a fair procedure or law."

By examining if, how, and why, in the face of child welfare policies premised on legal or biological definitions of `family,` women create and maintain a sense of themselves as `mothers` rather than `foster mothers` and `children` rather than `foster children,` the project will clarify the circumstances that lead to foster parent disillusionment, fatigue and, finally, drop-out.

Voters must select a representative to make those choices for them. This paper starts with the premise that voters are instrumentally rational; they select the candidate who, if elected, is most likely to accomplish the goals they prefer. Thus they must predict what each candidate would choose to do in office and how well they would do it. However, the public has only imperfect knowledge of their representative's preferences and actions, as well as uncertainty about the types of issues and circumstances that are likely to arise in the future. Thus, to predict how candidates will behave in office, given different possible future challenges or issues environments, voters rely on different estimators, such as the candidate's political platforms, prior performance, as well as personal background, experiences, and group loyalties or identity. These measures offer varying degrees of accuracy in estimating candidates' likely performance in office, if elected, depending upon the information available for each of the metrics. Less information makes a metric less efficient; hence less accuracy. In addition, voters may change their preferences for the type of representative, based on political circumstances. This change depends upon the likely issue agenda, in which voters may vary their preferences as the expected political economic environment changes. I test this theory experimentally in an internet survey using a random selection of students. Each student will participate in a series of mock elections to see how they alter their vote as the candidate combinations are systematically changed (candidates' platforms, ethnicity, and reported competence). Furthermore, different elections include an additional altered element, such as varying the issue environment and the issue content of the candidates' platforms. Thus, since voters are concerned with outcomes, they are expected to change their vote depending upon the context, even for the same set of candidates. Some of the implications of this decision process investigated in this paper include: Do voters rely on the same basic framework for decisionmaking in which they evaluate each candidate across several dimensions, considering dimension uncertainty and salience? When are voters more likely to cast aside an ineffective incumbent? What factors condition political accountability, making it less likely that voters do not reject the poorly performing incumbent? Are voters acting in choosing a candidate from the same ethnic or racial background as themselves? Why are issues in campaigns often vague and symbolic? Does a politician adding new, popular issues to his platform during a campaign increase the votes proportionally to how strongly people feel about an issue? Does a candidate receive a policy mandate from an election victory?"

These economically disadvantaged women have a high risk for exposure to HIV, and this research seeks to identify network and belief structures that may be protective in reducing risks. Most of the data collection will occur in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, a destination for large numbers of migrant workers. Structured interviews will be conducted with women of two ethnic groups to establish demographic characteristics (age, education, occupation, migration history, marital status, and other facts), and those will be used to select probability samples corresponding to the migrant populations. Further interviews with women selected in the sampling will inquire about sexual partners and practices, friendship and family ties, and religious beliefs. Data analyses will focus on potentially protective effects of social networks and religious beliefs in reducing the incidence of unprotected sexual activity, the frequency of sexual activity, and the number of partners. Regressions, using density of social networks and homophily in ethnicity, village of origin, and religion as independent variables, permit assessment of hypotheses regarding social structures and sexual practices. Networks are expected to directly affect sexual practices, while effects of religion are expected to be indirect, operating through networks. Results of this research include developing network models, establishing a network data set, and improved understanding of how social networks interact with what might appear to be highly individual decisions regarding sexual practices."

Although there is now a body of literature on the formal laws and court decisions affecting education, there has been almost no sociological research on how law affects the daily lives of students, teachers, and school administrators. In particular, we do not know whether or how laws designed to ensure equality of education for our nation's youth benefit socially disadvantaged students who rely most heavily on schools for access to life-course opportunities. The study focuses on three arenas of legal regulation that are central to schools -- discipline, civil rights (including sexual, racial/ethnic, and religious harassment), and free speech -- to examine: (1) how law matters in the everyday practices within and around schools; (2) how school actors (students, teachers, and administrators) understand and interpret law and rights in schools; and (3) when and how school actors mobilize (or do not mobilize) their legal rights. Surveys of students, teachers, and administrators are being completed in multiple schools across three different states that have varying legal environments: California, New York, and North Carolina. Comparative ethnographies will be completed in six of these schools (two in each state) that differ substantially in terms of the social backgrounds (i.e., household income and ethnicity) of the students enrolled. Ethnographic data collection (including direct observation and in-depth interviews) focuses on how law and other forms of authority are experienced by students, teachers, and administrators in schools. <br/><br/>This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the role of law and rights in schools. It will significantly extend current work, which focuses on the formal law and court decisions, by providing a sociological analysis of how law and rights affect the everyday lives and opportunities of students, teachers, and administrators. It further explores the extent to which the implementation and impact of law varies across schools that serve socially advantaged and socially disadvantaged youth. This work will contribute substantially to work on rights and mobilization in the sociology of law, to work on inequality and educational opportunity in the sociology of education, to work on the interplay between organizations and their socio-legal environments in organizational sociology, and to the development of a nexus linking these bodies of social science research."

The influence of family dynamics on Asian American academic achievement has been well-documented. However, the role of gender has largely been overlooked. Compared to their male counterparts, Asian American women are less likely to participate in higher education and to major in math, science and engineering. Yet, when compared to women of other racial and ethnic groups, they are more likely to choose quantitative fields of study. This research seeks to provide a point of departure for shedding light on the processes that create this phenomenon through an examination of family, peers and school. Chinese Americans will be studied because there is a gender gap in educational access, and the population is stratified by economic class, date of entry into the United States, place of origin and nativity status. This research will focus on second-generation Chinese American undergraduates, and will address several questions: (1) To what extent do immigrant parents influence their children's choice of academic major and career plans, and are there gender differences in this influence? (2) How do family background and environment, particularly in relation to migration, affect women and men's educational experiences? (3) To what extent are women's choices related to their interaction with faculty and peers, and social pressures outside the family? This project will explore these questions through in-depth interviews with men and women attending two New York City colleges and their families, as well as through participant observation conducted at school and in the home."

The results are likely to be valuable to a large portion of the engineering education community given that AWISE data will be collected at a large engineering school with a diverse student population. AWISE will determine through valid research the impact of ABET 2000 criteria on the use of teams, which are assumed to be beneficial to underrepresented students.

This study examines how the male-gendered construction of STEM creates environments that put women at risk for social identity threat, which harms their performance, motivation, and identification with STEM fields. For men, the masculinization of STEM leads to social identity privilege, which can improve their outcomes. <br/><br/>This research tests three hypotheses. The amplification hypothesis proposes that the impact of social identity threat will be greater in more masculinized STEM fields relative to less masculinized STEM fields. This is tested through a manipulation of social identity threat by exposing participants to an allegedly sexist instructor (Study 1), a sexist joke (Study 2), or body objectifying photos (Study 3). The cultural grounding hypothesis proposes that the masculinization of STEM and the resultant gender gap varies across cultural contexts. This hypothesis is tested by examining the magnitude of the amplification effects across universities (Studies 1 ? 3). The consciousness-raising hypothesis proposes that increased consciousness of sexism as a source of the STEM gender gap protects women's outcomes in STEM fields. Studies 1 ? 3 test this hypothesis by examining whether individual differences in critical consciousness are a source of resilience for women exposed to social identity threatening cues in a STEM domain. Study 4 tests this hypothesis by examining whether a consciousness-raising intervention has long term impacts on academic outcomes among women majoring in STEM. STEM majors at the University of Kansas, Tulane University, and Xavier University are participating in this research.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This research promotes teaching, training, and learning at the PIs? institutions through the creation of research teams of undergraduate and graduate research assistants. Students will have the opportunity to assist in data collection, data analysis, and will be given opportunities to serve as co-authors on conference presentations and publications when appropriate. The project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in science by including Xavier students as both research participants and as members of the research team. Providing opportunities for Xavier students to work as research assistants contributes to the development of ethnic minority scientists. The results of this research will be communicated to STEM majors at the participating institutions, STEM educators, and the scientific community. The research has the potential to benefit society more broadly by identifying factors that make women vulnerable and resilient in STEM contexts. The approach will integrate research and education by using the results of the research to develop an educational intervention to increase women?s performance and participation in STEM fields. The research findings and integrative approach ultimately contribute to more effective scientific institutions."

The project is to monitor and compare the economic, political and demographic transformations occurring in two highland Chiapas, Mexico indigenous communities whose changes have been charted in separate projects for almost 30 years. This area has seen an armed rebellion by Zapatista rebels in 1994, and is the focus of high interest by the national Mexican government as well as foreign observers. The communities to be studied exemplify broader dynamics affecting indigenous society throughout this region and in other similar regions in Latin America. One community in Zinacantan has been the local indigenous elite for over 500 years, and has differentiated around capitalized farming and small business enterprises; the other in Chamula has been land-poor for many years and has relied traditionally on agrarian wage work. In both communities economic changes have recently factionalized local politics, in one case identifying with national political parties, in the other with national (and international) religious proselytizing sects. Both communities are experiencing new flows along what were traditionally fixed ethnic boundaries. Using methods of ethnographic participant-observation coupled with household-level censuses of local communities that have been recorded since the early 1960s in one case and the early 1970s in another case, the investigators will update demographic, political, social, economic and cultural information on families and individuals. These censuses will be coordinated, computerized, and placed into relational databases, which will be linked with a local research institution ECOSUR, compiling health-related socio-economic data for use by regional planners. The strength of this data set will be the relatively long time span, the rich ethnographically-described cultural context, and the clear focus on individuals and households instead of on communities. This project is important because the data to be gathered will be used by analysts to explain differential activities in job creation, social and political organization, and religious conversions in this region which is undergoing dynamic rapid and explosive change. It will be an immensely valuable resource for social scientists trying to explain the course of events as well as planners trying to modify these trends."

The bulk of these data, however, remains inaccessible to researchers. This project creates an integrated global database of over 150 censuses from at least 44 countries. The International Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS-International) will be the world's largest public-use population database, with multiple samples from each country enabling analyses across time and space. These microdata and accompanying documentation will be freely available for scholarly and educational research through a web-based data dissemination system. The project leverages NSF investment in a major social science infrastructure project now nearing completion, ""International Integrated Microdata Access System"" (SBR9908380). That project covered many of the costs of finding and preserving microdata and documentation, negotiating dissemination agreements, developing data cleaning and sampling procedures, creating data conversion and dissemination software, and establishing design protocols for data and documentation. As a result, creation of the new database will be highly cost effective.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit. Census microdata represent an extraordinary untapped resource for research and education in human and social dynamics. With over five hundred million records spanning four decades, the new database will offer far broader chronological scope and greater sample densities than any alternative data source. For most countries, censuses are the most representative source of population data available. The new database will allow investigators to analyze global change during a period of unprecedented economic, demographic, and political upheaval. The research team is uniquely qualified to undertake this massive database project. The investigators represent a diverse range of fields, including demography, economics, epidemiology, history, regional planning, and sociology. They have an unparalleled record of accomplishment on large-scale census infrastructure projects and wide-ranging international microdata experience. The Minnesota Population Center will house the project, providing exceptional facilities and technical support.<br/><br/>Broader Impact. This project will reduce barriers to international research and education by preserving datasets and making them freely available, converting them into a uniform format, providing comprehensive documentation, and implementing web-based tools for disseminating the microdata and documentation. The database will provide fundamental infrastructure for a broad range of fields in the social and behavioral sciences, including economics, geography, sociology, population studies, and environmental studies. Researchers in most countries do not presently have access even to their own national census microdata; IPUMS-International will democratize access to this vital scientific resource, creating unprecedented opportunities for global-scale research.<br/><br/>Most census data have traditionally been available only in aggregated tabular form. Census microdata provide information about individual persons, families, and households, and they allow users to interrelate any desired set of population and housing characteristics. The flexibility offered by microdata is essential for comparative research on social dynamics because the aggregate tabulations produced by national statistical offices are usually not comparable across time or between countries. In the few countries where census microdata covering multiple census years have been easily available to researchers, these data are the most widely used source for the study of large-scale economic and demographic transformations. Making integrated census microdata available for almost half of the world's population will allow researchers to describe the transformation of the world in far richer detail than previously possible. Even more important, these data will provide unprecedented opportunities to investigate the agents of change and assess their implications for human society. Census microdata are an essential resource for studying large-scale transformational changes such as economic development, urbanization, fertility transition, large-scale migration, population aging, mass education, democratization, and growing international trade and capital flows. The availability of multiple censuses for each country lends historical depth, revealing the trajectories of change hidden in snapshots from the recent past. These data allow detailed study of the relationships of social and economic change to variations in climate, geography, and environment. They are also uniquely suited to assessing the human consequences of social, economic, and demographic transformations in such diverse areas as family structure, economic inequality, cultural diversity, and assimilation."

As is common across the country, OU as a whole, and the College of Engineering (COE) in particular, have achieved differential levels of success in graduating students from these populations. This project will study these patterns, focusing on the questions (1) What systemic factors contribute to the success of URM students in engineering at large, predominantly white universities? and (2) What systemic factors contribute to differential success between URM populations? An external advisory board will inform the collection and analysis of data, as well as the interpretation and dissemination of results.<br/>Intellectual Merit: Given the context, this research is building on and expanding prior research in very specific ways. First, research and interventions have routinely either focused on only one population or addressed URMs as a unit without taking into account differential needs and perspectives among the populations. Second, much of the scholarship related to URM participation in STEM fields has focused on factors related to loss from the pipeline. However, although engineering graduation rates are not as high as desired, OU has achieved atypical levels of success with URM populations. Thus, this group is in an unusual position both to disaggregate similarities and differences among populations and to identify factors related to success as well as those systemic factors that need improvement. A student's opportunities, options, and choices are affected by a complex web of factors. We have sorted our target factors into the following overlapping categories: (1) race/ethnicity; (2) attributes of engineering as a field; (3) student's background; (4) attributes of academic communities; (5) attributes of personal support structures and responsibilities; (6) attributes of student communities; and (7) student's future. In addition to examining patterns in quantitative data, qualitative data will be longitudinal and open-ended from interviews with students, faculty, advisors, and program directors, as well as observations of student group activities and student communities. These open-ended data allow investigation of the student experience in a holistic way, guided by factor categories distilled from the literature and the expertise of the research team. This team has experience with this model from work related to a grant from the NSF Research on Gender in Science and Engineering program.<br/>Broader Impacts: This proposal is submitted through the OU-based K20+ Center for Educational and Community Renewal. The team is multidisciplinary (e.g., engineering, education, STEM education research, and African and African-American studies) and systemic (e.g., personnel include the Director of Engineering Education ). The research is contributing to the knowledge about increasing URM persistence in STEM undergraduate majors and will inform intervention efforts and future research directions. We will disseminate to faculty, administrators, policy makers, and parents by way of sessions and workshops at conferences, journal articles, campus-wide teaching seminars and other instructional development initiatives, the K20+ Center network, and appropriate websites."

By increasing our knowledge about the cultural resources people reference about science, this project may help craft media that can directly teach, be used as examples to promote critical thinking in the general public, promote more favorable images of scientists, or debunk psychics and other ersatz practitioners who regularly appear in media outlets. There also has been a resurgence of public interest in under represented groups, e.g., women, African-Americans and Hispanics in specific science and technology occupations. The images of scientists that adults transmit to youth help create a climate affecting the appeal of science careers. By counteracting stereotyped views of obsessive and peculiar scientists, we may increase the number and diversity of gifted individuals who find science careers more attractive."

Chaco Canyon, now a National Historic Park in northwestern New Mexico, is home to several 11th and 12th century ""Great Houses,"" impressive masonry buildings of unparalleled size and importance. Those who resided in Chaco Canyon came to control or influence settlements located throughout the Four Corners area, one of the largest prehistoric social developments in what is now the United States. Great Houses regularly inspire and fascinate adventurous visitors to the park, prompting them to ask the following: ""Why did they build these tremendous buildings? Why here? How could such a fantastic civilization develop in this harsh desert? And how did it work?"" Archaeologists have been asking these same questions for about a century and Duff's research project is designed to help provide answers. However, he will do so not by working in Chaco Canyon itself, but by looking at archaeological sites located some 120 miles south of Chaco Canyon that were part of the ""Chaco Phenomenon.""<br/><br/>Although Chaco Canyon has a long history of research, archaeologists still have relatively few case studies from outlying Great Houses and their associated communities despite the fact that the rationale for Chaco Canyon having been the center of a ""regional system"" implies links between the canyon and these distant communities. Duff and his research team will investigate a group of Great House communities on the southern frontier of Chaco's reach, providing data used to build a sound understanding of settlement chronology, community size, environmental conditions, and community interactions. The research includes: archaeological survey around, and systematic excavations at two Great Houses and their associated communities; a program of visitation and mapping of all reported Great Houses in the project region; investigation of Great House function through analysis of artifacts and botanical remains; and examination of local, regional, and inter-regional trade of ceramics and obsidian used to monitor exchange relationships. <br/><br/>This innovative and interdisciplinary research will not only provide new data relevant to understanding the Chacoan system, but also serve to promote appreciation for the precontact history of Native Americans because Chaco Canyon serves as a case study in North American archaeology courses, in textbooks, in the popular press and videos. Chacoan research regularly receives regional and national media coverage. Project results will be disseminated through class instruction, publication, and outreach, and they have the potential to reach the broader public via popular press and visitation to Chaco Canyon National Historical Park. Several undergraduate and graduate students will receive hands-on training and mentoring while being directly involved with project field work and post-field analyses. Broadly conceived this work will reach the interested public while helping to promote an appreciation for archaeological resources, their preservation, and for the Native Americans who created them."

For example, citizens may seek to dismiss (or vote against) an official who abuses his power, but will they be as willing to do so after hearing the justifications that politicians often make? Will their response be different if they share a political identity with the authority - party membership, race, or ethnicity? Which has the greatest impact? This study investigates the effect of an authority's political identity, performance, and persuasion on public accountability in South Africa. There is evidence that each of these factors affects how citizens view politicians and thus their willingness to hold them accountable. This study will extend that research by using a novel experimental design that can test not only how each factor operates individually, but also how they interact. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the study is connected to its design: assignment of participants to different ""treatment"" groups is random. Because assignment to the specific identity, performance, and persuasion of the authority is random, differences in how participants respond can be confidently attributed to the treatment. Participants will be recruited from public spaces near Johannesburg, South Africa. South Africa was chosen because the research questions are especially important for new democracies. In particular, the ruling African National Congress (ANC), which liberated South Africa from apartheid, has come under increasing scrutiny for abuses of power. And yet to date the ANC appears to have paid only a limited political price - in May 2014 the party won national elections with more than 60% of the vote for the fifth consecutive time since 1994. This study examines why this is the case. It may be because abuses are unimportant to voters relative to other ANC achievements. It may be because voters identify so strongly with the party that they are willing to condone abuses. Or, it may be because the ANC is still able to appeal to values of freedom and equality that they demonstrated in the liberation struggle. <br/><br/>The broader impacts are associated with the implications for development, democracy, and policy. The ANC delivered democracy to South Africa, but its dominance makes it hard for checks and balances to operate. This puts an added burden on the public to hold officials to account. The study provides insights into the conditions under which they are likely to bear that burden well. It also contributes to a broader theory and planned research agenda about the role of public accountability in institutional development of any democracy: the research is replicable in different national and cultural contexts. With a theory of public accountability built on sound micro-foundations, better strategies can be developed to strengthen it."

Specifically, the goals are to: 1) investigate the definition of leadership as defined by engineering students, faculty, and industry; 2) develop a theoretical model of leadership development as perceived by undergraduate engineering students and faculty; 3) develop a survey instrument to measure leadership capacity and efficacy in engineering; and 4) collect and analyze data with an eye toward evaluating differences between or among major, gender, socio-economic status, generational status, and ethnicity. The impact of this project is the enabling of measurement of leadership competencies among engineers on a continuum from first year undergraduate students through graduation and into their careers as practicing engineers. The results of this project can be used to inform evidence-based curricular and co-curricular activities, policies and practices in engineering programs to improve the nation's capacity to prepare students in STEM careers.<br/><br/>The project uses a multilevel, multiphase, multi-institutional, mixed methodology to: 1) generate a clear definition of engineering leadership from the perspectives of undergraduate students and faculty in engineering, ABET, and National Academy Engineering, and the construction industry; 2) develop a theoretical model describing leadership development among undergraduate engineering students; and 3) produce and pilot test an instrument to measure leadership competency (i.e., efficacy, capacity, and mastery) across a continuum from undergraduate engineering students to practicing professionals. The research plan is grounded in theories from engineering education and leadership studies and builds on the project team's previous work in producing a meta-synthesis of leadership in engineering. To address the interconnected outcomes, this project uses the following methods: three-round Delphi Study, Q-Sort, deductive analysis, a seven-step survey development protocol and grounded theory methods."

Specifically, the project will investigate the issues of (a) current knowledge and change over time on specific mathematics skills, (b) the extent to which the performance is related to specific mathematics curricula, and (c) the connection between courses taken in high school and mathematics performance. Whenever possible, results will be disaggregated by demographic variables, including SES and race/ethnicity variables available in the NAEP data set. Results of the study will point to aspects of the curriculum that impact performance and will identify mathematics concept and skill clusters where student knowledge is underdeveloped. <br/><br/>Both the Main and LTT mathematics assessments are representative of the nation as a whole. They contain items aligned with frameworks established by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) with consideration not only to mathematics-specific content but also to the cognitive processes involved in arriving at a solution. By partnering with researchers who are familiar with the secure items used on NAEP, analyses conducted will allow for description of skills measured by NAEP that portray the mathematics skills of U.S. students across a variety of topics. One of the unique aspects of this project is that data from the Main and LTT NAEPs will be pooled to provide richer data that encompass a body of key mathematics concepts and skills. The item equating process will begin with content analyses to match Main and LTT items that involve the same cognitive processes and solution algorithms. The research team anticipates that content analyses will result in multiple item clusters at each age level. The project will take a bi-directional focus, at times focusing on students' current knowledge while at other times focusing on how the mathematics knowledge of students today compares to knowledge of students 15 to 30 years ago. An external advisory board will provide input on the analyses and an external evaluation team will evaluate the project. <br/><br/>The primary indicator for success of the project will be the extent to which the research products benefit school personnel, curriculum developers, and other researchers. Building upon the last two edited volumes on NAEP mathematics results published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, project researchers will produce articles and a book that go beyond existing baseline data on student knowledge on major topics in the mathematics curriculum. Results will provide a stronger statistical basis for making claims about change in student knowledge over time and a broader picture of accomplishment at the level of individual items. This may provide important implications for curriculum and teacher development."

Equally important is the development of highly ethical and professional standards within this group of innovative practitioners. The School of Engineering at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) has formulated a well-balanced liberal arts core integrated with a solid and robust engineering curricular sequence that promises to: (1) improve the retention of engineering students, (2) instill highly ethical and professional standards throughout the four years of the engineering curriculum, and (3) for alumni: a) inspire and strongly encourage them to enhance their engineering knowledge and skills, and b) strive for setting challenging professional goals and achieving them in a timely manner. The architects of this curriculum model have joined forces with faculty from the Department of Sociology to construct the necessary surveying tools and procedures for a comprehensive examination of the degree of effectiveness and the timing of the different interventions and reinforcements built into this promising model. The findings from these evaluations would enable this multi-disciplinary research team to develop a much deeper understanding for further calibration of this curriculum for optimal results. The techniques, surveying tools, and procedures used for conducting this two-year study, along with a summary of the results, will be made available at the national level for potential adoption, examination of similar models, and future collaborations.<br/><br/>The School of Engineering at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), in close collaboration with faculty from the Department of Sociology, has initiated a research program that assesses the effectiveness of a liberal arts core program combined with a strong vertical engineering professional sequence on the professional formation of engineering students. In this study, the multi-disciplinary team examines the influence of a number of curricular and extracurricular education interventions such as engineering-specific ethics case studies, lessons on professional licensure, interaction with alumni through a formal mentoring program, liberal arts coursework, solving open-ended design problems, internships, and/or undergraduate research experiences. The project consists of two phases: (1) creation of the instruments based on existing measures and development of new measures using qualitative methods in Year 1, and (2) pilot studies in Year 2 that are designed to validate the created instruments. Formative evaluation during these phases allows for modification of measures and timing, and may influence the delivery interventions, based on early analysis of data collected. Summative evaluation provides the validity of the instruments that can then be applied to larger populations. The objective of this initial study is to create and validate instruments that can be used to assess the effectiveness of this promising model. The instruments may be used in future research programs to evaluate the effectiveness of various factors postulated to influence professional development in engineering students. <br/><br/>An additional area of interest focuses on how professional formation is influenced by demographic factors, and how professional formation is related to persistence and post-graduation success. Results of the planned research program provides insight into the connection between professional formation and individual characteristics that have been demonstrated elsewhere to predict persistence and post-graduation success in populations underrepresented due to gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The assessment instruments developed in this study enable professional formation within these cohorts to be better understood, potentially leading to specific interventions that strengthen professional identity for these special populations. Dissemination of the results to the engineering education community will spread the impact of the results nationally."

Data is being gathered from the school playground, the students' backyards and the larger community surrounding the participating schools. Inter-school information exchange enables the students at each school to relate their situation to the larger picture and the community of schools can collaborate to gain a sense of conditions within the entire watershed. Quantitative examples and activities are being emphasized in order to hone students' mathematics skills, reinforce the existing mathematics curriculum, and demonstrate mathematics' relevance to science and everyday life. Fellows receive a Summer Teacher Training workshop in pedagogy, state and national frameworks, and effective classroom management. Each Fellow is then teamed with a middle school Teacher in a weeklong Summer Environmental Science Content Institute that uses specific examples and hands-on activities within the watershed to strengthen the Teachers' and Fellows' science content knowledge and concept understanding. In addition to their classroom duties, Fellows are required to take a specially developed course, Teaching Environmental Sciences and Technology. (TEST), that provides continuing pedagogical and content training. Five daylong workshops are held for all Fellows and Teachers during the school year to exchange information and experiences and provide additional content and pedagogical material. A 1-credit spring seminar is used as a base to allow one cohort of Fellows to pass on their experiences and knowledge to the next. Special events such as canoe trips, river cleanups, Boston Harbor cruises, and citizen science activities help foster a sense of connectedness across municipal boundaries. WISP will be evaluated internally by a science pedagogy faculty member and externally by the Educational Development Center, Inc. of Newton, MA. The broader benefits of the program accrue to the Fellows, the teachers, the middle school students and the institutions involved. The Fellows are developing the interest, skills, and commitment necessary to be actively engaged in K-12 education throughout their scientific careers. Teachers are gaining environmental science content knowledge and enhancing their ability to teach science curricula and to reflect on their teaching practices. Middle school students are gaining a deeper understanding and appreciation for science and mathematics.

The principal investigators will also investigate the impact of international collaborations on characteristics of academic employment, such as its ability to attract, retain, and/or advance women and minorities in academic jobs. Furthermore, they will investgate how academic culture and climate on international collaborations in various countries compare with each other.<br/>They will also ascertain if collaborating internationally is a key component for the advancement of women and minorities in academia and propose to identify practices that increase women and minority participation in international collaborations. Finally, they will explore how race/ethnicity shape participation in international academic collaborations."

Led by the Miami Science Museum, the collaboration brings together an experienced group of institutions with representation from the informal science, gender research, and engineering communities.<br/><br/>In addition to the Museum, the Expert Project Team consists of key staff from the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC), and SECME Inc. (formerly the Southeastern Consortium of Minorities in Engineering), who serve as the conduit for the participation of minority engineering professional organizations. An advisory/research panel of researchers in gender in STEM, whose work complements those of the project investigators, works closely with the Expert Project Team to prepare Extension Agents from ten geographically dispersed museums, who in turn provide a range of training and peer mentoring services to the practitioner community of informal science educators in science-rich institutions nationwide. Participating museums include: Connecticut Science Center (Hartford, CT), New York Hall of Science (New York, NY), Maryland Science Center (Baltimore, MD), Miami Science Museum (Miami, FL), COSI (Columbus, OH), St. Louis Science Center (St. Louis, MO), Louisville Science Center (Louisville, KY), Sci-Port (Shreveport, LA), Explora (Albuquerque, NM), and California Academy of Sciences (San Francisco, CA).<br/><br/>Specific objectives of the project are to:<br/>- Utilize the national network of science centers and museums to raise awareness and broaden access for girls underrepresented in STEM.<br/>- Develop linkages among organizations with the common purpose of increasing the pipeline of minority female engineers.<br/>- Facilitate the translation of gender and diversity research into practice through a unified training program.<br/>- Provide ongoing services, access to program materials, and tools to broaden the ability of science centers and museum practitioners to provide relevant and engaging programming for girls.<br/><br/>The Girls Rise Network's program of change is tightly focused on increasing the capacity of science centers and museums to interest girls from underrepresented populations in the engineering sciences. It consists of three major processes:<br/>1. Assessing organizational climate with respect to gender, race and ethnicity.<br/>2. Identifying and building community resources related to recruiting, serving and retaining girls in the engineering pipeline.<br/>3. Optimizing the informal science learning environment to engage minority girls in engineering precollege competitions and related programming.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The extension services provided through the Girls RISE Museum Network enable museum practitioners to reach a more diverse population, potentially impacting hundreds of girls; and contribute to broader efforts to reduce barriers to minority girls? participation in STEM activities, courses, and majors. In addition, the informal science educators participating in the project benefit from increased awareness and knowledge of cultural differences, resulting in a network of culturally competent educational leaders within the informal science learning community. The project draws from Expert Project Team resources to provide a central repository of high-quality resources for engaging girls, particularly Hispanic and African American girls, in engineering."

In addition to being the primary showcase for the intellectual achievements of American's undergraduates, this conference provides a unique opportunity to build communities of scholars. In particular, NCUR has a strong commitment to facilitating the networking of minority undergraduate scholars with each other and, to help meet that goal, NCUR has an avowed policy of providing scholarship support for minority students with financial need to attend the annual conference. Aided by continuing funds from the National Science Foundation, scholarships at the last six conferences have risen sharply from 33 to 115 and total attendance by those designating themselves as being of minority ethnicity now approaches 20 percent. The funding requested in this proposal will permit NCUR to continue to actively seek out wide participation of minority students and faculty (in the sciences and engineering) at the annual National Conference. It will permit NCUR to develop workshops and other activities at the annual conferences of special interest to these participants. And, finally, it will allow NCUR to develop a database to assess the effectiveness of undergraduate research participation in influencing the career choices of minority students."

Sixteen percent of the Hispanic doctorate recipients in Science and Mathematics, and twenty percent of the Hispanic doctorate recipients in Engineering during the period 2005-2010 in the United States received their bachelor's degrees from a PR-LSAMP member institution. The economic strength of the United States, its ability to remain competitive in a global economy, and the sense of social health in American society is reliant on the successful incorporation of every ethnicity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. The capability of the nation for innovation and competitiveness depends on its ability to recruit and retain the best talent across racial and socioeconomic groups. The implementation of the UPR BD Activity develops a highly competitive STEM education and research enterprise required to advance Puerto Rico's economic development and meets the national need for diverse STEM professionals. <br/><br/>UPR's BD program will provide multidisciplinary training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines at the Ph.D. level to enable a seamless transition from the STEM baccalaureate degree to STEM graduate studies. Twelve students who received STEM baccalaureate degrees from PR-LSAMP institutions or from mainland LSAMP institutions will be selected and supported as BD Fellows at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus. The program will continue to coordinate its activities with other NSF-funded projects that are managed by the Resource Center for Science and Engineering (RCSE) and by pertinent UPR graduate programs. The activities implemented will increase the number of Puerto Rican STEM undergraduate students who apply and are admitted to STEM PhD programs, and increase the number of these students who obtain STEM doctoral degrees. The total number of BD Fellows supported by PR-LSAMP since its inception would increase to 118. BD Fellows will participate in a series of development activities that will be provided or facilitated by the BD Program including: scientific seminars on interdisciplinary or frontier research topics; seminars in ethics of science; and workshops to develop scientific research skills as well as written and oral communication skills. Fellows will be encouraged to travel to and present at national and international scientific meetings and to complete a summer research internship at national and international partner research centers of PR EPSCoR and the Institute of Tropical Ecology (ITES). In addition, UPR's BD program will implement activities that develop mentoring and teambuilding skills. The Role Model Seminar series will bring the BD Fellows into contact with successful nationally and internationally recognized researchers thereby creating a mentoring environment that further equips the Fellows to fruitfully incorporate themselves into the greater research/industrial community."

It targets 7th-12th grade middle and high school students and their teachers. Concerns about how the response to a disseminated outbreak of Ebola in the US would be managed are legitimate given that even a cursory examination of the Internet reveals the extent that misinformation is driving public awareness. Much of the US population is inadequately equipped to evaluate information provided by the media: More than half has difficulty in understanding and using health information, another segment is inherently suspicious of ""official"" information and a final segment has limited English language skills. We clearly need alternative routes to communicate critical information that: (a) are managed by scientists and clinicians who understand the nuances of infection and public health and who are able to explain clearly why information and directions can evolve over time, and that (b) occur in interactive settings where misinformation can be directly addressed. The high school classroom is the last place where entire cohorts of the US population gather to learn at the same time without regard to their health literacy, ideology or English language status, providing an ideal venue. This project will be developed by an established curriculum design team of biomedical scientists and Boston Public School teachers who have created a successful curriculum ""The Great Diseases"" that provides 10th-12th grade students with opportunities to acquire and apply problem-solving skills through collaborative inquiry. We will leverage this experience to generate a stand-alone suite of lessons (1 for middle school and 3 for high school) to address key scientific and public health questions related to Ebola. The project has two key elements: first to provide teachers with a complete platform of educative materials and interactive online support to enable them to implement the lessons in the classroom. Second, to involve families in the learning process so that students can act as a conduit for legitimate information. The resources developed will be freely available and accessible online.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project relates to both students and teachers: 1) It provides students will a curated range of up-to-date information within a structure that enables them use active inquiry and problem solving to understand key issues, while teaching them the characteristics of reliable information and how to seek it out. Importantly, we will leverage our previous work with the Great Diseases curriculum that demonstrated how students that are engaged in the material communicate more with their families about the topics they are learning to structure the lessons to include family participation, asking families to evaluate an informational brochure students have created in the language spoken at home. 2) It provides teachers with resources and support in a familiar format, enabling them to effectively transfer this complex, dynamic information to their classrooms. The impact of the project relates to its significant potential for national and international impact. We have actively worked with over 150 teachers and about 12,000 students throughout the US and our approach to teaching and learning has successfully fostered student engagement in disease-related topics, knowledge of the health science underlying disease and healthy behaviors and critical thinking abilities and the improved self-efficacy that is important for continued independent learning. The largest gains were seen in inner city urban public schools and were independent of gender, ethnicity or English language learner status. We have also reached many more: Since 2013 people in 42 US states and 41 countries have accessed our freely available resources. More than 45,000 of these views lasted > 2 minutes, an indication of interest. We will leverage the breadth of this impact by providing an interactive blog for FAQs and by asking teachers to upload representative public health brochures to create a freely accessible, vetted, multilingual repository"

National-level activities, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, have positively impacted thousands of women. They cannot, however, reach all women. In particular, national meetings have limited ability to recruit women from isolated areas of the country, to include women at institutions that cannot afford expensive and time-consuming travel to national meetings, to provide leadership roles, to encourage participation by high school students, and to support interactions that are frequent enough to spark and sustain collaborations among budding students and professionals. This project -- called WWW.2 for Wide Web of Women -- aims to overcome these impediments. The project will create twelve new and upgraded Regional Celebrations of Women in Computing that will bring students, faculty and indistry representatives together for biennial conferences. The conferences will increase women?s participation in computing through intentional role modeling, networking, group and indivudal career mentoring, providing career information, and oportunities for experiences in presenting their work. The attendees will be encouraged to continue their interactions between Celebrations, for example, by forming ACM-W student chapters, hosting multi-institutional get togethers, and maintaining connections through a wiki. Focusing on women (as well as regions) serves a population powerfully united by gender, yet diverse in experience, with personal stories varying by race, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation. This ""Web of Women"" will build momentum toward a tipping point of cultural change in stereotypes about gender and computing."

The question chosen for study by a new researcher at Utah State University is: How can argumentation ability be enhanced among middle school students? This study involves 325 middle school students in 12 class sections from 3 school districts in Utah and Idaho. First, students in middle school science classrooms will be introduced to problem-based learning (PBL) units that allow them to investigate ill-structured science problems. These activities provide students with something about which to argue: something that they have explored personally and with which they have grappled. Next, they will construct arguments using a powerful computer technology, the Connection Log, developed by the PI. The Connection Log provides a scaffold for building arguments, allowing each student to write about his/her reasoning and compare it to arguments built by peers. The study investigates how the Connection Log improves the quality of students' arguments. It also explores whether students are able to transfer what they have learned to new situations that call for argumentation.<br/><br/>This study is set in 6th and 7th grade science classrooms with students of diverse SES, ethnicity, and achievement levels. The Connection Log software supports middle school students with written prompts on a computer screen that take students through the construction of an argument. The system allows students to share their arguments with other members of their PBL group. The first generation version of the Connection Log asks students to: <br/>1. define the problem, or state the problem in their own words <br/>2. determine needed information, or decide on evidence they need to find to solve the problem<br/>3. find needed information and record it <br/>4. organize information to make it useful for developing their claims <br/>5. develop a claim, or make an assertion stating a possible problem solution <br/>6. link evidence to claim, linking specific, relevant data to assertions <br/>The model will be optimized through a process of design-based research. The study uses a mixed methods research design employing argument evaluation tests, video, interviews, database information, debate ratings, and a mental models measure, to evaluate student progress. <br/><br/>This study is important because research has shown that students do not automatically come to school prepared to create evidence-based arguments. Middle school students face three major challenges in argumentation: adequately representing the central problem of the unit; determining and obtaining the most relevant evidence; and synthesizing gathered information to construct a sound argument. Argumentation ability is crucial to STEM performance and to access to STEM careers. Without the ability to formulate arguments based upon evidence, middle school students are likely to be left out of the STEM pipeline, avoid STEM careers, and have less ability to critically evaluate and understand scientific findings as citizens. By testing and refining the Connection Log, the project has the potential for scaling up for use in science classrooms (and beyond) throughout the United States."

This project seeks to test the function of a few candidate transcription factors in the development of butterfly eyespots. Several transcription factors and gene circuits that are known to be involved in wing and leg development in Drosophila are hypothesized to be involved in the development of eyespots in butterflies. In particular, when Distal-less (Dll) is ectopically activated in Drosophila it causes complete leg duplications, thus suggesting a master regulatory function. In Bicyclus, Dll is expressed in signaling cells in the eyespot's center at the earliest stages of eyespot development, and moreover, variation in Dll is linked with variation in eyespot size. Have butterflies co-opted the same ""leg"" developmental circuit in the formation of eyespots? An activated ligand receptor, phosphorylated Mothers Against Decapentaplegic, pMad, is expressed in the eyespot field during early pupal development. Is the morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp) being produced at the eyespot's center, diffusing to surrounding cells and differentiating a complete eyespot pattern? Another transcription factor, Engrailed (En), is expressed in a ring of epidermal cells that correlates with the pattern of gold colored scales on the eyespot of the adult Bicyclus wing. Does En cause the differentiation of gold colored scales in eyespots? The experiments outlined in this project test these hypotheses by ectopically expressing Dll, Dpp, and En on the developing wing and observing whether, in the first two cases, a complete eyespot pattern differentiates around the site of expression, or whether, in the second case, gold scales develop at the site of expression. Additional experiments will test whether over-expressing Dll and Dpp at the eyespot's center will lead to differences in eyespot size. To induce ectopic expression the lab has developed a laser-assisted heat-shocking technique that will allow the activation of these genes in a controlled spatial and temporal fashion on the developing wing of transgenic butterflies. The heat-shocking technique has been successfully tested with a fluorescent marker gene but now this marker will be substituted for the coding sequences of Dll, Dpp, and En. Establishing a causal relationship between these genes and differentiation of eyespots or colored scales will allow the later examination of the relationship between the evolution of these genes and the evolution of the phenotype. Intellectual merit: Much work in evo-devo has been dominated by inferring novel functions for genes based solely on their novel expression domains. This project intends to go beyond the correlational evidence and to really test whether ""old"" developmental genes belonging to known gene circuits have been functionally co-opted to specify a morphological novelty in evolution, butterfly eyespots. Once this functional co-option is established future work will attempt to track the evolution of eyespots, from their creation throughout their various levels of quantitative and qualitative modifications. This long-term study will dissect the evolution of regulatory genes with a demonstrated key role in differentiating these adaptive traits. This project aims to test whether a few candidate genes display that key role. In addition, this project will make available a series of transformation constructs of wide applicability across organisms, as well as develop important tools for functional genetics in non-model organisms. Broader Impacts: Dr. Monteiro has currently involved one postdoc and 3 graduate students in this project. One is a woman and a member of the Native American tribe Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Another is a minority graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engeneering at Buffalo. These two students are both recipients of NSF IGERT training grants in Biophotonics, and are truly working at the interface of Biology and Photonics via an established collaboration with the Department of Electrical Engineering at Buffalo. She will continue to train graduate and undergraduates students alike in Population Genetics, Phylogenetics, and Developmental Biology, irrespective of gender and ethnicity, in order to provide them with a broad multifaceted approach to Evolution and Development."

Rogers (Yale University) will investigate the changing nature and functions of ""petro-states"" in the modern world economy. His research will focus on oil companies in present-day Russian society, using the Perm Region of the Urals as a case study. Lukoil, the primary oil company operating in the Perm Region, has pumped enormous sums of money into social and cultural projects over the last decade, often partnering with state offices and other companies to fund everything from museums and youth festivals to the reconstruction of churches and scholarly research on ethnicity. Rogers will explore the effects of these highly visible sponsorship activities on configurations of state and market, concepts of citizen and citizenship, and, ultimately, the petrostate itself, which appears to becoming quite distinct from the postcolonial oil-exporting states most familiar to social scientists.<br/><br/>Rogers will conduct research in four different districts of the Perm Region, in order to investigate the local significance of social and cultural projects funded by new oil wealth. He will collect primarily qualitative data through a variety of ethnographic research methods. Data will come from semi-structured and unstructured interviews, employment and training histories, cultural project narratives, histories of particular cultural objects, participant observation, and archival and newspaper research. <br/><br/>This research is important because existing social science research focuses primarily on international pipeline politics or the manipulation of oil wealth to support and contest political power. Very little is known about how oil has affected local society, culture, and state in today's global political economy. This project will be among the first to approach recent developments ethnographically, exploring and then theorizing the effects of oil-driven social and cultural change at the ground level."

These evaluations are predicted to occur when critical attributes of a social stimulus that control judgment (e.g., stimatizing attibutes such as gender, race, SES) are not at the respondent's focus of attention. In Part 1, a procedure will be used in which the attribute of fame is incorrectly assigned as a result of a bias in memory caused by perceptual familiarity. This procedure is used to identify that equal familiarity with male and female names results in a higher probability of assigning false fame to male than female names. Variations of this procedure will be used to identify the unconscious nature and limiting conditions of this bias, Part 2 will establish the generality of this phenononmenon to another social category, by using names that vary in perceived race and ethnicity, and judgments such as criminal and politician. Part 3 will present a method to study implicit attitudes, and attempts to conceptually differentiate the (cognitive) stereotype construct from the (affective) attitude construct. This research is designed to examine whether discrimination can be controlled by implicit stereotypes even in the presence of positive implicit attitudes. Together, the 3- part program of research seeks to demonstrate the value of implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice, to provide understanding of the subtle yet powerful information processing mechanisms by which biases in evaluation are produced, and to question the currently dominant conception that such evaluations operate primarily within consciousness."

This research explores how family medical decisions are made, a domain long recognized within anthropology as one of the fundamental drivers of culture. New technological advances have afforded couples new social and economic choices that were until now impossible, as social norms and biological constraints dictated having children within a relatively narrow window. The new technology of oocyte cryopreservation, a technology that can prolong a woman's fertility, may change women's lives in the 21st century. Touted as a revolution in the way women age, oocyte cryopreservation is being heralded as a fertility insurance policy, and particularly as a way for older career women to extend their biological clocks. This ethnographic research project will be the first empirical study of oocyte cryopreservation among women in the United States and Israel, two of the earliest entrants into this field of assisted reproduction, but with strikingly different legal, economic, religious, and cultural mandates surrounding reproduction. <br/><br/>Based in five major in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics where oocyte cryopreservation is now available, the study will involve in-depth semi-structured and reproductive history interviews with the first generation of egg freezers, assessing how variables such as education, career, financial stability, relationship status, ethnicity, religious background, medical diagnosis and fertility prognosis affect medical decisions. This project intends to examine the tensions between nature and culture, reproduction and production, and motherhood and work that are observable today in various debates about public health. It will also contribute vital new scholarship on assisted reproductive technologies within medical anthropology and science and technology studies. As oocyte cryopreservation technology evolves, so will the social, cultural, legal, religious, and ethical responses. This study promises to reveal another new interface of science and society, potentially answering a host of questions crucial to the production of sound social policy and relevant bioethical guidelines, which will guide various medical technology facilities and the individuals they serve."

Why do the longest insurgencies display low levels of violence? Why do many of these durable but small-scale conflicts occur in relatively capable states, such as India, Indonesia, Burma and Colombia, which could eliminate the rebels if they put all their effort into counterinsurgency? Why do these states tolerate these rebel groups as long as they use low-scale violence? The project moves beyond the usual explanations based on commitment or information problems, low state capacity, or regime type, and focuses on state motivations to explain why the longest insurgencies remain at low levels of violence. The project contends that certain developing states prefer not to put all their efforts into state penetration and state formation, and are willing to accept low stateness in certain areas. If rebels locate themselves in these areas of low stateness, these relatively strong states are willing to tolerate these rebel groups as long as violence remains below a threshold and does not threaten the political leaders. <br/><br/>The project tests its argument using a multiple level, nested analysis research design, which nests a sub-national comparative analysis of one such insurgency within cross-national statistical analysis of all insurgencies. The cross-national analysis shows that medium-capacity states with multiple insurgencies tend to have the longest insurgencies. The project examines one such medium capacity state with multiple insurgencies-India-and conducts a sub-national comparative analysis on the small-scale but durable Maoist insurgency, ongoing since 1980. The investigator tests implications of the argument on an events dataset for the Maoist insurgency (covering 2002-2008), created during prior field work and using district-level violence data for all states affected by insurgency. Nested within this all-India quantitative analysis, the researcher carries out a comparative analysis of the patterns of violence and counterinsurgency of two insurgency-affected contiguous states, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. While in both states the insurgency occurs in areas previously under indirect British rule with low state penetration, the patterns of counterinsurgency and violence are completely different for the two states. While Andhra Pradesh started serious counterinsurgency in the late 1980s, Chhattisgarh escalated counterinsurgency only in 2005. Using data gathered during field work, the investigator demonstrates that variation in threat perception by politicians from the insurgency explains variation in patterns of violence. This finding supports the broader argument that state motivations explain the low violence patterns of these durable insurgencies.<br/><br/>The project's intellectual merit lies in its emphasis on the need to incorporate elected officials and state employees, at distinct levels of government, into the analysis of conflict intensity and duration. The project also creates the first events dataset on any insurgency in India, thus making a major empirical contribution. That such a revolutionary insurgency recruiting from lower castes and tribes can actually co-exist with democratic institutions in the world's largest democracy should interest scholars of democracy, analysts of political violence, and development economists interested in the links between ethnicity, distribution of public goods, and conflict. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project stem from the fact that while these low-scale enduring conflicts do not lead to high annual fatality counts, their persistence leads to high human security costs in terms of health, education and environmental costs at the local level. The research is of high policy importance, since the Maoist insurgency has recently escalated and poses a grave security threat. The study of the origins of the insurgency may help policy makers understand how to improve local conditions in the areas with Maoist conflict. The project should also enhance understanding of choices of counterinsurgency measures. It will tell the story of underprivileged groups in Indian society and a war that until recently was hidden, and thus promises to increase awareness both in the international policy community and in the Indian urban milieu."

The first concerns how annual hours of work are determined, with a special emphasis on the largely unresearched issue of paid and unpaid leave. One objective of the study is to provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of work leave. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the Health and Retirement Survey, and other sources are used to provide a basic set of facts about how paid weeks of leave and total weeks of leave vary with wage rates, indicators of hours constraints, weekly work hours, labor market experience, job seniority, union status, supervisory status, firm size, race, gender, and occupation and industry characteristics. The study measures what happens to paid leave when workers change jobs and determines the degree to which leave is a rigid function of firm wide policy or is something that individual employees can bargain over. The broader goal of the project is to improve understanding of the extent to which people can choose between higher compensation and shorter hours and the terms of the tradeoff between them. The analysis will inform policy discussions concerning how the labor market can be modified to better accommodate men and women who are seeking to balance career goals with family obligations. <br/>The second part of the project examines the implications of downward nominal wage rigidity for a broad set of questions in labor economics. There is considerable evidence suggesting that firms are very reluctant to cut nominal wage rates, but there is little research on how barriers to wage cuts influence the personnel decisions of firms. The heart of the study is the development and estimation of a model of the hiring, wage setting, and layoff behavior of a rational, forward looking firm when nominal wages cuts for incumbent workers are too costly to impose. When choosing a wage to fill a vacancy and when setting subsequent wages, such a firm must take account of the fact that the nominal wage chosen today sets a floor on a worker's future wages. In the presence of uncertainty about current and future productivity, paying higher wages to increase hiring rates and retention increases the risk of having to either overpay the worker in a subsequent period or incur the cost of a layoff. The model is estimated and used to revisit a number of important subjects in labor economics where the consequences of nominal wage rigidity have been ignored in previous research. These include studies of the degree to which earnings rise with labor market experience and job seniority, studies of wage dynamics within jobs and across jobs, recent research on employer learning and wage dynamics, studies of statistical discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex, and research on the effects of inflation on the distribution of earnings. The study uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics."

This attributional gender bias involves the tendency to generate different attributions (explanations) for female versus male students' performance in math: boys' successes in math are attributed to ability, while girls' successes are attributed to effort; but, boys' failures in math are attributed to a lack of effort and girls' failures to a lack of ability (Fennema et al., 1990). The proposed research will test whether inducing an incremental (effort-based, malleable) theory of intelligence--as opposed to an entity (ability-based, fixed) theory--can reduce this bias among math teachers. If teachers view intelligence as malleable rather than fixed, then they should perceive both girls and boys as having the propensity to succeed in math. The attributional gender bias should be difficult to maintain when ascribing to an incremental theory of intelligence. <br/><br/>The project consists of a pilot study followed by the main study with three data collection points. The pilot study will be conducted to methodically develop stimuli to induce an incremental theory of intelligence and to refine the dependent measure for assessing attributional gender bias. The main study will be conducted to test the following hypothesis: participants in an experimental group exposed to incremental theory stimuli will engage in less attributional gender bias (1) relative to control group participants, who will not be exposed to the stimuli, and (2) at three points following exposure to the stimuli. Participants will complete assessments before and immediately after exposure to stimuli and during each of two subsequent semesters, in order to determine the duration of the hypothesized effects. This will allow investigation of whether the manipulation continues to impact teachers as they confront new and existing relationships with students.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit<br/>This research project is an effort to apply social-psychological research on attribution and intelligence theories to the issue of barriers to girls' learning and participation in STEM. Given the pervasiveness of the attributional gender bias documented by previous research, it is important to investigate what conditions can produce attenuation of the bias. Middle school teachers interact with large numbers of students who are at a critical transition period in their academic and personal lives. As a potential source of influence in girls' attitudes and responses to STEM, teachers create interpersonal dynamics and classroom conditions that may inhibit involvement with math and science, likely without consciousness of the psychological processes that guide their behaviors. Previous research suggests that an incremental theory of intelligence is associated with positive academic outcomes. If an incremental theory of intelligence can reduce attributional gender bias by broadening individuals' conceptions of intelligence and (by association) math performance, then this finding will expand our knowledge of what conditions facilitate girls' learning and interest in STEM.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The experimental design of the proposed research is such that it can be replicated by other researchers concerned with how social-psychological processes influence the adults who construct STEM educational environments for girls. Depending on the outcomes of this research, the project may instigate further research in the scientific community on the link between teachers' and students' gender attributions, conceptions of ability and performance, and teacher-student dynamics in relation to gender. Furthermore, because this research will be undertaken in a predominantly Latino working-class community, it would indicate whether previous findings on attributional bias and intelligence theories generalize to the proposed population. This project will be an initial step in approaching the issue of how girls' performance in STEM is perceived against the backdrop of ethnicity, culture, and socioeconomic status."

This will include identifying a national, representative sample of chemical businesses, gaining access to archival and current organizational data on male and female employment patterns, and administering an organizational survey to management.<br/><br/>Individual Experiences will be assessed through both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) investigation. A survey will be administered to a large, national, representative sample of women in chemical business and industry to assess their self-reported experiences in occupational preparation, entry, and advancement. A representative sub-sample of these participants (diverse in race/ethnicity, age, work setting, S&E sub-field, and education) will be interviewed to explore more specifically the variables that have inhibited or facilitated their career trajectories in the chemical industry.<br/><br/>Effective Interventions will be assessed through both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) investigation, as well as literature review. The quantitative portions of Studies 1 and 2 and the qualitative portion of Study 2 will include assessment of formal and informal strategies currently used by companies to increase women's participation; interviews also will be conducted with a sub-sample of management personnel from Study 1 regarding their perceptions of intervention strategies, to compare to the responses from individual women. These data will be combined with a literature review to identify best practices interventions.<br/><br/>Science and engineering (S&E) fields are considered crucial to U.S. economic growth and are expanding rapidly. Demographic trends indicate that women and minorities represent the greatest increases in workforce participation; however, the continued under-representation of women (including minority women) in S&E fields is well documented. Much of the attention to women's relative absence from S&E fields has focused on women in academe, and very little is known about women in other S&E settings. Industry is the largest employer of S&E workers, but women are less likely than men to be employed in the industrial sector. Data regarding why women fail to enter industrial settings in predictable numbers and what happens to them there are virtually non-existent. Moreover, very little is known about the prevalence or effectiveness of strategies currently being used to address the paucity of women in industry.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts of the study include:<br/>* Providing a model for the study of demographic diversity in one industry<br/>* Identification of ""best practices"" interventions to enhance the careers of women in S&E business and industry.<br/>* Training of graduate and undergraduate students in research methods of the social sciences."

SAB is defined as a subtle form of stereotypic bias in which women's science and engineering successes are spontaneously attributed to external causes (such as luck) and their failures spontaneously attributed to internal causes (such as lack of ability). This research explores whether the tendency to engage in SAB is promoted by being in educational environments perceived as unwelcoming to women. Features of unwelcoming environments include having few or no other female colleagues or role models, and witnessing subtle behavioral biases favoring men. It is proposed that female students pursuing science and engineering may come to engage in SAB, independent of their explicitly stated beliefs about women and science, as a result of stereotypic messages encountered in their environments. <br/><br/>This research unites three strong theoretical perspectives (gender distinctiveness, implicit stereotyping, and achievement attribution) to advance understanding of women's lower participation in science and engineering compared to men. The SAB concept is a unique contribution based on sound research evidence in social psychology placed in a new theoretical framework, i.e. as an unintended, implicit attributional bias that is increased by stereotypic environmental cues and that influences academic outcomes. This project also promotes both basic experimental and applied intervention approaches to understanding, predicting, and improving academic outcomes among female science students. <br/><br/>In seven laboratory studies, the research tests these hypotheses: 1) female students in settings perceived to be unwelcoming to women [e.g., male-dominated settings and/or those in which behavioral biases favoring men exist] will show greater SAB than women in settings more welcoming to women; 2) SAB predicts diminished motivation for and performance in science and engineering among women; 3) female science and engineering students who do not evince SAB show increased academic persistence after success feedback, whereas women who engage in SAB do not; 4) the implications of SAB will be different for White vs. African American women due to differences in the content of stereotypes regarding their race/ethnicity; and 5) an intervention designed to reduce SAB can improve women's science outcomes, as a result of increasing internal attributions for their science and engineering success. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The proposed research advances discovery about factors influencing female science students while promoting teaching, training and learning as undergraduate and graduate students will participate fully as student collaborators in all aspects of the project. Members of underrepresented groups will participate in the proposed research, as this project focuses directly on an important underrepresented population (women in science), and reserves key roles for racial minority and majority male and female students as research assistants as well as respondents. The proposed research will serve to enhance infrastructure for research and education, as computer technologies will be developed and collaborative contacts will be made with the university's Center for Research and Learning on Teaching, the College of Engineering, and related departments, encouraging and facilitating future research collaborations. Broad dissemination of the results of the research will include research presentations and publications, in both psychology and education journals. Moreover, these results will be shared with educational, research, and diversity programs. Finally, this project will offer important and significant benefits to society, as understanding the processes influencing women in science is critical in moving toward the goal of greater representation of women in science and scientific innovation."

X-ray crystallography provides one of the most powerful venues for the visualization of proteins and other macromolecules in three dimensions at near atomic resolution. It is at the heart of structural biology, giving access to experimental data that allows scientists to make the connection between what molecules ""look like"" and how they function. The HighFlux HomeLab, consisting of the Rigaku MicroMax-007HF X-ray generator, with state-of-the-art optics, X-ray detector and cryo-system, enables high-quality crystallographic data collection with secure and automated features that facilitate access to research groups with diverse scientific interests and expertise. Until recently the kind of data that reveals molecular details of biological molecules at atomic resolution, particularly for small and fragile crystals, required travel to national laboratories such as the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory and other synchrotron X-ray sources. Synchrotron facilities are available to a specialized group of scientists with extensive experience in crystallography. The HighFlux HomeLab at Northeastern University will provide the venue for expert X-ray crystallographers to perform cutting edge research with close involvement of graduate and undergraduate students as well as for non-experts to expand the scope of their research to include structural biology. This equipment is highly complementary to structural biology equipment already present at Northeastern in the areas of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy and computational equipment, thus completing the major set of biophysical approaches used in state of the art structural biology research. Scientific questions being addressed through this project will help elucidate fundamental understanding of cell signaling, DNA damage and repair, enzyme catalysis as well as more practical applications of structural biology to energy production, human disease and biomolecular engineering, the success of which is built on understanding fundamental processes.<br/><br/>Central to the use of the X-ray equipment will be a course in Macromolecular Crystallography, staged in the form of a workshop designed to integrate research, teaching and training in structural biology. Northeastern is at the forefront of experiential learning, with a Co-op system that places undergraduates in laboratories across campus, in the Boston area and beyond, for extended periods of full time research. The workshop will have input and support from the PI and coPIs, a facility's manager with a Ph.D. and extensive experience in macromolecular crystallography, an academic specialist and a graduate teaching assistant. This workshop course will welcome faculty, graduate and undergraduate students interested in X-ray data collection, structure refinement and analysis. Students will be encouraged to bring their own crystals, but projects will also be available associated with the PI's and coPI's research groups. As research in the 21st century becomes ever more multidisciplinary, this course will provide ""hands on"" experience so that researchers in various areas of expertise can integrate structural biology in thinking about their science, with the ability to make a critical assessment not only of structures collected at Northeastern, but also of those deposited in the Protein Data Bank, along with the associated data. <br/><br/>The highly integrated research, teaching and learning environment enabled by this project will take place in a very diverse environment in terms of the researchers involved. In addition to being highly productive scholars the senior personnel on this project are diverse in terms of race, ethnicity and gender. Four out of the five are women, one Latina, one Native American and one African American. Current graduate and undergraduate students in the PI's and coPI's laboratories include 26 women, 18 men, 5 African Americans, 2 Native Americans and 1 Latina. Young women and minorities on this project will see the possibilities of success for themselves as reflected in their role models and will be encouraged to continue to do science, helping to increase representation for these groups in our scientific research communities nation wide."

In our increasingly global economy, students must be adequately prepared to meet the demands of the engineering workforce. However, many students do not have international exposure prior to college or the experience of interacting with others from a variety of backgrounds. As such, understanding how to improve team interactions within culturally diverse groups can provide novel opportunities for students to more deeply appreciate differences in engineering teams while simultaneously deepening their understanding of engineering concepts. This project is focused on how students participate in diverse engineering teams in first-year courses and how their participation impacts students' multicultural effectiveness and diversity sensitivity. Multicultural effectiveness and diversity sensitivity have been shown to help achieve a common group identity that is essential to effective teams. This project is motivated by two broader goals in the engineering education community and promoted by ABET which are complementary: 1) to graduate students with an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams and 2) to give students the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions globally. Understanding the experiences of students engaging in engineering design and the resulting shifts in attitudes will help identify practical ways to increase students' understanding and appreciation of people from diverse backgrounds. These interventions may change the culture of engineering at these institutions to make it more inclusive of underrepresented students. This project is supported by the Research in Engineering Education program and the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, specifically the ECR Research in Disabilities Education area of special interest. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. This research project contributes to foundational knowledge about broadening participation in STEM.<br/><br/>This sequential explanatory mixed methods study will address the gap in the current literature to understand how students interact in diverse teams. Student demographic data will include race, ethnicity, gender, disability and other information to be used as variables in the data analyses and interpretations of the findings. The first phase of research will quantitatively measure effects of diverse team formation on diversity sensitivity and multicultural effectiveness. A baseline survey of student attitudes will be collected at the beginning of their first-year engineering class before students are grouped into teams. Students will be grouped into diverse teams via the Comprehensive Assessment for Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) and surveyed mid- and end-semester to track changes in diversity sensitivity and multicultural effectiveness based on team composition using time series structural equation modeling. Additionally, social network analysis will be used to understand how students work within and outside of their assigned teams on engineering tasks to identify boundary crossing individuals within engineering. Finally, multiple streams of data will be collected on team interactions during engineering tasks (audio recording, video recording, observation, and work products). The second phase of research will conduct interpretative phenomenological interviews with students to understand students' experiences working in diverse teams. Students participating in interviews will also be asked to complete Implicit Association Tests to elicit in-group preferences. The use of interpretative phenomenological interviews allows for the creation of understanding through the analysis of students' lived experiences while still allowing the researcher to leverage understanding from existing literature. This qualitative methodology allows us to successfully transfer interpretive results beyond the bounds of this work to advance the conversations around diverse teaming in engineering. By combining the methodologies outlined in this work we can identify members of the community who are made ""out-group"" members by their peers and empirically understand the practices of individuals that drive the creation of out-groups and these students' experiences in engineering teaming environments.

This award to Howard University is co-funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, specifically the ECR Research in Disabilities Education area of special interest. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Howard University has teamed with three other Historically Black Universities - Morgan State University, Hampton University, and Prairie View A & M University - to conduct a large empirical study of Black women undergraduate students in STEM. The overall goal of the project is to investigate the intersectionality of their existing identities (gender, race and disability) and the identity that they acquire as STEM students on their way to earning a degree and the impact of the intersectionality on their participation, retention and success. The project is guided by an evaluator, as well as an external advisory committee. <br/><br/>For decades, researchers have examined the issues related to broadening the participation, retention, and success of individuals underrepresented in STEM. However, there is limited data on Black women, who over time have become an increasingly larger portion of the available talent pool. Past research on women and Blacks in STEM has not focused on the identities of race, gender and disability. The identity of being Black and female uniquely influences the pathways that students take to reach degree goals and be successful in STEM careers. The study will investigate the impacts of the intersectionality of existing identities (gender, race and disability) and the academic identity that they acquire as STEM students. The researchers will use a triangulation mixed methods approach to longitudinally collect qualitative and quantitative data to learn participants' perspectives and experiences from freshman to senior year. Additionally, those participants who self-identify as a person with disabilities will be invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Purposive sampling will be employed to ensure an adequate number of students with disabilities participate in the project's qualitative data collection. Once data are collected and disaggregated, the variance in the educational experiences of students along the variables of ethnicity, racial identity, gender identity, disability, and academic major will be examined. It is anticipated that a better understanding of the complexity of the identities of these women will inform inclusion practices, particularly at the collegiate level, and perhaps serve as a predictive element in success."

In our increasingly global economy, students must be adequately prepared to meet the demands of the engineering workforce. However, many students do not have international exposure prior to college or the experience of interacting with others from a variety of backgrounds. As such, understanding how to improve team interactions within culturally diverse groups can provide novel opportunities for students to more deeply appreciate differences in engineering teams while simultaneously deepening their understanding of engineering concepts. This project is focused on how students participate in diverse engineering teams in first-year courses and how their participation impacts students' multicultural effectiveness and diversity sensitivity. Multicultural effectiveness and diversity sensitivity have been shown to help achieve a common group identity that is essential to effective teams. This project is motivated by two broader goals in the engineering education community and promoted by ABET which are complementary: 1) to graduate students with an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams and 2) to give students the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions globally. Understanding the experiences of students engaging in engineering design and the resulting shifts in attitudes will help identify practical ways to increase students' understanding and appreciation of people from diverse backgrounds. These interventions may change the culture of engineering at these institutions to make it more inclusive of underrepresented students. This project is supported by the Research in Engineering Education program and the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, specifically the ECR Research in Disabilities Education area of special interest. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. This research project contributes to foundational knowledge about broadening participation in STEM.<br/><br/>This sequential explanatory mixed methods study will address the gap in the current literature to understand how students interact in diverse teams. Student demographic data will include race, ethnicity, gender, disability and other information to be used as variables in the data analyses and interpretations of the findings. The first phase of research will quantitatively measure effects of diverse team formation on diversity sensitivity and multicultural effectiveness. A baseline survey of student attitudes will be collected at the beginning of their first-year engineering class before students are grouped into teams. Students will be grouped into diverse teams via the Comprehensive Assessment for Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) and surveyed mid- and end-semester to track changes in diversity sensitivity and multicultural effectiveness based on team composition using time series structural equation modeling. Additionally, social network analysis will be used to understand how students work within and outside of their assigned teams on engineering tasks to identify boundary crossing individuals within engineering. Finally, multiple streams of data will be collected on team interactions during engineering tasks (audio recording, video recording, observation, and work products). The second phase of research will conduct interpretative phenomenological interviews with students to understand students' experiences working in diverse teams. Students participating in interviews will also be asked to complete Implicit Association Tests to elicit in-group preferences. The use of interpretative phenomenological interviews allows for the creation of understanding through the analysis of students' lived experiences while still allowing the researcher to leverage understanding from existing literature. This qualitative methodology allows us to successfully transfer interpretive results beyond the bounds of this work to advance the conversations around diverse teaming in engineering. By combining the methodologies outlined in this work we can identify members of the community who are made ""out-group"" members by their peers and empirically understand the practices of individuals that drive the creation of out-groups and these students' experiences in engineering teaming environments. The findings of this work can have significant impact in how students are grouped and taught within engineering teams, which can improve students' experiences to make engineering more inclusive and teaming skills more effective."

This program, however, reflects the environments in which it is implemented, and is unique in addressing three major gaps in the present knowledge base: the effectiveness of support systems in increasing girls' persistence in science, mathematics, and technology (SMT); the contrasts in effects of interventions in an urban and a rural setting; and the effectiveness of materials reflecting rural environments in teaching SMT content. This program juxtaposes two environments--one urban, the other rural--in an intervention designed to recruit and retain middle school girls in SMT. Together, the two sites provide fertile ground for examining the effect of ""place"" on girls' lives and their relationships with SMT. The program has three goals: (1) to have an impact on the infrastructure of SMT curriculum design by providing examples of materials and methods indigenous to rural environments and useful in SMT education; (2) to create advocates for the inclusion of girls in SMT education; and (3) to add to the knowledge base about rural and urban SMT education with respect to ethnicity and culture. The reach the goals, there are four thrusts: (1) to develop and test a strategy for constructing a social network made up of community members, family, and peers who advocate for and support girls' involvement in SMT; (2) to design materials and strategies that recruit and retain girls in SMT; (3) to conduct an ethnographic study that examines how girls, guardians, and teachers perceive the role of girls in SMT; and (4) to produce one or more documentaries to demonstrate (a) the social contexts in which rural and urban girls interact with SMT education, (b) barriers to their full participation, and (c) changes over time when systems exist to support and validat e their worth and competency in SMT. An examination of the intersection of girls and culture is critical to understanding the participation of girls in SMT. To effectively communicate these dynamics, we must give vision and voice to the girls in the project. Although the project is being implemented in only two sites, the resulting documentary, ethnographic study, and materials will greatly magnify its impact. As we examine the support mechanisms that must be in place and the types of materials and strategies that engage these communities, we will increase our understanding of how to systematically acculturate girls in SMT. ***"

Less discussed and understood is the transnational transfer of health goods in the reverse direction. This will extend transnational migration studies by explicitly considering how the production of health spans national boundaries. This study focuses on a migration stream of workers between the dairies of western Wisconsin and workers' communities of origin in central Veracruz, Mexico to answer the following questions: 1) How does the interaction of various dimensions of social marginalization-gender, language, ethnicity, citizenship, documentation-shape migrant health practices? 2) How, and to what extent, do different levels of incorporation into receiving societies shape the transnational health practices of migrants? 3) To what extent are the transnational health practices of migrants gendered? Data used to answer these questions will be collected through one year of participant-observation methods and in-depth interviews with current dairy workers in Wisconsin and former dairy workers in Veracruz. A key theoretical part of this investigation is identifying the role of immigrant incorporation in the formation of transnational health practices, thus contributing to current sociological debates in the area of migration. Secondly, this research will contribute to the sociology of gender and health by tracing how transnational health practices are shaped by gender relations. <br/><br/>This study is timely given that recent health reform and impending immigration reform will very likely affect the way immigrants experience health care access and incorporation in receiving communities. This study offers a window into the lives of migrants at the margins of society as they negotiate access to health services and rely on transnational ties to manage health problems. The results of this research will provide important information not just for scholars, but for state agencies and immigrant advocates. Reports of findings will be shared with Wisconsin state representatives and various immigrant advocacy organizations at the state and national levels. Additionally, co-investigator will maintain connections with scholars in Xalapa, Veracruz to encourage dialogue between American and Mexican scholars on migration issues. The results of the study can inform future health policy and promote international academic alliances by shedding light on how immigrants get their health needs met in a context of constrained or restricted health access."

In addition to excavation, the team will also conduct limited survey to find other sites and examine comparative materials from other locations. The fundamental question Dr. Boone wishes to address is how rural communities respond socially and economically to cycles of economic and demographic growth and decline associated with succeeding regimes of conquest and administration. In Portugal, these include the Romans, Visigoths, Muslims, and Christians and cover the period from approximately 100 to 1500 A.D. An ancillary issue to be addressed is the problem of ethnicity and the social organization of medieval populations inhabiting the dry upland areas of the Iberian Peninsula where irrigation was impossible. These populations are known to have been distinct from groups in better watered regions. This research is important because it will provide insight into how relationships develop and are changed over time between urban and rural areas. The conditions which held in medieval Portugal still apply today to many areas in the Third World, and the complex relationships which exist between rural inhabitants and the ruling urban elite (who are often culturally distinct) complicate regional politics and developmental efforts. Thus, the work may have practical relevance. Archaeology has a unique contribution to make in such studies because it can examine such relations over long spans of time."

It examines four questions that have been the subject of much controversy in recent years. One, are social cleavages declining in importance as factors predicting individual voting behavior? Two, do party strategies, issue and attitudinal differences, and social, economic, and political contexts explain the patterns of change over time across each cleavage? Three, what individual and macro-level factors explain cross-national differences in the importance of cleavages? And four, what has been the impact of these changes on the electoral coalitions of major political parties?<br/><br/>To answer these questions, the project creates an original data set containing pooled information from over 200 surveys done in 23 countries since 1945. The investigators recode the data to provide cross-nationally comparable information on each respondent's class location, religion, gender, political attitudes, and voting behavior. They next combine the survey data with national figures on ethnic-linguistic and religious heterogeneity, percentage of women in the labor force, percentage of regular church attendees, levels of social mobility, and welfare state expenditures. They lastly add information to the data set on party platforms for most of the nations. The investigators not only use the data to address the substantive questions about changes and national differences in social cleavage-based voting, but also make the data available to other researchers interested in comparative voting behavior."

This project seeks to test the function of a few candidate transcription factors in the development of butterfly eyespots. Several transcription factors and gene circuits that are known to be involved in wing and leg development in Drosophila are hypothesized to be involved in the development of eyespots in butterflies. In particular, when Distal-less (Dll) is ectopically activated in Drosophila it causes complete leg duplications, thus suggesting a master regulatory function. In Bicyclus, Dll is expressed in signaling cells in the eyespot's center at the earliest stages of eyespot development, and moreover, variation in Dll is linked with variation in eyespot size. Have butterflies co-opted the same ""leg"" developmental circuit in the formation of eyespots? An activated ligand receptor, phosphorylated Mothers Against Decapentaplegic, pMad, is expressed in the eyespot field during early pupal development. Is the morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp) being produced at the eyespot's center, diffusing to surrounding cells and differentiating a complete eyespot pattern? Another transcription factor, Engrailed (En), is expressed in a ring of epidermal cells that correlates with the pattern of gold colored scales on the eyespot of the adult Bicyclus wing. Does En cause the differentiation of gold colored scales in eyespots? The experiments outlined in this project test these hypotheses by ectopically expressing Dll, Dpp, and En on the developing wing and observing whether, in the first two cases, a complete eyespot pattern differentiates around the site of expression, or whether, in the second case, gold scales develop at the site of expression. Additional experiments will test whether over-expressing Dll and Dpp at the eyespot's center will lead to differences in eyespot size. To induce ectopic expression the lab has developed a laser-assisted heat-shocking technique that will allow the activation of these genes in a controlled spatial and temporal fashion on the developing wing of transgenic butterflies. The heat-shocking technique has been successfully tested with a fluorescent marker gene but now this marker will be substituted for the coding sequences of Dll, Dpp, and En. Establishing a causal relationship between these genes and differentiation of eyespots or colored scales will allow the later examination of the relationship between the evolution of these genes and the evolution of the phenotype. Intellectual merit: Much work in evo-devo has been dominated by inferring novel functions for genes based solely on their novel expression domains. This project intends to go beyond the correlational evidence and to really test whether ""old"" developmental genes belonging to known gene circuits have been functionally co-opted to specify a morphological novelty in evolution, butterfly eyespots. Once this functional co-option is established future work will attempt to track the evolution of eyespots, from their creation throughout their various levels of quantitative and qualitative modifications. This long-term study will dissect the evolution of regulatory genes with a demonstrated key role in differentiating these adaptive traits. This project aims to test whether a few candidate genes display that key role. In addition, this project will make available a series of transformation constructs of wide applicability across organisms, as well as develop important tools for functional genetics in non-model organisms. Broader Impacts: Dr. Monteiro has currently involved one postdoc and 3 graduate students in this project. One is a woman and a member of the Native American tribe Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Another is a minority graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engeneering at Buffalo. These two students are both recipients of NSF IGERT training grants in Biophotonics, and are truly working at the interface of Biology and Photonics via an established collaboration with the Department of Electrical Engineering at Buffalo. She will continue to train graduate and undergraduates students alike in Population Genetics, Phylogenetics, and Developmental Biology, irrespective of gender and ethnicity, in order to provide them with a broad multifaceted approach to Evolution and Development."

More importantly, this inventory supports national curricular reform and improved literacy in mathematics and science by providing universities and colleges a means to determine if their general education math and science programs have truly made a difference in the lives of students. It also reinforces the constructivist tenet that the effective application of knowledge depends not only on how much knowledge students have and how they organize it, but also on the feelings they associate with that knowledge and especially the value they place on it.<br/><br/>The major component of this project is the development of the Science and Math Values Inventory (SaM-VI).

The researchers have assisted the government partners in formulating the challenges and envisioning solutions; hence the research team is will positioned to leverage the substantial financial and human resources being invested by NIH National Cancer Institute and its partner government agencies in the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed project is a pioneering effort at incorporating social network referral tools as an integral part of collaborative systems within the context of digital government. First, the proposed project will extend theoretical understanding of the emergence of collaboration network structures involving multidimensional networks, where nodes may be individuals, documents, data sets, services (such as visual-analytic tools), or keywords/concepts. Second, it will pioneer theory development and testing about the influence of network referral systems on collaboration outcomes. Specifically, the proposed project will assess the extent to which collaboration outcomes are influenced by (i) different theoretically-derived structures of network referrals, (ii) different incentive structures provided to users of the network referral system, (iii) different types of network data used to generate referrals, and (iv) different information visualizations used to represent network referrals. Third, the research will extend the exponential random graph modeling techniques that have been largely used to estimate structural dependencies in relatively small (typically no larger than 500) one-dimensional networks. The proposed project will extend these techniques to multidimensional networks containing over 10,000 nodes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: As cyberinfrastructure is deployed to support collaboration among large communities in government and elsewhere, it is increasingly obvious that social network tools have immense potential. In this project the researchers will seek to respond to the refrain 'if only the Tobacco Surveillance Epidemiology Evaluation Network knew what it knew.' Generalizing the relevance of this same refrain to a wide spectrum of other contexts is suggestive of the broader impacts of the proposed research. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately generalizable to the design and deployment of social network referral tools to support collaboration among other digital government efforts within public health and beyond. Further, the government and non-government partners in this project are exceptionally well-equipped to incorporate into their regularly scheduled education, training, and outreach workshops the skill sets of collaborative fluency afforded by the judicious use of network referral systems. Finally, by definition, social network referral systems have the potential to increase the likelihood of drawing in more diverse constituents within the public health community (in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, seniority, disciplinary perspectives) than heretofore possible. This extended network will also offer opportunities for mentoring of previously disadvantaged members within these communities."

GENI promises to support the experimental exploration of robust new networking , distributed systems, and service architectures. It will advance and revolutionize large scale understanding and development of these areas. <br/><br/>In order to support the GENI design and development processes, BBN Technologies, Corp. will serve as the GENI Project Office (GPO). Working closely with the computing research community, the GPO will assume responsibility for the project management necessary to successfully complete all planning, design, and development activities essential to adequately prepare for GENI construction. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: GENI is envisioned as a comprehensive, continental-scale research facility that will allow controlled end-to-end experimentation with new architectures, protocols, services, data dissemination techniques, and more, running over an extensive national fiber optic infrastructure with next generation dynamic optical switching and routing, fully programmable core and edge nodes, heterogeneous sensor networks, wireless networks and other edge devices. All infrastructure will be shared among a large number of individual, simultaneous experiments and will be instrumented for the collection, analysis and pooling of measurements.<br/><br/>In order to manage such a complex endeavor, BBN Technologies will establish a dynamic and effective GPO that provides project management, high-level system architecture, engineering, and operations planning leadership. The GPO management structure and processes will include the broadest possible participation from both academic departments and industrial partners, so that nearly every mechanism in the GPO can be used to encourage broad community participation, throughout the planning phase. <br/><br/>This project entails two basic types of activities: (1) detailed planning documents must be prepared and pass review; and (2) construction risks must be identified and rapidly driven down, via analyses, prototypes, experiments, and trial integrations. <br/><br/>BBN understands all the technologies required in GENI, and has built large systems incorporating all of them, from optical networking, through field-deployed urban radio networks, to large-scale distributed software systems. BBN will bring discipline and clarity to the community's vision, and provide credible, realistic, and low-risk plans for constructing GENI -- the keys to successful design reviews. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The construction of GENI and the research that GENI supports is intended to lead to a revolution in information and communications technology as significant as the digitization of communication in the 1950s and the development of the Internet in the 1970s and 1980s. It is essential that everyone participate in this revolution, not just top-tier universities. Accordingly, BBN has structured every part of the GPO's planning processes to aggressively recruit underrepresented groups and institutions into GENI planning, including those of gender, ethnicity, disability, geography, etc. The project includes concrete actions, with objective metrics, for GPO success in building facilities, instrumentation, networks, and ongoing partnerships with underrepresented groups and institutions, for training and education, and for spreading the benefits of GENI experimentation broadly throughout society."

They offer high surface resistance even when contaminated due to their water repelling or hydrophobic nature, and hence increasing system reliability. When the hydrophobicity is temporarily lost, it can be recovered due to the migration of low molecular weight chains from the bulk to the surface. This recovery characteristic is central to their many applications, including cable terminations, insulators, and surge arrestor housings. Being organic, a major concern in using the polymeric materials is their long term performance, since electrical discharges can physically degrade the material. The present standards mostly concentrate on testing materials and insulators at the worst case conditions with little correlation between the failure modes encountered in the field and the tab. The insulators in field experience synergistic stresses from electrical voltage, UV radiation, humidity, contamination, and temperature change. Thus, there is a need to test these insulators in a multistress environment similar to that they are expected to serve. Investigating the aging and recovery characteristics of polymeric insulating devices under multistress conditions is a very practical and challenging problem, the results of which can be applied directly. The research supported under this proposal will be directed toward developing a better understanding of the long term performance of polymeric insulating devices under synergistic environmental stresses. This kind of applied research is very much needed by industry to analyze, understand, enhance and expand the knowledge of the widely used polymeric insulating materials under a wide spectrum of outdoor conditions. This is because a polymeric insulator that serves best at one environment fails miserably in another environment, and it needs to be resolved as to what material and formulatio n is needed for a given environment. Graduate and undergraduate students in Electronics and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET) department will be working on this project. An attractive serendipity is that this research can also be used as an educational aid to students in the power system courses offered in the ECET department. With ASU's partnership with the Maricopa Community Colleges (both being one of the largest of their kinds in the nation), it provides an excellent opportunity to introduce power engineering aspects and techniques to the next generation scientists and technologists of varying gender, ethnicity, and geography. The PI is entering the second half of her assistant professor years, and has shown significant promise in the classroom and in the laboratory. A POWRE grant will provide the essential equipment, supplies and time to help the PI focused in her academic career."

The SENCER approach is to connect science education with civic engagement by teaching science through the study of complex public issues. SENCER models are teaching, for example, biology through the study of HIV disease or the Human Genome Project; physics through the study of the challenges of nuclear disarmament or hypotheses about the origins of the universe; chemistry through the study of air pollution, water quality, or crime; and mathematics by examining the reliability of statistics, studying risk/benefit analysis, or decision-making.

SENCER faculty are learning to use an assessment instrument developed with partial support from several NSF initiatives to improve undergraduate education. This instrument is known as Student Assessment of Their Learning Gains (SALG) and is freely available for public use at WWW.WCER.WISC.edu/NISE/CL1. There are four key pieces of the SENCER project. SENCER Institutes are the core activity. These are team-based residential institutes for faculty, administrators, and advanced graduate students planning to initiate SENCER approaches. SENCER Clusters are both disciplinary and issue-oriented groups of faculty and administrators that operate to provide ongoing support and sustain reform efforts arising from participation in the Institutes. The SENCER Virtual Community links innovators together and supports dissemination of resources to support reform. The SENCER Leadership Initiatives are focusing national attention and recognition on exemplary initiatives in order to build additional support for this approach."

The common 8-semester clinic sequence is inherently multidisciplinary since it is taken simultaneously by all engineering students. However, multidisciplinary teams in industry are usually comprised of non-technical as well as technical personnel. To encourage the creation of multidisciplinary teams that contain both engineering and liberal arts majors, project topics must be created that appeal to a wide audience. Music is a topic that inherently unites college age students regardless of their major, ethnicity, religion or sex. The Creative Audio Technology Environment (CREATE) capitalizes on the unifying theme of music to encourage creation of diverse product development teams made up of engineers and music and other liberal arts students.<br/><br/>The Creative Audio Technology Environment (CREATE) at Rowan University is a multidisciplinary audio development studio and laboratory wherein students from three different colleges within the university collaborate on innovative audio design projects. Housed in a dedicated facility within the Department of Music but shared equally among students and faculty from engineering, music and physics, CREATE contains a dedicated 24-channel mixing console and audio recording equipment consisting of an 8-track ADAT, DAT, analog cassette and CD recorders. The development studio also contains microphones, audio effects processors, amplifiers, monitors and an HP spectrum analyzer.<br/><br/>The objectives of the Creative Audio Technology Environment at Rowan University are to: 1. Provide students with a state-of-the-art audio development studio to encourage rapid product development of audio related products, 2. Introduce engineering students to the importance of considering the customer (e.g., music students) to develop a quality product that meets desired customer attributes, 3. Promote the profession of engineering, not only to engineering students, but to liberal and fine arts students as well, by allowing a diverse student body to take part in a product development endeavor with music as the underlying theme, a theme which inherently unites students and faculty alike, 4. Provide a laboratory to teach the scientific principles of music and sound to a multidisciplinary audience.<br/><br/>The proposed CreATE laboratory is an adaptation and implementation of several existing courses and laboratory programs throughout the country (Miami, WPI, Georgia Tech and KSU) which have used audio related projects as a means of presenting principles of electronics, sound and vibration, and product development. The major program example from which ideas and materials are adapted is that of Kansas State University. The CreATE laboratory combines the best aspects of this program (and others) and enhances the multidisciplinary component by ensuring that there is an active, regular interaction with students and faculty in the music department."

In 1991, the University of Arizona started a two-semester sequence ""Introduction to Global Change"" to teach non-science majors about the Earth system. The course teaches basic scientific principles in the context of global problems and challenges facing scientists, policy makers and citizens alike. The current project further develops this general-science course sequence in order to more fully integrate information technologies into the courses, and to explicitly design materials that promote collaborative learning and critical thinking skills through several different instructional strategies. PIs are working with an independent, professional evaluator to develop and implement 10 modules for the two-course sequence. A module is a course unit focusing on a single topic, and involves laboratory sections, lectures, homework, discussions or other resources. The focus of their efforts is on: i) developing computer-based laboratory exercises as the centerpieces of the modules, ii) implementing the computer-based tools with the classes, iii) assembling and preparing the additional material needed to complete each module (e.g. visual aids, study questions, background material, references), and iv) documenting each module in a workbook for the classes. The workbook, including documentation of software and data, will be made available to faculty at other colleges and universities interested in developing similar global-change courses. An important aspect of this project is the explicit assessment of the effectiveness of different instructional strategies on students of different gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class. This multidisciplinary teaching effort is part of the University of Arizona's global-change resea rch program."

These applications are in problems in which the statistician is an integral member of the research team. The objectives of the symposium are to: (1)identify and focus attention on specific implementation and theoretical problems that hinder applications of Bayesian methods, and to identify candidate solutions; (ii) provide a forum in which the interplay between statistical theory and practice will be explored in the context of concrete research projects; (iii) provide a small-meeting atmosphere within which junior investigators and graduate students can explore substantial Bayesian applications with experienced researchers; and (iv) produce a volume containing well-documented case studies and data sets suitable for use by researchers, practitioners, educators and students of applied statistics and other quantitative fields. Today there are increasing amounts of background information available to scientists undertaking an investigation. It is important to utilize previousknowledge effectively in designing studies and analyzing data. Bayesian statistical methods are tailored to this purpose. There have been many recent advances in Bayesian statistical theory and computation, but scientific meetings rarely spend substantial time discussing successful applications of these methods to substantive scientific problems. This symposium concentrates attention solely on applications of Bayesian statistics. The application areas range from economics to population biology . The result will be the elucidation of the interplay between theory and practice and the identification of successful methods that will point to important directions for future research. The interactions and dynamics of the workshop will be captured and disseminated via video tape and in the more traditional written form of a conference proceedings."

Faculty at nearby high schools and community colleges also visit the campus and have access to the instrument for their own courses and students. FT-NMR experiments are being integrated into undergraduate service courses. Students are introduced to 13 C-NMR early in general chemistry, leading into more detailed applications of NMR in the organic chemistry sequence. Advanced FT-NMR techniques including correlation experiments and spin-lattice relaxation measurements are being adapted into upper-level courses and undergraduate research. This project impacts many underrepresented students in terms of gender, ethnicity, and class and thereby better prepares them for scientific employment and graduate and professional studies.

In this project, classroom time is being used to help students develop conceptual understandings that incorporate the ability to view phenomena from multiple perspectives. Classroom activities stress active learning and scientific exploration. Topics and methods are used that reflect contemporary science integrated with the personal experiences and interests of students. Interactive-multimedia materials, showing synchronized multiple representations of chemical species and phenomena, are being developed and used in classrooms and by groups of students. A sense of ownership of new materials and commitment to their use is being developed by involving faculty, from all institutions, in their selection, design, development and evaluation. Student versions encourage group learning and exploration. Training workshops are aimed at assisting faculty in implementing the multimedia materials in manners that promote more active learning environments. Evaluations assess: 1) changes in classroom pedagogy, 2) achievement gains of students, and 3) changes in students' attitudes toward science. Project products will be nine multimedia modules, student versions of each module, training workshops and their support materials, assessment materials and research analyses of the effectiveness of all products."

The colorful and functional patterns on the wings of butterflies provide ideal material for evo-devo research because 1) they are variable both within and across the 12,000 described species, 2) because they represent visually compelling products of selection, often with a known adaptive value, and 3) because the two-dimensional epidermal wing surfaces, where pattern formation takes place, are very amenable to developmental, molecular, and phenotypic characterization. Among the most common pattern elements within the nymphalids are the eyespots: distinct concentric rings of differently colored scales. Eyespots are thought to mimic the appearance of vertebrate eyes, and can either startle an attacking predator or deflect the attack towards the margin of the wing. Recently it was shown that three transcription factors, Spalt, Sal;, Engrailed, En; and Distal-less, Dll, are expressed in the eyespot field of Bicyclus anynana during the pupal wing stage. Sal and Dll are expressed in a central disc of the eyespot, where black scales differentiate, while En is present in a ring of cells around the central disc, correlating to the pattern of gold scales in the adult wing. Additionally, in a mutant line of B. anynana, ""Goldeneye,"" Sal is absent from the central disc of cells, while En is expressed in the whole eyespot field, and the adult pattern consists of an entirely gold eyespot. The experiments outlined in this proposal will test whether there is a causal involvement of Sal and Dll, on the one hand, and En, on the other hand, in differentiating the black and gold colored scales of an eyespot, respectively. The technique of germ line transformation in B. anynana will be developed in order to test whether these genes have been functionally co-opted to specify novel patterns in evolution. Development of a heat-shock promoter system that can activate these transgenes at specific times during development will also be attempted. The function of the candidate genes will be determined by ectopically expressing them in the eyespot field and testing their function and sufficiency in specifying the fate of the colored scales. If, as expected, a causal relationship is established between the transcription factors and differentiation of the colored scales, the ultimate goal will be to dissect the evolution of the regulatory regions of these genes across selected lines within B. anynana, across closely related species with divergent eyespot morphologies, and ultimately across species with and without eyespots in order to understand the relationship between DNA sequence variation and morphological evolution. <br/><br/>Merit Criteria I: Much work in evo-devo has been dominated by the characterization of the genetic pathways involved in the development of different species, often times from different phyla. Although comparative studies can, and have, generated fruitful results, studies of variation at the intra-specific level and among closely related species should not be neglected. Indeed, adaptive evolution primarily involves the sorting by natural selection of phenotypic variants present in individuals of the same population, not in individuals of different species. It is important to understand the generation of such intra-specific variation, as well as the possibly more ""saltational"" mechanisms of gene co-option by comparing the evolution of a set of developmental genes across the Lepidoptera. These aims can be achieved by dissecting the evolution of regulatory genes with a demonstrated key role in differentiating adaptive traits. This project aims to test whether a few candidate genes display that key role. <br/><br/>Merit Criteria II: Dr. Monteiro is a new faculty member currently training 2 undergraduate students and two female graduate students, one of which a member of the Native American tribe Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. This excellent and very promising graduate student has already begun working on the project described here. Dr. Monteiro will continue to train graduate and undergraduates students alike in Population Genetics, Phylogenetics, and Developmental Biology, irrespective of gender and ethnicity, in order to provide them with a broad multifaceted approach to Evolution and Development. In addition, this project has a cross-disciplinary component where graduate students will be working with members of the Physics department and taking appropriate graduate courses in that Department as well."

Despite recent reading initiatives, students in the upper elementary grades are not sufficiently prepared to interpret and learn from informational text, precluding full attainment of reading competence and interfering with their ability to learn from subject matter text. This is particularly the case for poor urban youth. The most likely explanation for this situation is the absence of opportunities for students to learn how to comprehend text, reflecting teachers uncertainty about how to teach reading comprehension, especially with respect to supporting learning in subject matter areas with ambitious educational goals.<br/>Paradoxically, there is a significant and robust knowledge base regarding effective reading comprehension instruction. The challenge is to represent and disseminate this knowledge base effectively and powerfully. The intervention we propose integrates the resources accumulated by three programs of comprehension research with strong evidentiary bases (Reciprocal Teaching, Questioning the Author, and Guided Inquiry supporting Multiple Literacies). Specifically, we propose to conduct controlled experiments in which we compare two models of professional development. One model, informed by cognitive flexibility theory, features the use of hypermedia-based videocases, while the second features the same information, presented via traditional video-based cases. In addition to supporting teachers learning of the targeted instructional techniques, the content of these cases will address assessment, individual differences, teacher mediation, and text- and domain-specific (to science) comprehension instruction.<br/>In each year of the proposed project, participants include 60 teachers from 30 schools (1500 students), randomly assigned to one of two conditions. SES data for targeted districts indicate that students qualifying for free- or reduced-cost lunch range from 12% to 66%; and ethnicity data indicate that 7%, 51%, and 75% of the students in the targeted districts are African-American, while the remainder are principally White. Measures of teacher knowledge/beliefs/orientations and practice, as well as student measures of general and domain specific reading achievement will be collected to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the effects of using hypermedia-based videocases versus traditional video-based cases on the development of teachers knowledge/beliefs regarding reading comprehension instruction; (2) What are the relative effects of these tools on teachers reading comprehension instruction practices; (3) What are the relative effects on students comprehension of general and specific subject matter text, measured by standardized assessments; And (4) How are outcomes mediated by teacher characteristics (e.g., knowledge, self-efficacy), student characteristics (demographics, achievement), and features of school and policy contexts that relate to successful buy-in. Throughout the study, a central focus is on identifying features of successful professional development that are scalable."

The problems given to students will be part of active and current research areas in pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and mathematical computation. Throughout the summer, students will be exposed to theoretical constructs, computational techniques and real world applications, and will develop background and skills that will help to prepare them for further study or employment in a mathematics-related career.<br/><br/>As a way to broaden access to, and the impact of, mathematics in the larger community, Bard will offer some REU slots to talented sophomores who are just beginning to consider careers in mathematics, as well as to students who have decided to major in mathematics as late as their junior year. We are determined to make this experience a tipping point for students who are mathematically talented but undecided about whether to pursue a career in mathematics. Moreover, with its attention to students who arrive early or late to mathematics in their college careers, Bard's REU will help to retain mathematical talent that might otherwise disappear when individuals with unorthodox academic preparation fail to fit into more traditional math and science programs. Thus, Bard's REU will increase the base of U.S. citizens who are highly trained in mathematics. Moreover, Bard's REU will contribute to broadening this mathematically qualified base by prioritizing gender parity in the students selected, as well as diversity in race, ethnicity, and mathematical background."

National-level activities, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, have positively impacted thousands of women. They cannot, however, reach all women. In particular, national meetings have limited ability to recruit women from isolated areas of the country, to include women at institutions that cannot afford expensive and time-consuming travel to national meetings, to provide leadership roles, to encourage participation by high school students, and to support interactions that are frequent enough to spark and sustain collaborations among budding students and professionals. This project -- called WWW.2 for Wide Web of Women -- aims to overcome these impediments. The project will create twelve new and upgraded Regional Celebrations of Women in Computing that will bring students, faculty and indistry representatives together for biennial conferences. The conferences will increase women?s participation in computing through intentional role modeling, networking, group and indivudal career mentoring, providing career information, and oportunities for experiences in presenting their work. The attendees will be encouraged to continue their interactions between Celebrations, for example, by forming ACM-W student chapters, hosting multi-institutional get togethers, and maintaining connections through a wiki. Focusing on women (as well as regions) serves a population powerfully united by gender, yet diverse in experience, with personal stories varying by race, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation. This ""Web of Women"" will build momentum toward a tipping point of cultural change in stereotypes about gender and computing."

The University of Pittsburgh, has fostered a strong educational focus both in research and in teaching - on facilitating a student's ability to engage in knowledge integration. This is timely as recent technological advances have altered the landscape of engineering training in the US, prompting students to eschew simply mastering one distinct area and instead focus more at the intersections of two or more technologies. This is especially true in the area of biotechnology/biomedicine, nanotechnology, and energy, where future challenges necessitate that research scientists and engineers be trained in a diverse range of emerging technologies and are able to seamlessly traverse the boundary between these seemingly disparate technology areas. This is accomplished by combining the traditional research of an REU site with a tailored workshop series, a (product) translation exercise, and an innovating cross-training internship. Workshop topics include: product innovation, particle production - inorganic and organic, microscopy techniques, suspension/rheology measurements, particle-based simulation, information literacy, ethics, communication skills. Project evaluation consists of both assessment of the various goals associated with the project objective as well as an overall evaluation of the students who have participated in the program. In monitoring the students who participate, the proportion of students from underrepresented groups will be tracked (i.e. gender, ethnicity) and compared to the overall proportion of students studying engineering. To address the larger, overall success of the project, tracking of the number of students who participate in the program and matriculate into either a graduate program or the workforce will be performed via continuing to build a LinkedIn.com community. Finally, in addition to the direct statistical measures and fellow tracking outlined above, qualitative and quantitative measures of the degree to which the program attains its goals will be performed using a comprehensive assessment plan that includes, surveys, concept mapping, and process map development.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Today's advances don't happen in isolation, but instead occur at the intersections of two or more technologies. This is especially true in biomedicine, sustainability, and energy. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program focuses on Particle-based Functional Materials (PFM). This research focus is studying particulate materials that fulfill a specific function, either because of their discrete nature or due to the influence of particles on macroscopic structure. Such systems include: material self-healing, controlled delivery of therapeutics, ""smart"" catalysis, and particle separations, to name a few. This program is based on the premise that the successful engineer of the future will need to be able to seamlessly traverse the boundary between these seemingly disparate technology areas. In order to equip the participating students to become the ""nimble thinkers"" necessary in the changing economy, the PFM-REU program explicitly focuses on enhancing students' knowledge integration skills as well as their ability to engage in product innovation, while building their base of knowledge in a specific area. This program will educate 12 undergraduate research fellows in each of its three years. These students will be recruited from primarily undergraduate institutions and students from under-represented groups."

Increased enrollments in the various graduate programs in engineering have prompted the institution to re-evaluate their infrastructual requirements, including the physical facilities where research and research training activities are conducted. Currently the Mayaguez campus trains approximately 11,000 students including 600 graduate and 4,000 undergraduate engineering students mostly of Hispanic ethnicity. Over twenty percent are female students. Recognizing the need for the renovation, the University and the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will jointly provide the resources to see the improvements to fruition. The following six laboratories will be renovated: Heterogeneous Catalysis and Electrochemistry, Biochemical Engineering, Anemometry, System Dynamics and Control, Fatigue and Fracture, and Material Science. Renovations will involve upgrading temperature and humidity control and air conditioning systems, installing fume hoods, laboratory benches and cabinets, and equipping labs with proper safety mechanisms. The remodeled facilities will sustain the current growth trend in graduate programs and house modern instruments needed to pursue advanced training in engineering. The renovation will immediately have an impact on the Department of Chemical Engineering as it establishes a Ph.D. program. New perspectives for the future of chemical and mechanical engineering will occur by the renewed experimental scientific capabilities the renovated facilities will provide. Collaborative interactions within various departments will be promoted as well as with other universities and national laboratories. With the prolific promise of academic achievement, the project will enhance research programs that will draw prospective undergraduate and graduate students from Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and South America. ***"

Three institutions join efforts for this purpose: University of Colorado at Boulder, University of Colorado at Denver, and University of Washington. FA, in the context of the study, is viewed as a process contributing to the science learning of ELLs, as opposed to the administration of discrete sets of instruments to collect data from students. The study targets Spanish-speaking, elementary and middle school students. Findings from this study contribute to advance knowledge and understanding of FA as an inherent component of the science learning process in linguistically diverse classrooms, and to define a research agenda aimed at enhancing science teachers' ability to enact equitable and effective assessment practices for this student subpopulation. <br/><br/><br/>Three research questions guide the work: (1) What FA practices are occurring in science classrooms that serve predominantly mainstream students and in those serving predominantly ELLs?; (2) How are teachers' FA practices for mainstream students different from or similar to those used with ELLs?; and (3) How do contextual factors and teachers' cultural and linguistic competencies influence FA practices? To address these questions, two conceptual frameworks are used--one for characterizing FA events; the other for examining FA events as a communication process. The study employs a mixed-methods research approach with emphasis on case studies. The sample size consists of three school districts in Colorado and Washington, 16 classrooms (8 elementary, 8 middle school), 16 teachers, and 96 ELLs. Classrooms are selected to represent a particular combination of four factors: (a) teacher ethnicity, (b) teacher formal academic preparation in teaching ELLs, (c) type of linguistic student background, and (d) grade level. Students are selected through a stratified random sample, identified by achievement level (i.e., low, medium, high), and linguistic background (i.e., mainstream, ELL). Data collection strategies to document the implementation of FA at the beginning, during, and at the end of a science unit include: (a) classroom observation protocols, (b) classroom video-recording, (c) video/artifact simulated recall, (d) assessment artifacts, (e) student interviews, (f) teacher questionnaires, (g) teacher interviews, (h) school principal interviews, and (i) school observations. Reliability and validity of most of the data-gathering instruments is determined through pilot studies. Data interpretation strategies include: (a) coding based on the two conceptual frameworks, (b) scoring rubrics to identify levels of effectiveness, and (c) narratives and profiles to describe FA patterns. Publications and the development of a website constitute the main dissemination strategies. A technical advisory board is responsible for formative and summative evaluation. Key evaluation questions are: (1) To what extent does the project enhance research on ELL FA practices through case studies?, and (2) How effectively do the project dissemination activities facilitate understanding of FA practices? <br/><br/>Major project outcomes include: (1) a description of the patterns of formal and informal FA practices for ELLs; (2) a comparison of the FA practices observed in classrooms that vary on the dimensions of teacher characteristics and linguistic diversity; and (3) an empirically and theoretically informed set of findings and strategies for supporting teachers to enact and enhance FA practices sensitive to cultural and linguistic diversity. Three main products are developed: (1) a monograph describing the FA practices observed across the different classrooms with concrete examples; (2) a description of possible professional development strategies to improve in-service FA practices for linguistically diverse students; and (3) a research-informed approach for analyzing FA practices. Besides filling the existing research gap on FA with ELLs, outcomes and products serve as a foundation for a future research agenda and a comprehensive project aimed at ensuring equitable science learning for all students, including ELLs."

Most studies, however, do not consider the implicitly embedded temporal dimension in the provision of public goods, i.e. often the costs are incurred now and the benefits from the public good received later. While a voluminous and growing literature investigates intertemporal choices in individual decisions, other than Deck and Jahedi (2011) - who examine discounting behavior in a competitive environment - there is little research providing empirical evidence on how individuals make intertemporal choices in strategic interactions. In this project the co-PI will address: 1) how the timing of benefits affects voluntary contributions when the benefits are realized in the future, including whether expectation of how others' discount the future influences decision-making, 2) how the timing of contributions affects voluntary contributions, and 3) how individuals discount future provision of public goods in strategic, socially heterogeneous environments. To address these questions, the study employs a novel experimental design that varies (a) the timing of benefits received from public goods and from private consumption in a Voluntary Contribution Mechanism (VCM) game, (b) the timing of contributions towards public goods in the VCM game, and c) the social heterogeneity of participants in the public goods game based on their affiliation with student cultural organizations.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this research will help shed light on the roles of social distance, temporal preferences and their interactions in the provision of public goods. Empirical findings that behaviorally unpack the role of time and social preferences in collective action scenarios will contribute to explaining the mechanisms of non-cooperation when heterogeneous populations interact to provide public goods with delayed benefits. Furthermore, the findings of such a line of inquiry could inform many policy and real-life decisions, in addition to other intertemporal choices that have a strategic component to them. Study findings will be of relevance to scholars and policy-makers concerned with intertemporal choice and the provision of public goods."

These evaluations are predicted to occur when critical attributes of a social stimulus that control judgment (e.g., stimatizing attibutes such as gender, race, SES) are not at the respondent's focus of attention. In Part 1, a procedure will be used in which the attribute of fame is incorrectly assigned as a result of a bias in memory caused by perceptual familiarity. This procedure is used to identify that equal familiarity with male and female names results in a higher probability of assigning false fame to male than female names. Variations of this procedure will be used to identify the unconscious nature and limiting conditions of this bias, Part 2 will establish the generality of this phenononmenon to another social category, by using names that vary in perceived race and ethnicity, and judgments such as criminal and politician. Part 3 will present a method to study implicit attitudes, and attempts to conceptually differentiate the (cognitive) stereotype construct from the (affective) attitude construct. This research is designed to examine whether discrimination can be controlled by implicit stereotypes even in the presence of positive implicit attitudes. Together, the 3-part program of research seeks to demonstrate the value of implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice, to provide understanding of the subtle yet powerful information processing mechanisms by which biases in evaluation are produced, and to question the currently dominant conception that such evaluations operate primarily within consciousness."

From the standpoint of neighborhood effects research (that is, understanding how the social context in which you are embedded shapes your life outcomes) there is the persistent thorny question of selection: are observed differences in outcomes across neighborhoods due to differences in neighborhood context, or due to differences in what leads a person to be in a particular neighborhood in the first place? In the area of residential segregation, theories of its causes have focused on preferences, discrimination, and economics but have been largely silent on the residential search process and how it contributes to segregation. Evident in both areas of research is that we know relatively little about the process of neighborhood selection. However, what we do know points to the importance of understanding people's experiences, knowledge, and perceptions of communities throughout their metropolitan area. We need to know how people live in cities: which neighborhoods they access on a regular basis, how they perceive various neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, where they search for housing when it is time to move, which areas they know little about and/or avoid, and which factors determine where they choose to live. Existing data-collection tools are inadequate for efficiently collecting data on these potentially crucial aspects of residential selection because they have focused on perceptions of the neighborhoods in which people do live, and have tracked movements of individuals across space, but they lack information on perceptions of other potential residential locations?those not occupied by the respondents. They also do not answer questions about how those perceptions are shaped by daily experiences, residential histories, and social networks. <br/>The purpose of this project is to develop an innovative computer-aided survey tool to measure individuals' perceptions, experiences with, and knowledge of, a large number of communities and neighborhoods within their larger metropolitan area. The tool, which will utilize interactive, computer-based mapping features, will be designed for incorporation into a large-scale survey designed to assess the multifaceted factors that drive processes of neighborhood choice and maintain residential segregation by race and ethnicity. This new set of survey tools will permit, for the first time, the collection of detailed data about how individuals, access, experience, and perceive large numbers of neighborhoods within their region. This information, when combined with survey data on individual economic characteristics, family dynamics, social attitudes, and other factors that shape residential decision-making will provide the ability to test both traditional theories of the causes of racial residential segregation and previously unexplored factors related to knowledge of, experiences in, and perceptions of communities in the metropolitan area. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>The social problems at the core of this research proposal?racial inequality in particular, and the influence of neighborhood conditions on individual outcomes in general?are of great social significance and concern. Residential segregation has been shown to have an array of negative consequences for individuals and communities across a host of outcomes, including health, education, employment, and exposure to crime. To understand how to address these problems, it is critical to understand the processes that generate them. Our proposal offers the development of a set of innovative tools to collect data on previously ignored facets of these residential selection processes. The topic and project will be of interest beyond sociology: social scientists across a range of disciplines are interested in the question of how context, especially neighborhood of residence, shapes life outcomes. From the standpoint of survey methodology, the project also promises innovative uses of survey technology in general (use of laptop/tablet combinations in CAPI), and mapping technology in particular (for survey measurement, as against the sample management and interviewer assignment tasks for which it has been used previously)."

This research extends research on an on-going project on developing an on-line, game-like learning environment called APLUS (Artificial Peer Learning environment Using SimStudent) in which students learn by teaching a synthetic peer called SimStudent. Learning by teaching is an exciting and innovative approach to learning and instruction that is often reported to be effective in classroom trials. However, little is known about the underlying cognitive and social theory on how and when students learn by teaching. Although some studies have shown a potential for scale learning by teaching through implementation in technology, very little is known about the transformative theory to successfully implement learning by teaching. To address this issue, the researchers build on their current work to further develop the theory of learning by teaching and to understand how best to achieve the theory development through advanced technology support. The researchers also investigate the similarities and differences between learning by teaching and learning by being tutored to better engineer effective advanced learning technology. In particular, the researchers propose to improve the effectiveness of APLUS by providing adaptive scaffolding for students to teach SimStudent correctly and appropriately. The researchers also propose to collect detailed process data that show fine-grained interactions between the student and SimStudent in addition to outcome data, which are test scores. By combining the process and outcome data, the researchers will explore the cognitive and social theory of learning by teaching. The researchers hypothesize that providing help on how to solve problems (cognitive help) and how to tutor (metacognitive help) will facilitate tutor learning. They also conjecture that the interaction between cognitive and metacognitive help will yield a rich learning environment that, in combination with the unique characteristics of learning by teaching, will be more effective than learning by being tutored. The following research questions will be addressed:<br/><br/>Q1: Does cognitive help facilitate tutor learning? If so, how and why?<br/><br/>Q2: Does metacognitive help facilitate tutor learning? If so, how and why?<br/><br/>Q3: Is learning by teaching with the meta-tutor assistance better than learning by being tutored?<br/><br/><br/>Learning by teaching has been widely recognized to be effective for academically challenging populations, including African American students and underprivileged students. Therefore, the proposed intervention, if proven to be effective, would contribute to the development of effective STEM learning support system for all students regardless of their race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, or geographical locale in contemporary US classrooms. Since the entire proposed technology would run as a web-based application, the software products will be distributed widely and rapidly. The study data will be shared through the opendata repository, DataShop, under the direct supervision of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Thus, the research effort will contribute to the general learning research community by providing that community opportunities to conduct secondary data analyses."

It builds on the inventory of confirmed lynching victims/incidents that was created with previous support from the National Science Foundation. This inventory includes vital, but relatively limited, information about each event - location (state and county), race and sex of victim, date of occurrence, and purported reason for the lynching. The primary objective of this project will be to increase significantly the amount of information about victims that is available to researchers. The PI will search for each victim in the enumerators' manuscripts of the U.S. Census that preceded his or her lynching. For example, the investigator will search the 1880 census for victims lynched during the 1880s, the 1900 census for victims lynched during the 1900s, and so on. To conduct this search we will use the online and searchable original enumerators' manuscripts that are available through Ancestry.Com. Our search will begin, using the victim's first and last names, in the county in which he was lynched. When necessary, the PI will expand the geographic focus for the search to include counties of first-degree or second-degree adjacency to the target county. Larger geographic areas (e.g., states and neighboring states) will be searched for victims with uncommon names. Successful matches between the lynching inventory and census records will be determined by considering a number of factors, including the following: first and last name, sex, race, age, and location. In those cases where multiple matches are possible, the PI will invoke additional search strategies, including information from newspaper accounts, application of optimal matching techniques to names, and searches of enumerators' manuscripts from subsequent censuses. The resulting database will include all census information that is available from the household record and person records for the victim and for all co-resident individuals. Geocodes will also be included in the file in order to facilitate the linkage of contextual characteristics (e.g., for counties) to the individual- and household-level data. Pilot testing for Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee in 1880 and 1920 indicates a potential rate of successful matches of at least 40%.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The project will provide a data resource for researchers studying race/ethnicity, violence, inequality, and southern history. It will support richer and more rigorous, theoretically-driven, quantitative and non-quantitative approaches to the study of lynching by providing far more information about the victims, their families and households, and their communities than has ever been available before. The completed database will be made available through an existing data archive (e.g., the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research), or via a dedicated website at the University of Washington."

Within the U.S. and other ""western"" nations, for example, women in Arab nations frequently are assumed to have their identities primarily constructed or influenced by Islam. Corollaries to this assumption are views that all Arabs are Muslim, that all Muslims are Arab, and that Muslim women are more oppressed and less emancipated than their ""western"" counterparts. This extreme oversimplification of the vastly complex and diverse histories and people in the Arab world perpetuates a situation of misunderstanding and ignorance between countries of the region and elsewhere. This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the processes underlying Moroccan women's spatial practices and identity strategies in urban areas in France and Morocco. The study will focus on understanding how Moroccan women from different socioeconomic situations use space differently and how power and gender relations in households and urban areas come together to influence their mobilities, daily spatial practices, and identity strategies in different places. The concept of spatial practices as used in this study refer to the ways that women occupy and move through spaces in different ways, such as. using chaperons to go to cafes, walking in groups, using taxis as opposed to buses, socializing in particular parks, and avoiding streets at night. Identity strategies pertain to ways that women may mobilize certain aspects of their identity, such as accentuating or downplaying particular codes of dress, notions of femininity, questions of ethnicity or class, and political alliances. The comparative aspect of this research will allow for a consideration of the ways in which different national-cultural and socioeconomic contexts (France vs. Morocco, poor vs. non-poor) affect the degree and modes of Moroccan women's mobilities. Working in Montpellier, France, and Rabat, Morocco, qualitative research methods will be employed to gather primary data on a small number of Moroccan women's daily lives. Intensive in-depth interviews will be combined with time-geography diaries by working with female and male members of a limited number of Moroccan households on several different occasions. Time-geographies will be collected from all individuals interviewed. Interviews will be analyzed alongside time-geographies in an effort to understand the processes that influence women's mobilities, spatial practices, and identity strategies in urban areas in both France and Morocco. These data will be supplemented with daily participant observation and field notes, archival records, newspapers, and statistical sources. This study will contribute to theoretical debates currently taking place around questions of the role that place and mobility play in the construction of modern gender identities. It will shed light on the ways that different characteristics of the settings where women live influences their spatial behavior and identities. Understanding the factors that influence Moroccan women's spatial practices and identity strategies in France and Morocco will provide insight into how these women understand their own modern lives in a way that allows them to cope with the pressures and contradictions of contemporary urban life. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

Through provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1996 and 2000, some immigrant women are now able to leave their abusive spouses, without fear of deportation. The research will use a mixed-ethnographic approach to examine how VAWA provisions influence decision-making and safety planning for immigrant women who are victims/survivors of interpersonal violence. The main questions asked in this proposed study are: How do service providers/advocates assist their immigrant clients in navigating through their options for safety planning, including VAWA provisions? How do immigrant women negotiate their options in finding relief from their abusers and what role do VAWA provisions play in their decision-making? Broader implications for this research include: to assess how congressional intent to provide relief to battered immigrant women is working and inform policy development, to broaden understanding of interpersonal violence by addressing intersectionality of gender, race, ethnicity, class, and immigration, to hear from women themselves if the VAWA provisions are helpful in securing safety from violence, and to provide insight that will help service providers and social workers to better advocate for their immigrant clients."

Relatively little attention has been given to the links between labor markets and social processes within the labor force, however. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine these links through a case study of the changing composition of labor in the outerware garment industry of the Seattle metropolitan area. This industry has been a primary place of employment for many of the nearly 40,000 Asian immigrants who have moved to the Seattle area since 1985. As a result, most workers in the outerware industry now are women from southeast Asia. Secondary sources will be used to document the transformation of the industry in recent decades in order to establish a framework for consideration of industry's current structure. A second phase of the research will include analysis of quantitative data, including the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the U.S. Census of Population, in order to provide information about the household structure and labor-force participation of southeast Asian immigrants. In-depth interviews also will be conducted with garment industry owners and managers and with female garment workers from Vietnam and Cambodia to determine the circumstances of their immigration and the character of their experiences from both economic and social perspectives. This research will make important contributions to geographic knowledge in a number of different ways. It will add to empirically based insights into the general role of labor markets in industrial change and to the specific roles of gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class is the transformation of labor markets.

Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) promises to change modes of inquiry, research, and practice in earthquake engineering. When it becomes operational in October 2004, NEES will facilitate a major improvement in research by integrating experimental and computational simulation. Through unparalleled experimental, computational, and information technology resources, NEES has the potential to revolutionize the way that earthquake engineers conduct research and implement results into practice. This collaborative project involves eighteen researchers from ten universities. As such, it provides an ideal opportunity for demonstrating and challenging the new NEES model for conducting research and also addresses one of the most critical needs in earthquake engineering today: improved knowledge of soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFSI). The research plan involves four primary components: (1) four complementary experimental programs which will investigate key aspects of SFSI, (2) refinement of computational simulation models for SFSI, (3) management of the data and metadata generated in the investigation, and (4) outreach to the earthquake engineering community.<br/>Three of the four experimental programs will involve NEES Equipment Sites. The centrifuge tests will be<br/>conducted at the University of California, Davis, the shaking table tests will be conducted at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the field tests will use the mobile equipment from the University of Texas at Austin. Structural tests will also be conducted at Purdue University. The integration of computational and experimental simulation is a key feature of NEES, and the computational models will be used to design the test specimens, develop the testing protocols, and evaluate the measured response. An important deliverable of the project is improved computational models for SFSI, calibrated from the experiments, in a form available for community use. Other important features of NEES are the curated data repositories and a collaborative research environment. The project team includes researchers from the NEES System Integration Project (NCSA for data management and CREW for collaborative tools). The project team will thereby test the tools being developed by the System Integrator and contribute to the development of enhanced data and metadata models. In addition, the project team is committed to working with members of the earthquake engineering community during this research project. All design documents, simulation models, simulation results, material properties, and measured data will be available to the community via web-based tools. Many of the experiments will be webcast in real time, and video clips from all experiments will be available. An effort will be made to encourage members of the community to submit comments and suggestions to the research team based on the preliminary research plan and to develop separate proposals to complement the proposed plan. A series of prediction competitions are also<br/>planned to evaluate a variety of computational models. Two complete course modules for undergraduate courses will be developed based on the research. In addition, the project team will promote the project and discuss the results at appropriate meetings and conferences to generate interest and encourage participation among practicing engineers. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed research are extensive. By integrating the educational and research activities within the project, the team demonstrates a commitment to advancing discovery and understanding in earthquake engineering while promoting teaching, training, and learning at the undergraduate level. The research team is also committed to broadening participation of underrepresented groups. The research team comprises a diverse group of faculty with respect to technical expertise, educational philosophies, age, gender, and ethnicity. In addition, San Jose State University does not grant the PhD degree in civil engineering, therefore, these students will be exposed to opportunities not currently available at their host institution. The research team will also enhance the infrastructure for research and education by sharing all experimental, computational, and educational data developed as part of this<br/>proposal. This information will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding within the earthquake engineering community. The research team will also make a special effort to discuss the research results with engineers and decision makers in the state departments of transportation, thereby providing a mechanism for society to benefit from the results of the proposed research."

Building on previous research that shows that ECAs are as effective as humans when used to mentor undergraduate students interested in pursuing graduate school, the researchers will explore whether the research extends to high school students considering computing careers.<br/><br/>Guided by the ""possible selves"" and ""social cognitive career theory (SCCT)"" frameworks, researchers will examine students' perceptions of computing and computing careers before and after each career exploration fair, noting the effect and impact of questions and answers (Q&A), storytelling, and culturally relevant storytelling. The ECAs will represent minority individuals in authentic computing professions. The specific research questions are: 1) In what ways do students' career interests and perceptions change following virtual career exploration fairs using ECAs? 2) How do culturally relevant ECAs differ based on student perceptions and identities? and 3) What roles do gender, race, ethnicity, grade level, and location (rural/urban) play in students' career identities? Survey data will be analyzed to determine the relative impact of the virtual career exploration fair on student self-efficacy, interest in computer science careers, and predictive factors of the SCCT?<br/><br/>The project presents a potentially sustainable solution for motivating urban and rural high-need school districts to explore computing careers.

What role do these organizations play in the mediation between citizens and the local and state level government? To answer these questions, the proposed research will examine the role of NGOs in political participation in one Mexican city in a country whose political and economic terrain has undergone dramatic changes in the past two decades. The proposed research seeks to elucidate three major themes. First, the project investigates the strategies and tactics of the NGOs, which focuses on the severity, frequency, and range of collective action. Second, I explore the types of demands of the organizations, to whom do they make the demands, and what social groups do they claim to represent. Third, I analyze the differences of NGOs based upon the identity of the organization, such as class, gender, and race/ethnicity. This project is a field case study approach with multiple data collection strategies. Using a single embedded case study design, I examine the power relationships in how NGOs represent citizens' interests as well as how NGOs strategize their relationship with the State and other local institutions of power. I will conduct in-depth, tape-recorded interviews with the directors and members of the NGOs. Interviews will be supplemented by observations of NGO activities, such as meetings and demonstrations as well as archival research. This research is timely because of the recent political changes in Mexico and important because of the unique setting of Monterrey, which is a stronghold of an opposition party and a city that many scholars have tended to ignore. This research will make a contribution to sociology in several ways: In an era of political restructuring toward democracy and economic restructuring toward Neoliberalism and market economies, understanding NGO mobilization is important to build our knowledge of how these organizations provide access for citizens to the political process. This project helps to promote learning, teaching, and research across national boundaries and encourages cross-cultural exchanges between U.S. and Mexican scholars."

Eisenberg<br/>Peyina Lin<br/>Katherine Stovel<br/>University of Washington <br/><br/>Social groups and social technologies both play important roles in the lives of American high school youth. Many young people are also civically active ? they join community organizations, donate goods or time to charities, speak out on public and community issues, or become involved in student government. However, how social groups and technologies structure civic participation and shape social boundaries is not well understood. In this study, we examine how group and friendship structures affect students'civic participation; and how social technologies (including social network websites like Facebook and MySpace, instant messaging, and mobile devices) are used in friendship and civic groups. The research question is: To what extent do social technologies reproduce the interrelationships between friendship group structures and civic participation? Previous research has found a weak association between high school students' friends and their civic attitudes, yet this work has ignored the social context in which adolescents make friends. Within schools, social groups (recognizable via reputational labels such as ""jocks"" or ""populars"") embed students in a social status hierarchy that structures extracurricular opportunities (e.g., students may be systematically selected based on popularity, performance, or ethnicity). Drawing from social structural theory, as well as research on high school culture, adolescent reference groups, and adolescents' use of social technologies, this mixed methods study evaluates specific hypotheses about (a) the interrelationships between the status of school-based social groups and students' choice of civic activities; (b) the overlap between friendships and civic participation; and c) how social technologies affect the patterns observed in (a) and (b). Because social network websites create a level of awareness between friends not otherwise possible, some expect that these technologies have great potential to socialize youth into greater civic activity. We elaborate why such a simplistic proposition may not hold and the conditions in which social technologies moderate the link between friendship structures and civic participation. Three data sets (questionnaire, observations, and interviews), obtained from two high schools in the Northwestern US will be synthesized to test the hypotheses and explore new propositions. The questionnaire gathers data suitable for evaluating interrelations between the variables of interest, while the observations and interviews will inform how students define, cross, and negotiate social group boundaries both offline and online. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>Previous research has shown that civically active youth are more likely to be civically active adults. Thus, encouraging civic participation by high school youth is important to maintaining civil society, particularly now, when president Obama has challenged all citizens to get involved in their community. Yet, not all young people face the same opportunities to engage in civic activities. This study will help us understand how young people use social technologies to interact with one another. Results will suggest how educational institutions and technology designers can utilize these patterns in order to enhance opportunities for civic participation by diverse youth."

The guiding principle behind the conference is that it seeks to provide an opportunity for young social science faculty at HBCUs to articulate their research goals, the potential impact of this research on their teaching and what is needed to facilitate and sustain a research culture at their institutions. More generally, this conference is important because of its potential impact. The anticipated outcome is a set of strategies that can aid the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other funding agencies who seek to achieve greater diversity (i.e., institution, gender, race and ethnicity) in their support of research activities in the social sciences. <br/><br/><br/>The project proposes to identify and engage young and new social science faculty in the construction of strategies that will enable them to increase their participation in basic research. For example, as a first step, using doctoral degree production data from NSF's Survey of Doctorate Recipients as a measure of actual or potential basic research and expertise, the investigators have identified a group of HBCUs who are likely to expand their social science research capacity with additional funding. Within these institutions the investigators propose to identify young and new faculty who are currently engaged in research. The focus is on new faculty because they are seen as having the greatest likelihood of establishing and building a research culture for the social sciences at these institutions through increased exposure to funding opportunities and networking with researchers at other HBCUs and majority institutions.<br/><br/>The conference will consist of three plenary sessions with researchers who have successfully secured research funding and have studied or participated in projects to increase minority participation in the nation's basic research enterprise. Working sessions will be held to brainstorm and articulate what is needed to enable interested faculty at HBCU's to conduct basic research and to then integrate a research culture in their teaching activities. A funding opportunities session will also be held with program directors from NSF. Specific issues that will be addressed include: (1) cultivating research capabilities in junior faculty, (2) exploiting mechanisms for basic research funding, (3) the role of research in the primarily undergraduate institution, and (4) establishing a research culture for the social sciences.<br/><br/>The recommendations that emerge from the conference will be disseminated to HBCU's, NSF and other funding agencies. The ultimate goal is to outline strategies for a primary concern-- how both HBCU faculty and funding agencies can increase the number of scholars competing for research funds, the quality of proposals, and ultimately the success rate of investigators from social science scholars from HBCUs for large support grants."

This problem is compounded by the large class sizes of introductory college courses, which make it difficult to accommodate the background knowledge and the skills of individual students. Additionally, an e-learning environment has the potential to reach a broad audience through remote delivery, thus further increasing the impact of this approach. This enables community colleges and 4-year universities to move toward a true two-plus-two transfer program by allowing students to complete lower-level computer engineering courses remotely before transferring. <br/><br/>The adaptive learning materials in this project will be developed for use in an introductory digital circuits course and a logic design course. Both of these courses contain laboratory components that will also be addressed by this work. The materials will be developed as self-contained learning modules that can be used at different colleges with varying schedules (e.g., semester vs. quarter). The materials will consist of a unified, adaptive learning environment that can be implemented using any course management system (e.g., Moodle, Desire2Learn, Blackboard) to eliminate the need for proprietary software. An accompanying lab kit will facilitate hands-on learning in a low-cost, portable form factor to facilitate remote delivery and eliminate the financial barrier of offering a meaningful laboratory experience. The materials will be tested at a diverse set of institutions: Montana State University, a Ph.D. granting, research active university, MSU-Billings, a 4-year non-research university, Flathead Valley Community Colleges, the largest 2-year community college in Montana, and Salish Kootenai College, a Tribal College proving both 2-year and 4-year degrees for Native Americans. This broad range of participants will allow the team to assess the effectiveness of the adaptive learning materials while simultaneously considering the relationship between student background and the student learning experience. <br/><br/>Both quantitative and qualitative measures will be used to assess the adaptive learning modules. Direct measures will be collected on student performance, including the number of ungraded quiz attempts within an adaptive module, end of module exam scores, time required to complete a module, and time spent at each level of difficulty within a module. Surveys will be used to collect student satisfaction with the adaptive learning environment that will include feedback on their impression of content difficulty, workload compared to other courses of the same credit load, and their sense of how well the material was personalized to their needs. Student demographic information will be collected including gender, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic background, ACT scores and college credits obtained. This information will be used to understand how different groups use and benefit from the course materials. Focus groups will also be conducted with student participants at Michigan State University in order to collect qualitative data on student learning and attitudes toward the e-learning system. Phone interviews will be conducted with students from the other participating institutions. The interim findings from this assessment will be used as feedback to enhance the adaptive learning system in order to accommodate a broader range of participants."

The proposed project is designed to use the Engagement, Capacity and Continuity (ECC) theory to address issues associated with the underrepresentation of African American males in STEM. The objectives are to (1) identify the relationship between mathematics achievement and race-by-gender, engagement, capacity, and continuity variables and (2) develop, validate, and administer a psychometrically sound instrument that describes the ECC characteristics and experiences of African American males majoring in STEM disciplines. The proposal responds to recent calls for research specifically focused on African American males in STEM to help inform practice.<br/><br/>Using the ECC Trilogy for Student Success as the theoretical framework, the study is designed to identify factors that facilitate or serve as barriers to African American males' interest, experiences, and success in STEM disciplines. It will employ a two-phased approach to test the hypotheses: Phase 1 will examine relationships between race-by-gender interactions and ECC-related factors on math achievement using data from the Department of Education High School Longitudinal Study of 2009. Phase 2 will use the results and findings of Phase 1 to develop, validate, and administer an instrument to examine ECC characteristics and experiences of African American males majoring in STEM disciplines to ascertain the relationship between the instrument results and undergraduate STEM achievement. The project's potentially transformative influence lies in its ability to disentangle the issues of race and gender and their relationship to factors found to influence STEM interest and success. The findings could be especially useful to major research universities facing race/ethnicity and gender issues in their recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM."

The study explores to what extent adolescents actively and creatively make use of resources from popular culture and mass media for their own social purposes, and reproduce and transform their meanings; to what extent their linguistic practices reproduce dominant ideologies about language and social categories; and how ideologies of distinction with regard to race, ethnicity, and other axes of identity influence the stylistic practices of these adolescents. <br/><br/>The linguistic practices of 40 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 will be analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods, with data collected ethnographically. This work draws on linguistics, cultural studies, and anthropology to better understand contemporary linguistic practices of American Indian youth. Its findings may have implications for multilingual and American Indian education, as well as for developing both curricular and extracurricular activities that strengthen identity and have a positive effect on academic achievement. Finally, by considering relationships between popular culture and language revitalization, this study complements research that aims to better understand the importance of linguistic diversity, especially in the face of globalization."

Close to 90% of children in immigrant families perform a language brokering function in their family's resettlement process, taking on the task of translating between the heritage language and English for parents with limited English-speaking skills. However, scholars have thus far paid little attention to the developmental consequences of being a language broker. This project on Mexican American families will explore the language brokering experience from multiple perspectives (target child, mother, father). The goal is to illuminate how language brokering impacts parent-child relationships and, more importantly, how it affects children's adjustment in terms of both academic and socio-emotional outcomes. Three hundred fifty Mexican American families will be recruited for the project, from schools with a wide range of Latinos in the student population. The study has three research aims: 1) to understand how child language brokering affects parent-child relationships, including any differential effects for mothers and fathers; 2) to investigate how parent-child relationships may be linked to child adjustment in terms of both socio-emotional development and academic outcomes; and 3) to explore how adolescent gender and schools'/neighborhoods' density of Mexican immigrants may influence aims 1 and 2. This project has the potential to bring to light the effects language brokering may have on the adjustment of the children of Mexican immigrants, the largest and fastest growing minority group in the United States.<br/><br/><br/>This study will examine developmental outcomes for children of Mexican immigrants, a high-risk population with high rates of poverty and low levels of educational attainment. The project aims to understand the mechanisms involved in improving the academic performance of children of immigrants, a growing and significant percentage of America's children, who represent the future of the U.S. workforce. It also focuses on the developmental period of adolescence, a period of transition in which children are susceptible to developing socio-emotional problems that can compromise school performance. This research has the potential to identify risk factors that can be used to inform future preventive intervention work with children of immigrants. Finally, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students who have been traditionally under-represented in the sciences, particularly those of Mexican origin; deliver a curriculum to educate students about the role of immigration, ethnicity, and race in informing child development; and provide workshops, training sessions, and newsletters to educators on the role of language brokering in children's academic functioning."

In recent decades the U.S. government has focused a good deal of attention on increasing the presence of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. The science and technology labor force has already diversified in important ways over the past few decades. Women's representation in science and technology education and employment has increased significantly, though their representation remains considerably smaller in fields such as engineering and computer science. This research explores whether the particular components of the STEM labor force - such as the representation of women in particular fields, or the share of coworkers of a particularly nativity or race - are associated with retention in the STEM work force or the gender wage gap. In fields where women account for a larger representation of STEM workers, for example, is the gender wage gap narrower? How is that relationship influenced by the group size of foreign-born workers, and does it matter whether these workers received their education and training in the United States or abroad?<br/><br/>There are several social scientific views that can be evoked in seeking to account for the dynamics involved in occupational sex composition and occupational wage rates. These perspectives are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but each focuses on distinct ways in which employers may exhibit preferences by gender or ethnicity. Our project will utilize Queuing theory and Devaluation theory to explore how the changing composition of the STEM labor force promotes (or retards) the retention and earnings of women in STEM. Such an approach will enable us to move beyond a simple gender dichotomy (men/women) to assess variation within gender (native-born/foreign-born). Data come from pooling six waves of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), covering years from 1995 through 2008. SESTAT is comprised of three ongoing surveys designed to create a nationally representative sample of science and engineering college degree holders (Kannankutty & Wilkinson, 1999). The restricted SESTAT data include detailed information regarding labor force participation, occupation categories, educational attainment, and demographic characteristics. The proposed project will include three sets of analyses, including descriptive analyses establishing trends in STEM employment by gender and nativity, as well a time since degree; multivariate logistic regression models incorporating predictors of employment in a STEM profession, by sex, and how group representation of the foreign-born moderates these associations; and OLS regression of women's and men's logged wages on observable characteristics."

With the strong and continuing importance of religion to American society, it is particularly important to understand whether religious involvement is related to mortality risks as some recent research finds and, if so, to determine the magnitude and mechanisms that characterize this relationship. Major new work on the topic has been widely publicized and has made a major impact in both the social science and medical literatures. Nevertheless, this area of research remains highly controversial, theoretically and methodologically underdeveloped, and lacking in depth. Through completing secondary analyses of a number of existing datasets this research will tackle a number of other current limitations that characterize the religion-mortality literature. Specifically, it will address the issue of whether selectivity is responsible for the association between mortality and religion. There are a number of factors that may influence both religious involvement and mortality that can account for this statistical association. However, this is perhaps the key question that needs to be addressed by the scientific community in order to understand whether the religion-mortality relationship may be considered causal or spurious. Second, only very limited research has considered the differential effects of religious involvement on mortality within subgroups of the population. This inattention to the diverse demographic landscape of the contemporary US can lead to empirical findings that, while potentially true among the whole population, mask substantial heterogeneity within the population. Third, only scant attention has been given to the specific causes of death that are influenced by religious involvement. Fourth, only recently have several population-based data sources become available that allow inquiry into the association between religious involvement and mortality at the national level. Thus, compared to other social and demographic factors that are central in the sociological mortality literature (e.g., SES, race/ethnicity, gender, age, marital status) and critical to the understanding of health and longevity in the United States, knowledge regarding religious influences on health and mortality is clearly limited. <br/><br/>There is a major debate in the medical literature about whether medical schools should teach courses on religion and health and about whether physicians should or should not use the religion health-mortality literature as one of the guides toward informing their relationships with patients. However, the evidence to date is far too tentative to conclude that religious involvement promotes health, although it is clear that the recent seems to be leaning that way. But until the issues of selectivity are fully addressed, questions regarding the spuriousness of the overall relationship will remain. Beyond the overall relationship, the specific social and demographic groups that are influenced, and the specific mechanisms by which religion may influence health and mortality, are just now beginning to be tapped. Thus, this project has the potential to shed light on sociological issues that have captured substantial public attention, as well as the attention of both the social scientific and medical communities. Further, within sociology, there is substantial interest in this subject matter ranging from medical sociology to demography to the sociology of religion, with faculty members and students from each of these areas involved in the research and interested in the findings. Second, the project will further contribute to the long-standing and very productive partnership between the Universities of Texas and Colorado."

In the Mexico-Guatemala border city of Tapachula, Chiapas, the growing inflow of Central American immigrants and the subsequent creation of immigration policies have led to increased interactions between low- to mid-level officials and immigrants. Very little is known, however, about how these officials working on the ground interpret and implement their powers on an everyday basis; how their actions impact immigrant experience and exercise of social and political citizenship rights; and how immigrants respond to and negotiate interactions with these officials. Because of their power, low- to mid-level officials can affect immigrants' vulnerability to exploitation, domestic violence and other human rights violations that are increasingly prevalent in the region. This doctoral dissertation research project will describe low- to mid-level officials' everyday actions in implementing and interpreting migration policy, and it will demonstrate how low- to mid-level officials support or contradict official migration policies and understand the institutional norms that influence these actions. Additional objectives of this project are to understand and describe Central American immigrants' experiences with low- to mid-level officials, including how their experience varies across gender, ethnicity, race, and class, and to describe Central American immigrants' feelings of political citizenship and belonging as a result of their interactions with officials. The doctoral student will draw upon and contribute to theories on the micro-scale operations of state power in feminist geopolitics, feminist migration studies, and citizenship studies in geography. The project will employ a qualitative, multi-method approach based on in-depth interviews with officials and Central American immigrants; participatory workshops with immigrants; and participant observation of officials' interactions with immigrants in institutional spaces. All of these components will contribute to the construction of an institutional ethnography describing how officials and immigrants negotiate state power.<br/><br/>This project will broaden and deepen basic understanding regarding how migration policies are implemented and enforced on the ground as well as the resulting responses of immigrants. The project will contribute to academic theory and understandings of migration, and it will provide information and insights that will contribute to efforts to improve relationships between officials and immigrants.

The objective of this CAREER research is to develop an understanding of the parameters controlling the diffusion of polymers nanoconfined between interfaces and to use this information to construct theories that enable predictive capabilities. The dependence of bulk polymer diffusion on fundamental variables, such as chain length and temperature, is well understood and this information will provide a strong foundation for comparison of diffusion at the nanoscale. In this research, the diffusion of polymers nanoconfined between well-controlled planar interfaces will be studied using fluorescence techniques. Living polymerizations will be used to synthesize polymers with low polydispersity indexes containing covalently-bound, thermally-stable fluorophores that do not affect the glass transition of the film. The proposed research program seeks to: 1) Determine how diffusion coefficients of simple polymers composed of chemically identical units (i.e. homopolymers) are affected by the size of the confining dimension and by interactions between the polymer and the confining interfaces. 2) Identify the relationships between chain architecture and the fundamental mechanisms of interfacial diffusion by varying backbone rigidity, chain linearity (branched or star polymers), and by employing model block copolymers that self-assemble in specific ways when confined between interfaces with differing surface chemistry. 3) Develop theories, ascertain scaling relationships and construct predictive models that enhance capabilities for designing high-performance nanostructured materials.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to perform a study of polymer molecule movement parallel to surfaces when the surfaces are separated by a distance comparable to the size of the polymer molecule. This understanding is important in a variety of technological applications, such as hard drive lubrication and microelectronics manufacturing, and in biological processes within cells. For example, certain properties of polymers can be improved by mixing polymers with clay; this study will help explain how the polymer moves in spaces between individual clay particles during the mixing process. The overall result of this project will be a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that control polymer motion near and in-between surfaces which will improve design rules for new advanced materials and enhance the understanding of polymer physics. To complement the research, the outreach and educational component of this CAREER project is to revive and expand the interest of society and students at all levels in STEM careers, especially targeting those who represent diversity with respect to economic status, ethnicity and gender. The CAREER award will allow the PI to develop a Minority Teaching Fellows program that pairs graduate student colleagues with minority teachers from Title 1 high-schools to conduct cutting-edge research and develop new high-school curricula involving modern issues of polymeric materials. Through active participation, graduate students will also develop new appreciation for current issues of math, science and engineering education and societal viewpoints of careers in these disciplines. Additionally, to more broadly reach K-12 students, the PI and graduate student colleagues will develop Engineering Expeditions modules to be incorporated into Explore UT, an on campus day of performances, exhibits, lectures and hands-on activities. This event is free and involves a broad cross-section of the public and K-12 students from all over the State of Texas with whom the PI and graduate students will interact through hands-on demonstrations highlighting ""why plastics do what they do""."

It will link this linguistic data to an ethnographic account of Chachi constructions of race and ethnicity in Latin America, examining how social categories are produced and reproduced through social interaction. The primary research question asks how the resources of Cha'palaa grammar are activated in Chachi people's discourse about themselves and other social groups. Answering this question requires combining traditional long-term ethnographic research living in Chachi communities with the methodologies of descriptive linguistics, including new technologies such as digital recording and archiving and computer transcription and database programs. The primary data to be considered will be a broad, transcribed, translated and analyzed corpus of video recordings of natural discourse in Cha'palaa. This corpus will provide both rich data for linguistic description and a documentation of cultural knowledge, including traditions of storytelling, oral history, ecological knowledge, handcrafts, agriculture, political organization, and the ritual calendar. The corpus will be archived in several sites for safeguarding and future use by researchers and community members. <br/><br/>The dissertation will undertake an analysis of a special subset of this corpus, focusing on interviews and everyday conversation in which Chachi people discuss themselves relative to other social groups such as their Afro-Ecuadorian neighbors. The analysis will produce an ethnographic account of language situated in cultural context and a grammatical sketch of Cha'palaa that will later form the basis of a full grammar. Much of the data entry and analysis will be done with the help of native speaker consultants who receive support and training for college.

They are continuing to explore Type Ia supernovae with optical and near infrared spectroscopy and optical spectropolarimetry with the goal of better understanding the progenitor evolution, the explosion physics, and the capacity of these supernovae to facilitate accurate cosmological measurements. Evidence possibly related to the binary nature of these objects has started a new branch of supernovae research to determine when the photospheres of supernovae become spherical and to better understand the dispersion in luminosity and color between objects due to effects of asphericity near supernova maximum. They are exploring the nature of the collapse of the stellar core, specifically probing asymmetries in the explosion with spectropolarimetry. One key factor in determining the physical nature of core collapse supernovae is the geometry of portions of the ejecta of different composition. This is determined by careful spectropolarimetry. Dynamical models of core collapse that generate bipolar and more complex flows are being tested to determine the degree of fundamental asymmetry in the explosion necessary to imprint different polarization in different chemical layers of the ejecta. They participate in the use of the Robotic Optical Transient Source Experiment telescope array to study gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and their connection.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This work integrates research and education by advancing discovery and understanding, while at the same time educating graduate students and training postdoctoral researchers.

Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) promises to change modes of inquiry, research, and practice in earthquake engineering. When it becomes operational in October 2004, NEES will facilitate a major improvement in research by integrating experimental and computational simulation. Through unparalleled experimental, computational, and information technology resources, NEES has the potential to revolutionize the way that earthquake engineers conduct research and implement results into practice. This collaborative project involves eighteen researchers from ten universities. As such, it provides an ideal opportunity for demonstrating and challenging the new NEES model for conducting research and also addresses one of the most critical needs in earthquake engineering today: improved knowledge of soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFSI). The research plan involves four primary components: (1) four complementary experimental programs which will investigate key aspects of SFSI, (2) refinement of computational simulation models for SFSI, (3) management of the data and metadata generated in the investigation, and (4) outreach to the earthquake engineering community.<br/>Three of the four experimental programs will involve NEES Equipment Sites. The centrifuge tests will be<br/>conducted at the University of California, Davis, the shaking table tests will be conducted at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the field tests will use the mobile equipment from the University of Texas at Austin. Structural tests will also be conducted at Purdue University. The integration of computational and experimental simulation is a key feature of NEES, and the computational models will be used to design the test specimens, develop the testing protocols, and evaluate the measured response. An important deliverable of the project is improved computational models for SFSI, calibrated from the experiments, in a form available for community use. Other important features of NEES are the curated data repositories and a collaborative research environment. The project team includes researchers from the NEES System Integration Project (NCSA for data management and CREW for collaborative tools). The project team will thereby test the tools being developed by the System Integrator and contribute to the development of enhanced data and metadata models. In addition, the project team is committed to working with members of the earthquake engineering community during this research project. All design documents, simulation models, simulation results, material properties, and measured data will be available to the community via web-based tools. Many of the experiments will be webcast in real time, and video clips from all experiments will be available. An effort will be made to encourage members of the community to submit comments and suggestions to the research team based on the preliminary research plan and to develop separate proposals to complement the proposed plan. A series of prediction competitions are also<br/>planned to evaluate a variety of computational models. Two complete course modules for undergraduate courses will be developed based on the research. In addition, the project team will promote the project and discuss the results at appropriate meetings and conferences to generate interest and encourage participation among practicing engineers. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed research are extensive. By integrating the educational and research activities within the project, the team demonstrates a commitment to advancing discovery and understanding in earthquake engineering while promoting teaching, training, and learning at the undergraduate level. The research team is also committed to broadening participation of underrepresented groups. The research team comprises a diverse group of faculty with respect to technical expertise, educational philosophies, age, gender, and ethnicity. In addition, San Jose State University does not grant the PhD degree in civil engineering, therefore, these students will be exposed to opportunities not currently available at their host institution. The research team will also enhance the infrastructure for research and education by sharing all experimental, computational, and educational data developed as part of this<br/>proposal. This information will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding within the earthquake engineering community. The research team will also make a special effort to discuss the research results with engineers and decision makers in the state departments of transportation, thereby providing a mechanism for society to benefit from the results of the proposed research."

In contrast to being a one-size-fits-all solution, collaborative learning is highly dependent upon characteristics of the collaborators and on fine-grained interactions. The overarching research question of this project is: Can we identify and support the facets of collaborative dialogue that are particularly effective for fostering learning, sense of identity, motivation, and continued engagement for diverse computer science learners?<br/><br/>The project investigates this question in three activities. Firstly, a rich set of computer science collaborative learning data will be collected, leveraging the ASCEND learning environment, which supports remote collaboration with textual natural language dialogue, synchronized code editing, and integrated repository control for two or more collaborators. Data will be collected at three partnering institutions: North Carolina State University, Meredith College (an all-women's institution), and Florida A&M University (a minority-serving university with 90% African American enrollment), and will include student characteristics of gender, race/ethnicity, personality profile, and achievement goal orientation, as well as measures of outcomes such as learning, sense of computing identity, motivation, and engagement. Secondly, the project will examine the fine-grained facets of collaborative dialogue that are particularly effective for diverse computer science learners, in order to create fine-grained, theoretically informed models that capture collaborative dialogue and problem solving phenomena associated with learning, identity development, motivation, and engagement. Thirdly, the project will implement and evaluate evidence-based pedagogical support for fostering effective collaborative dialogue. <br/><br/>It is expected that the resulting pedagogical support will significantly improve learning, sense of identity, motivation, and continued engagement for students overall, and for women and African American students in particular. In addition, the project will produce fine-grained sequential analyses and rich qualitative findings that further the state of knowledge about how diverse students learn computing."

This approach includes: establishment of a Center for Advancing Multi-Cultural Perspectives on Science (CAMPOS), implementation of programs to reduce the impact of unconscious bias, empowerment of STEM women faculty, and a rigorous social science research and evaluation program that is designed to both inform and assess the innovative approach being utilized to create and sustain an inclusive STEM environment. Underlying this multi-faceted approach is a keen focus on the recruitment, retention and advancement of Latina STEM faculty and the development of a STEM workforce that more closely resembles the region. To that end, it is expected that this project will provide much-needed nuance to the understanding of how race, ethnicity and cultural differences interact with personal, familial, institutional, mentorship, and network influences to impact the attractiveness of the academic career path and the professional trajectories of Latina STEM faculty. Given the vast network of UC campuses and innovative dissemination methods, the ADVANCE program at UC Davis will seminally impact the region and other universities nationwide. As such, UC Davis will drive institutional change toward gender equity in numerous institutions of higher education, while promoting the career success of underrepresented STEM faculty and enhancing the potential of academic science through the inclusion of previously underrepresented perspectives."

Research has found variation in who accesses benefits and how they do so. Existing research suggests that the following factors could influence the variation in benefit claim among workers: 1) variation in satisfying eligibility criteria; 2) variation in viewing oneself as deserving of assistance; 3) difficulty navigating state systems; 4) variation in reticence to apply for assistance due to prior negative experiences with the law; and 5) employer practices. The current research uses a subsample of respondents drawn from the Michigan Recession and Recovery Study (a panel survey of a population-representative random sample drawn from the metro-Detroit region) who were unemployed in summer 2011. The subsample will be stratified to include respondents of diverse educational levels and ethnicity. Respondents will be interviewed about the circumstances of their job loss, their strategies for making ends meet, and their experiences with accessing assistance. This information, combined with data from the larger panel survey, will allow researchers to determine program eligibility and reasons for variation in ability to access assistance. <br/><br/>Analysis of these data will offer preliminary answers to the question of why some demographic groups of workers access benefit systems at lower rates than other demographic groups of workers. The research findings will be communicated with policy makers to inform decisionmaking about the structure of state bureaucratic programs."

While the profession has become much more diverse by gender and race, prestige and money also tend to be disproportionately allocated to white males. The result is a profession with major divisions in the settings within which lawyers work, the clients they represent, and the daily work with which they engage. Understanding who lawyers are, how lawyers make their careers, which lawyers attain elite positions, and whom lawyers serve are key issues both in terms of access to the profession and the way that the profession serves the ends of justice.<br/><br/>After the JD (AJD) is the first empirical study of a nationally representative cohort of new lawyers. AJD is tracking the professional lives of more than 4,500 lawyers who passed the bar in the year 2000. The sample was interviewed in 2003 and again in 2007 and will be interviewed by web, mail, and telephone surveys in 2012 (approximately twelve years into their careers). By year twelve, many respondents will have experienced important transitions in their personal and career trajectories, including the achievement of partnership in private law firms, attainment of supervisory positions in government or business, establishing a solo or small firm practice, or exit from law practice altogether. The study assesses the personal, professional, and contextual factors that lead to different career outcomes. It is particularly interested in examining the influence of gender, race, and ethnicity on career development. The timing of the third wave, which follows the global financial crisis that began in 2008, will also allow researchers to assess the effects of the economic collapse on the legal profession and individual lawyer careers."

Residents unincorporated the place in 1885, and it slowly disappeared from the landscape as people moved to the larger surrounding towns and distant urban areas. Today, the site is situated in a plowed field with only a few remaining fieldstone foundations. The goal of this research project is to understand how ethnicity and race may have influenced consumer choice, landscapes, and diet. This study will add a new perspective to understanding the changing relationships between whites and blacks in an integrated community over the course of antebellum and postbellum eras.<br/><br/>This REU Site will incorporate students in the research design, data collections, and analysis of the archaeological materials. The Site will accept 9 students for 10 weeks. The program is divided into three components: a one-week orientation and background session that includes the geophysical testing of archaeological sites; a four week archaeology field season collecting data; and a five week session at the Illinois State Museum scientifically analyzing material culture and archaeobiological data. Students will work in a collaborative effort while also receiving mentorship from an interdisciplinary team of professionals. Students will receive training in archaeological field methods, artifact identification, and cataloguing, as well as in faunal and macrofloral analyses.<br/><br/>This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences."

The present program of research investigates an overarching model of human judgments designed to address these questions. Essentially, the model asserts that to make impact the information given has to be subjectively relevant to the recipient. But this is not enough. It is incumbent that the recipient recognize the value and relevance of the information that is available. This, in turn, depends on the difficulty of discernment (i.e. the signal to noise ratio of the information) and on the individual's mental and motivational resources needed to overcome the difficulty. The model is tested in reference to a variety of classic judgmental problems identified by social and cognitive psychologists, including the neglect of statistical information, the formation of personality impressions, and the distortions of judgments in the direction of desired beliefs and outcomes. Beyond its interest value in illuminating a major problem in judgment and decision making, the present theory and the proposed research promise to effect a conceptual integration that identifies the critical commonalities shared by numerous separate models in this domain. More generally yet, the present perspective highlights the commonality in basic judgmental process across gender, ethnicity, culture, or age. It stresses that beyond undeniable superficial differences, people share a common humanity as far as their psychological processes are concerned. Understanding these commonalities may contribute to the improvement of communication among individuals and groups of diverse backgrounds."

These `schemata` are placed into novel contexts such as home, education, commerce as well as transferred between diverse work organizations. The researchers will study how this process occurs among people positioned differently throughout the Silicon Valley region. The differences stem from a variety of factors such as ethnicity, class, work or profession, gender and age. The study will investigate how technologies and economic structures and social organizations interact in peoples' daily lives. Through the analysis of a set of 450 interviews with 150 informants, the researchers will advance our understanding of how involvement with the new information technology industry is affecting the non-work lives of workers, and vice versa.

The proposal is grounded in three ideas: (1) that people's decisions are often ""mindless"" in that people make decisions unaware of their normative beliefs; (2) that becoming mindful of their normative beliefs brings people's decision processes into closer correspondence with those beliefs; and (3) that introspection can increase mindfulness and that introspection therefore increases the correspondence between normative beliefs and decision processes. Four sets of studies will be conducted, using laboratory and field experiments with student and non-student samples. The first set of studies will test whether introspection about the normative influence on decisions of emotional factors and objective scope (such as magnitude and probability) before making decisions causes people to weight emotion and scope in closer correspondence with their normative beliefs, typically decreasing the weight of emotional factors and increasing the weight of scope. The second set of studies will test whether asking people to introspect about the normative influence of personal preferences and social influence (such as political partisanship and peers' preferences) before making decisions causes people to weight personal preferences and social influence in closer correspondence with their normative beliefs, typically decreasing the weight of social influence and increasing the weight of personal preference. The third set of studies will examine moderators of these introspection effects, including differences in need for cognition, differences in normative beliefs, and the relative complexity of a decision. The final set of studies will examine implications of introspection for social decision making, including evaluations of others' personal decisions, evaluation of policy makers' decisions, and behavior in strategic social situations. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this research will provide scientific evidence for a simple introspection procedure that will advance understanding of whether and when people make decisions according to their personal beliefs. In so doing, the research will demonstrate a simple way to improve the quality of people's decisions in many domains, including charitable donations to alleviate humanitarian suffering, evaluation of environmental policy, perceptions of terrorist risks, personal financial decision making, consumer choices, and cooperative behavior in social contexts. This research will thus provide knowledge about a useful tool both for those interested in improving others' decisions (such as managers, marketers, and policy makers) and for those interested improving their personal decisions (such as employees, consumers, and citizens). This research will also clarify and extend a relatively new construct in Judgment and Decision Making that distinguishes between mindless versus mindful choice, providing an operationalization of those two states, and examining the mechanisms, boundary conditions, and beneficial consequences of moving from mindless to mindful choice. These studies will offer a simple, effective means of improving the quality of decisions without reliance on ""heavy handed"" external interventions that nudge people in a particular direction, going beyond interventions that rely on other people's ideas about the best and proper way to make decisions. There are also broader impacts inherent in the process of conducting this research, including the training and support of a group of undergraduate and PhD students that is diverse in sex and ethnicity, and the proposed research will foster international collaboration and training among, faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students in the United States and Germany."

Although research has examined the structural implications (economic, educational, healthcare, legal) of high profile judicial decisions for members of stigmatized social groups, very little work has studied the psychological consequences. Perhaps the most high profile social issue currently debated in the courts is whether marriage rights should extend to same-sex couples. This is a complex issue with heartfelt viewpoints expressed by people on both sides. The Supreme Court is currently considering the legality of same-sex marriage bans. This case promises to be a significant moment in American history regardless of the direction of the verdict. Given that many gay and lesbian individuals feel stigmatized by prohibitions against same-sex marriage, the current research is designed to examine the social psychological effects of this ruling (whichever way it turns out) on gay and lesbian individuals and a heterosexual comparison group. Drawing on social psychological theories of stigma and discrimination, a mediational model will be tested in which the court ruling may lead to changes in well-being by shifting individuals' perceptions of their stigmatized identity and subjective feelings of discrimination-related stress. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to our understanding of the effect of historic government-level decisions on health-relevant psychological processes of Americans. <br/><br/>To examine these questions, 1000 participants (500 self-identified gay and lesbian individuals and 500 heterosexual comparisons) will be recruited for a longitudinal study in which they complete a research survey prior to the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage, 2 months post-ruling, and 6 months post-ruling. Changes in psychological variables related to social attitudes and how participants experience their social identities will be examined, as well as the effects of these changes on psychological and physical well-being. This study will inform our understanding of the social psychological factors involved in people's responses to judicial decisions that are relevant to their standing in society. These results are likely to extend beyond this specific issue and provide a platform for understanding how other judicial decisions might have similar or different psychological consequences."

American youth are ill-prepared relative to their international counterparts - U.S. 15 year olds rank 16 out of 26 developed countries in science literacy and 19 out of 26 developed counties in mathematical literacy. There is much research in the areas of how students learn STEM in formal settings, but there is little knowledge of the impact of youth contexts on STEM. Youth contexts are social groups in the lives of young people such as neighborhoods, communities, schools, classrooms or friends. Understanding the role of youth contexts is crucial to ensuring that all students have the opportunity to learn STEM content. This project will synthesize the research literature on youth context and assess whether and how a range of these contexts shape K-12 STEM outcomes and engagement - predictors critical for later educational and occupational attainment. The researchers will conduct two large-scale meta-analyses - one based on the quantitative research body and one based on the qualitative research body - in order to draw conclusions about which contextual factors relate to which STEM outcomes across the span of extant research. In doing so, this synthesis project will inform educators and policymakers about the cumulative evidence that exists on the impacts of a variety of contextual factors on a multitude of STEM outcomes (e.g., math and science achievement, self-efficacy, future goals). This project will provide new evidence regarding the significance of youth contexts on STEM outcomes that will assist policy makers and educators in evaluating productive educational environments. <br/><br/>Syntheses of the research in youth contexts and their impact in STEM will address the following four research questions: (1) How do contextual factors impact STEM learning?; (2) How do these factors vary by the specific type of context?; (3) How do these factors vary by gender and race within each context?; and, (4) Are these factors influenced by the methodological features of the research? The review will include electronic searches of educational, economics, sociology, psychology, and general science databases covering the years 1980-2014. Results will be narrowed by youth context area, and separate analysis will be conducted on gender and race/ethnicity differences in STEM outcomes. The data for the full review will be evaluated by a common set of guidelines to be published along with the findings, enabling the conclusions of the review to be transparent and allowing for detailed information to be easily accessible. The review will discuss each study that meets the inclusion requirements for a valid research design. With this methodology, this study will be the first to provide a clearinghouse of rigorous research related to contextual factors of STEM outcomes"

The devastating floods in Eastern Iowa in June 2008 provide an opportunity to assess the effects of students' flood experiences on their subsequent educational development and careers. The investigators had previously been working under contract to the Cedar Rapids Community School District to develop a model of the changing geographical patterns of students attending its schools for the purpose of reorganizing their school attendance policies and areas served. When unexpected flooding from the Cedar River that was 11 feet (3.3 m) higher than in any previously recorded flood event in the area submerged some residences not even included in the 500-year flood maps for the city, tens of thousands of residents were displaced. Based on previously collected data, the investigators were able to determine that 1,834 students lived in neighborhoods that encountered flooding. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will enable these investigators to conduct research that is grounded in social scientific theories of educational performance and disaster aftermath that focus on disrupted and reconstituted network ties as key components of successful recovery. The investigators will conduct a longitudinal survey of fourth-grade through eighth-grade grade student families in the flood zone (676 students from approximately 420 families) and track students and families who remain in the larger Cedar Rapids community and those who left it. Affected students will be paired with a control group of non-flood affected students of similar race and ethnicity, family income status, grade in school, and school attended in 2008-2009 in an attempt to assess the distinctive effects of flood victimization on family life and educational performance.<br/><br/>This project will systematically assess the longitudinal effects of a natural disaster on the educational performance of youth using and integrating prevailing social scientific theories of educational development and community responses to disaster. Project results should permit comparisons to be made with research conducted in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the more limited research program of those who studied the aftermath of the 1997 flood in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The data from this project should allow the larger research community to engage in more sophisticated analyses of natural disaster impacts on youth and families, because flood-affected students and families will be systematically compared with similar control groups of students and families unaffected by the flood. Enhanced understanding of community and individual responses to disasters like the Cedar Rapids flood will be increasingly valuable for policy makers, planners, and other community leaders as they try to prepare for major catastrophes."

In recent decades the U.S. government has focused a good deal of attention on increasing the presence of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. The science and technology labor force has already diversified in important ways over the past few decades. Women's representation in science and technology education and employment has increased significantly, though their representation remains considerably smaller in fields such as engineering and computer science. This research explores whether the particular components of the STEM labor force - such as the representation of women in particular fields, or the share of coworkers of a particularly nativity or race - are associated with retention in the STEM work force or the gender wage gap. In fields where women account for a larger representation of STEM workers, for example, is the gender wage gap narrower? How is that relationship influenced by the group size of foreign-born workers, and does it matter whether these workers received their education and training in the United States or abroad?<br/><br/>There are several social scientific views that can be evoked in seeking to account for the dynamics involved in occupational sex composition and occupational wage rates. These perspectives are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but each focuses on distinct ways in which employers may exhibit preferences by gender or ethnicity. Our project will utilize Queuing theory and Devaluation theory to explore how the changing composition of the STEM labor force promotes (or retards) the retention and earnings of women in STEM. Such an approach will enable us to move beyond a simple gender dichotomy (men/women) to assess variation within gender (native-born/foreign-born). Data come from pooling six waves of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), covering years from 1995 through 2008. SESTAT is comprised of three ongoing surveys designed to create a nationally representative sample of science and engineering college degree holders (Kannankutty & Wilkinson, 1999). The restricted SESTAT data include detailed information regarding labor force participation, occupation categories, educational attainment, and demographic characteristics. The proposed project will include three sets of analyses, including descriptive analyses establishing trends in STEM employment by gender and nativity, as well a time since degree; multivariate logistic regression models incorporating predictors of employment in a STEM profession, by sex, and how group representation of the foreign-born moderates these associations; and OLS regression of women's and men's logged wages on observable characteristics."

Therefore, this project aims to (1) identify why veterans pursue bachelor's degrees in engineering, (2) illustrate veteran experiences in engineering education, and (3) advance knowledge on how academic institutions can further support veterans in engineering. This comparative case study of student veterans in engineering across four academic institutions will include interviews of student veterans and key stakeholders, as well as a content analysis of materials and websites related to student veteran issues and concerns.

Broadening the participation of veterans in engineering offers the potential to enhance diversity in engineering across multiple dimensions since, compared to civilian students, veterans are more likely to be older, first-generation college, disabled, African-American, or Latino. The study results will provide context and information for various applications, such as: development of new strategies to support student veterans' success, identification of overlooked areas to promote student veterans' participation in engineering, and generation of critical information for development of larger-scale studies for investigating student veterans in engineering. A comprehensive dissemination plan ensures that the study results, particularly the best practices for supporting veterans in engineering, reach diverse audiences interested in student veterans and engineering education.

Although violations of rights by the state may be rampant, citizens are reluctant to challenge the state, fearing they might be targeted for persecution. Lawyers tend to be similarly cowed. This project asks whether this might be changing. Focusing on the case of Russia, the project explores how lawyers think about themselves and their role in society through a random sample of 2500 recent law graduates. Russia presents an intriguing case because the number of young people studying law exploded just as the Putin regime stepped up its curtailment of the exercise of civil rights. The survey will reveal how graduates are dispersing themselves among various types of lawyering and their attitudes towards their obligations toward clients, with particular attention to the responsibility of lawyers to support clients who want to challenge the state or other powerful actors. The results promise to provide a window into the capacity of the Russian legal profession to spur the development of civil society. The results of the survey, which will be the first to include all types of Russian lawyers, will be archived and available to other researchers for analysis. <br/><br/>The project uses mixed methods to map the Russian legal profession and investigate its political significance. The fractured nature of this group makes a survey of practicing lawyers impossible. The Principal Investigator, working in collaboration with Russian consultants based at the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, plans a panel survey of a single cohort of law school graduates. They will construct a sample of approximately 2500 law students (recipients of both bachelors and masters degrees) on the cusp of graduation in 2016, stratified by region and institutional prestige. The PI plans to return to this same group of respondents at regular 5-year intervals (though this proposal seeks funding for the first round). Among the questions that the PI will be able to answer are: how do graduates disperse among the various subgroups of the profession; and to what extent are some demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, ethnicity, religion, class) preferenced by the different subgroups of the profession in getting a job and moving up the ladder of success. As a supplement to the survey, the PI will conduct 120 follow-up interviews with respondents culled from the surveyed population with an eye to diversity in career path as well as demographic factors. These interviews will build on the survey and will be conducted in 2017. They will be concentrated in 3 regions: Moscow, Saratov, and Tomsk. The interviews will be transcribed and analyzed by the PI using NVIVO. As with the survey, future plans call for re-interviewing this same cohort of 120 respondents at regular intervals."

The current emphasis on decentralization increases the importance of local governments and local elites. Yet, within a country, the performance of local governments may vary dramatically. Existing theories tend to focus on social and cultural explanations of variation in performance. Yet, these explanations fall short when one attempts to understand the ability of recent decentralization schemes to achieve stated goals. Many of the countries moving toward greater decentralization are found in parts of the world where patronage and clientelism remain crucial in deterring political outcomes. In neo-patrimonial societies, one cannot assume that decentralization policies are implemented completely, meet all stated objectives, and remain insulated from previously existing patterns of political rule. This project examines whether decentralization improves local government performance, and it suggests that the nature of local politics explains observed differences in performance across administrative units.<br/> In analyzing local politics, it is important to acknowledge the prevalence of clientelist or neo-patrimonial politics in Africa and throughout the developing world. The artificiality of national boundaries and the external imposition of state structures in most African countries explain the fact that national identities and feelings of community at the national level are relatively undeveloped. Consequently, the line between public and private is blurred by clientelism as politicians are forced to exchange material benefits for political support. Similarly, neo-patrimonialism refers to situations in which the line between public and private is shattered completely. According to Clapham (1982), public politics refer to situations in which political actors pursue the goals of the state, whereas private politics describe instances in which individuals or groups pursue their own well-being rather than promoting the general public welfare.<br/> This project examines the relationship among decentralization, institutional performance, and local politics in a sample of Uganda's administrative districts. Districts are sampled purposively to reflect diversity in several important characteristics They include region, ethnicity, date when the district was decentralized, and distance from the capital city. Local political institutions are expected to perform better in districts where politics is described best as public but worse in districts where private politics dominate. This type of research requires a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data and, thus, several data collection methods are used. These methods include archival research, participant observation, elite interviewing, and survey research."

Autor, MIT and NBER<br/>Gordon H. Hanson, UCSD and NBER<br/><br/>Abstract. Economic theory suggest that by allowing countries to specialize according to their comparative advantage international trade gives consumers access to a greater variety of products, raising their real incomes. Realizing these gains often brings about substantial changes in national industry structure, as workers move out of import-competing sectors and into other activities. The public debate about globalization tends to center less on the long-run benefits of trade and more on the short-run costs of workers, firms, and industries from adjusting to import competition. Characterizing the adjustment costs associated with trade is therefore important for framing the policy discussion about global economic integration.<br/><br/>This project examines the impact of exposure to import competition on the employment and earnings trajectories of U.S. workers over the long term. The focus is on growth in U.S. imports from China, though imports from other low-wage countries are also considered. To measure worker outcomes, the project makes use of individual-level data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) over the period 1978 to 2007. The SSA data contain a complete history of a worker's annual earnings by employer and by industry, as well as information on receipts of Social Security benefits. These data make it possible to estimate how exposure to import competition affects worker employment, earnings, and benefits uptake by firm and by sector and how these outcomes vary according to a worker's demographic characteristics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, foreign-born status), skill level, and employer characteristics. Administrative data have been used extensively in the analysis of the impact of job loss on worker incomes, but they have been underutilized in considering the consequences of U.S. trade. The project will thus provide evidence on long-run adjustment to trade among U.S. workers than is missing in the literature.<br/><br/>Motivating the focus on China is the country's spectacular economic growth, particularly in manufacturing. Since the early 1990s, Chinas has accounted for nearly three quarters of the growth in manufacturing value added by low and middle income countries. For the United States, China's impact is compounded by a profound imbalance in the two countries' aggregate exports and imports. China runs a large trade surplus, whereas the U.S. runs a large trade deficit. U.S. industries exposed to the increase in China's trade capacity have consequently faced a major expansion in global competition on the supply side, without an offsetting expansion in consumer spending for their products on the demand side. China's export growth appears to be largely attributable to its remarkable improvements in domestic industrial productivity arising from the dismantling of state control and the liberalization of restrictions on trade and investment. <br/><br/>The project unites two disparate bodies of knowledge. One, on how international trade affects labor markets, examines how changes in import competition alter wages and employment in the short or medium run by studying these changes in impacted firms, industries, or regions. While this approach uncovers the temporary effects of greater import competition, it misses impacts on workers that persist after an individual leaves his firm, abandons his industry, or relocates to another city or state. By utilizing long-run data on individual workers available in the SSA data, the project captures how increased trade with China changes earnings and uptake of Social Security benefits that workers experience while employed at their initial firm, after they move to a new firm in the same industry, after they shift to a new industry altogether, and after they exit from employment entirely. Decomposing the long-run change in earnings into these four components shows where in the transition process workers face the most significant adjustment costs, results that will help guide future theoretical work on trade and labor markets. The second body of related literature tracks the earnings of workers who are displaced from their jobs. Because job loss that is involuntary is difficult to identify in available data, much research uses administrative records to isolate extreme cases of displacement, such as mass layoffs associated with plant closures or substantial downsizings. The literature shows that job loss due to mass layoffs has significant negative long-run effects on worker earnings. By using administrative data, the project, like the earlier displaced-worker literature, captures the long-run effects of changes in labor-market conditions. By focusing on a specific type of change, namely one related to greater import competition from China, the project examines all types of job loss related to trade and not just those associated with mass layoffs."

It also provides teacher training and curriculum revisions and leverages industry partnerships to create new opportunities for students. The student body at the college is very diverse, being composed of 86% underrepresented students. Conversely, IT programs at the college are much less diverse than the general student population, in fact the programs are remarkable for their lack of diversity in terms of ethnicity and gender. Because the college has a history of recruiting, supporting, and graduating students from underrepresented groups, once it is determined why so few students are entering IT career programs, outreach efforts are being modified to recruit underrepresented students into IT programs, and additional support mechanisms are being developed to improve the chances of students of successfully completing their program.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: A hallmark of this project is the degree to which it builds on existing initiatives and partnerships. From design to implementation, from evaluation to dissemination, this project builds on the work of other ATE projects and centers. Significant support from business and secondary school partners is creating a collaborative project team. Industry partners are committed to providing resources to facilitate effective and cost efficient communication; to sponsor and participate in career awareness events; to provide access to modern instrumentation and new technologies presently unavailable to many students; to help integrate current industry standards and 21st century workplace competencies into the curriculum; to provide speakers and facilitate information sessions designed to engage underrepresented students; and to facilitate field trips and industry tours. This project is improving student learning by providing secondary school teacher training; leveraging business partnerships to provide students with 21st century workplace experiences and cutting-edge instrumentation; and by aligning curricula with industry standards. This project is designed to be institutionalized upon completion of the proposed activities. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: At the core of this project is the promotion of a diverse technical workforce capable of addressing significant IT workforce needs. This project fosters and builds upon collaborative relationships to achieve the goal of diversity, and the results of the project are likely to be widely adaptable at other institutions.

Three institutions join efforts for this purpose: University of Colorado at Boulder, University of Colorado at Denver, and University of Washington. FA, in the context of the study, is viewed as a process contributing to the science learning of ELLs, as opposed to the administration of discrete sets of instruments to collect data from students. The study targets Spanish-speaking, elementary and middle school students. Findings from this study contribute to advance knowledge and understanding of FA as an inherent component of the science learning process in linguistically diverse classrooms, and to define a research agenda aimed at enhancing science teachers' ability to enact equitable and effective assessment practices for this student subpopulation. <br/><br/>Three research questions guide the work: (1) What FA practices are occurring in science classrooms that serve predominantly mainstream students and in those serving predominantly ELLs?; (2) How are teachers' FA practices for mainstream students different from or similar to those used with ELLs?; and (3) How do contextual factors and teachers' cultural and linguistic competencies influence FA practices? To address these questions, two conceptual frameworks are used--one for characterizing FA events; the other for examining FA events as a communication process. The study employs a mixed-methods research approach with emphasis on case studies. The sample size consists of three school districts in Colorado and Washington, 16 classrooms (8 elementary, 8 middle school), 16 teachers, and 96 ELLs. Classrooms are selected to represent a particular combination of four factors: (a) teacher ethnicity, (b) teacher formal academic preparation in teaching ELLs, (c) type of linguistic student background, and (d) grade level. Students are selected through a stratified random sample, identified by achievement level (i.e., low, medium, high), and linguistic background (i.e., mainstream, ELL). Data collection strategies to document the implementation of FA at the beginning, during, and at the end of a science unit include: (a) classroom observations, (b) classroom video-recording, (c) video/artifact simulated recall, (d) assessment of artifacts, (e) student interviews, (f) teacher questionnaires, (g) teacher interviews, (h) school principal interviews, and (i) school observations. Reliability and validity of most of the data-gathering instruments is determined through pilot studies. Data interpretation strategies include: (a) coding based on the two conceptual frameworks, (b) scoring rubrics to identify levels of effectiveness, and (c) narratives and profiles to describe FA patterns. Publications and the development of a website constitute the main dissemination strategies. A technical advisory board is responsible for formative and summative evaluation. Key evaluation questions are: (1) To what extent does the project enhance research on ELL FA practices through case studies?, and (2) How effectively do the project dissemination activities facilitate understanding of FA practices? <br/><br/>Major project outcomes include: (1) a description of the patterns of formal and informal FA practices for ELLs; (2) a comparison of the FA practices observed in classrooms that vary on the dimensions of teacher characteristics and linguistic diversity; and (3) an empirically and theoretically informed set of findings and strategies for supporting teachers to enact and enhance FA practices sensitive to cultural and linguistic diversity. Three main products are developed: (1) a monograph describing the FA practices observed across the different classrooms with concrete examples; (2) a description of possible professional development strategies to improve in-service FA practices for linguistically diverse students; and (3) a research-informed approach for analyzing FA practices. Besides filling the existing research gap on FA with ELLs, outcomes and products serve as a foundation for a future research agenda and a comprehensive project aimed at ensuring equitable science learning for all students, including ELLs."

The project studies the long-standing problem in public good provision: individual contributions benefit many people, but contributors do not receive payment or recompense for the total impact of their work. This project considers social interactions and social incentives in public good provision. Communities, neighborhoods, ethnicity, and kin have all been argued to be central to the provision of public goods. The project draws heavily on these empirical findings. It formalizes social networks and social identity, and integrates them into mathematical models of decision-making. By developing a network theory of public goods and social interactions, the project both advances basic science and provides a guide to new directions for empirical research and policy.<br/><br/>Public goods are vital to a productive workforce and sustainable economic growth. Industrial research and development, health, security, and environmental preservation are just some examples of public goods. In its scientific mission, this project will advance understanding of how actual and virtual communities and governmental agencies help or hinder the provision of public goods. The project combines new economic techniques and computer science techniques to understand how networks of people can contribute to economic growth. In its education mission, the project will promote and advance the participation and education of women in two scientific fields - computer science and economic science - where women are significantly underrepresented. The project will develop courses and run workshops to train students in a set of tools for studying networks and strategic games. In its personnel and subject matter, the project follows national panel recommendations to increase the participation of women in science by providing role models and fostering research with social objectives."

Categorical variables that summarize this type of survey data are called multiple response (or pick any/c) categorical variables. It is often of interest to test for independence between two categorical variables. When categorical variables can have multiple responses, traditional Pearson chi-square tests for independence should not be used because of the within-subject dependence among responses. This research will provide methods to test for independence between two or more multiple-response categorical variables. A modified version of the Pearson statistic will perform the test, and bootstrap procedures will provide approximate sampling distributions. First and second-order corrections will allow for chi-square distribution approximations to the sampling distribution. Generalized log linear models and multivariate binomial logit-normal models will provide a model-based approach for the test of independence. <br/><br/>Many survey questions are asked in a multiple-response manner. Examples include: ""What types of cars do you own?"" and ""For what criminal offenses have you been arrested?"" Other questions naturally fall into a multiple-response format, but some researchers avoid asking them in this format due to statistical analysis problems. For example, most survey questions dealing with ethnicity allow respondents to make only one choice, which is entirely inappropriate in today's highly multicultural population. Other researchers may analyze multiple-response questions as if they came from single-response categorical variables, which can lead to very conservative tests of independence. This research will allow researchers to incorporate these types of questions into surveys and use statistically correct methods of analysis. The research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies under the Research on Survey and Statistical Methodology Funding Opportunity."

Technical education prepares children for productive lives as adults, and the adults providing it expect to teach boys how to become men and to teach girls how to become women. Some children will learn to become good factory workers, while others will become good engineers. Studying technical education allows us to examine the ways work and technology are related to ideas about gender, ethnicity and social class. Technical education, defined broadly, includes teaching juvenile delinquents how to sew as well as teaching promising young apprentices how to make mechanical drawings. But such opportunities were provided selectively, based on educators' expectations about what children would be doing as adults. Careful study of reports, managers' minutes, and curricula allows the PI to develop evidence about what children learned and how it was justified. For example, in the public schools of the 1880s and 1809s, when arguments for curricular change were often couched in language about democracy and opportunity, some children-middle-class high-school boys-were taught to understand science and theory and design, while other children-recent immigrants, expected to work in factories by age 14-were taught to copy an object chosen by their teacher, with an emphasis on neatness and obedience. Girls' training, even when it led to paid work in industrial textile design, was described in terms of women's domestic talents."

African American and Caucasian signers are represented equally. Sociolinguistic variation is variation that shows a correlation between linguistic items (sounds, handshapes, words, grammatical constructions) and social factors such as age, ethnicity, gender, region, and socioeconomic class. Studies of sociolinguistic variation are important because they inform our understanding of the fundamental nature of language and of how languages change. This project will focus on variation in a signed language and hence will allow us to begin to see what kinds of variation characterize all kinds of human languages and what kinds of variation are modality-specific, i.e. characteristic exclusively of spoken languages or signed languages. The focus will be on target variables including 1-handshape signs, signs produced on the side of the forehead, and variable pronouns. All of these variables occur in large enough numbers to allow for the same kind of statistical analyses that have been used for spoken language variation. Lexical variation in the data will also be analyzed. The result will be a comprehensive description of sociolinguistic variation in ASL, along with a quantitative analysis of specific variables. A corollary goal of the project is the preparation of a videotape and manual about sociolinguistic variation for use by the deaf community at large: for children, teachers, parents, and community members."

On the one hand, science research is seen as an economic driver for the communities where it is produced. The successes of Silicon Valley in Northern California, the Route 128 corridor around Boston MA, the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, and the clusters of small tech startups in Austin TX are often attributed to the scientific research produced in these communities. On the other hand, science is often viewed as being primarily ""ivory tower,"" with limited practical value. A quantitative understanding of the economic spillovers from science is critical for policy makers from the state and local levels to the national level seeking to set science-funding levels. Despite this policy interest, there is surprisingly little work quantifying the economic benefits of science. This project provides such estimates, showing what results we should expect from science and research spending in cities across the nation. <br/><br/>In addition to leading directly to valuable inventions, scientific activity is believed to raise productivity in the communities where it is performed. This project focuses on these productivity spillovers. Our understanding of these economic spillovers from science is not very good yet, at least in part because there are three significant challenges to estimating the spillover benefits of science. Specifically: <br/><br/>(1) Cities like Boston and San Francisco, where a large amount of research is performed, may be inherently different from cities with a small amount of research. Such differences are likely to lead researchers to misstate the spillover benefits from science, attributing to ""science in the city"" what is really attributable to the city itself. <br/><br/>(2) The typical person living in a city with a lot of scientific activity may be more productive than the typical person in other cities. For instance, a large amount of science is produced by universities, which clearly generate skills for their students and may attract highly productive workers. Such differences would tend to lead researchers to overstate the spillover benefits of science. <br/><br/>(3) If research raises productivity in a city, it would be natural to expect workers to move to that city and for the city to expand. An inflow of workers to cities with more scientific activity but not more jobs will depress wages, however, leading researchers to understate the spillovers from science. <br/><br/>This project includes all of these effects in estimating the economic spillovers from science. We relate wages, real-estate prices, and other important economic outcomes in a city to measures of scientific activity there. We exploit a wide range of strategies to address all three of the challenges that have frustrated previous research, including developing a general framework in which they can be addressed. We will also produce rich data on scientific activity that will be available for future research. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>These estimates will help policymakers value the economic benefits generated by science to fine-tune science investments. The project will specifically determine how scientific activity affects underrepresented groups based on gender, race, ethnicity, and age. The strategy developed under this project can also be applied to estimate the benefits of science stimulus spending and evaluate which expenditures produced the most benefits."

If the frontiers of knowledge in Pittsburgh's biotechnology research and development community are to be advanced and scientific breakthroughs are to occur, trained biotechnicians must be available to meet the demand. The aim of the Biotechnology Workforce Collaborative (BWC) is to widen the spectrum of available, skilled workers in the region by enhancing ongoing partnerships with local stakeholders to a burgeoning program for the training of biotechnology/life sciences laboratory technicians. <br/><br/>The objectives and methods include: <br/>(a) Academic training at the college resulting in the associate degree.<br/>(b) A laboratory internship in the laboratories of Allegheny General Hospital, Allegheny Singer Research Institute (ASRI), the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative (PTEI); and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine.<br/>(c) Career development support for individual students starting at the early stages of participant preparation for college work and continuing in assistance for those students upon employment at various research laboratories. <br/>(d) Workgroup meetings to further develop and refine the training approach for laboratory technicians. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Recruitment efforts focus on developing three staggered cohorts of students. Both academic and employment criteria used in the field are being applied to the selection of promising candidates. Economically and educationally disadvantaged students are being supported by the project that integrates the associate degree for biotechnology technician with the workforce needs of research laboratories that specialize in molecular genetics, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and innovation in the application of research results for health care. The collaborative effort includes an internship and long term support for career development of biotechnology/life sciences laboratory technicians. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Based on gender, ethnicity, and geography, the cohorts broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the biotechnology field, predominantly serving the biological sciences. As the BWC continues to become a major player in the Pittsburgh region, this project has an important role in advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning between the academic and industry partners. It enhances the infrastructure for research and education as a feeder to meet employment needs and as a critical link to industry."

Ten undergraduate students will participate each summer in individual projects over the course of 10 weeks. A group of 9 faculty members in the College of Engineering and Architecture at WSU will be dedicated to mentoring and research supervision. Each project will introduce the student to basic concepts in multiscale engineering and, thus, each project will include components (experimental and/or analytical and numerical) that deal with at least two different length scales. Students will work with a team including faculty, post docs and graduate students on projects such as multiscale models of materials behavior, discrete particle simulation of granular materials, collective behavior of carbon nanotubes, mechanical behavior of sheet metals under dynamic loading, modeling and simulation of microfluidic fuel cells, thermoacoustic electricity generators, scaling of hydrogenic twin-screw extruders for the fueling of fusion energy machines, fabrication and characterization of thermal interface materials, scaling issues in resonant heat engines, and multiscale effects in composite laminates.<br/><br/>This REU Site program will provide a research experience for a diverse group of students, ranging from ethnicity, gender, academic, and economic backgrounds. Recruitment efforts will focus on students from demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering and science, students from schools that have limited research, and students who are 1st and 2nd year undergraduates who are often not given research opportunities. The goal for this REU site is to increase participation by underrepresented groups from the current 45% to over 50%. In particular, the program will increase participation by Hispanic students through mentoring programs. By actively recruiting students who have finished their first and second years, the program aims to attract students to engineering who otherwise might have changed majors later in their undergraduate studies. This strategy is designed to attract and retain students from many disciplines of engineering and science to careers in multiscale science and engineering."

The University of California-Berkeley (UC Berkeley) program will: (1) build on its current and expanding Cal Teach program which supports undergraduate students as they pursue their STEM disciplinary degrees along with credentials in teaching mathematics and science, particularly in urban schools; (2) leverage a new collaboration with the University of California-Merced (UC Merced) to offer education courses and activities for STEM undergraduates at both campuses and a secondary teaching credential in mathematics or science at UC Berkeley; and (3) enhance the overall efforts and activities through strong extant partnerships with local school districts (Berkeley, Oakland Unified, and Merced City) and with local research and outreach institutions (e.g., Lawrence Hall of Science and the Chabot Space and Science Center). The project will support a total of more than one-hundred (100) students by providing (a) internships to twelve (12) lower division undergraduate students per year to engage these students in research, professional development, and interactions with outreach partners, and (b) scholarships to nine (9) upper division students per year who are participants in the Cal Teach program. These scholarship awards will be highly visible within the STEM disciplines at UC Berkeley and UC Merced, and will be identified as awards which reflect student accomplishment and success. <br/><br/>This Noyce Phase 2 project will be an integrated program, with early and frequent field placements, allowing aspiring teachers to develop both deep subject matter understanding and exemplary pedagogical skills as they engage in both theory and practice. To accomplish this, the project will engage faculty from the STEM content areas as well as from the Graduate School of Education at UC Berkeley through an interdisciplinary approach to teacher preparation that has been shown to be critical in the context of training mathematics and science teachers for urban schools. In the process of project implementation, the project team will investigate the following questions: (i) What are the key activities which generate successful recruiting and retention of STEM major candidates with diverse backgrounds--including gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status--compared to entering teacher candidates for the state and national teacher workforce? (ii) How do teacher candidates, their university supervisors, and, once they begin a teaching position, their administrators, perceive the quality of their preparation for a teaching career in urban schools? What gaps and other issues need to be addressed in their preparation? (iii) What is the nature of classroom practices for these teachers? What is the impact on their K-12 students' learning? and (iv) What is the long term retention rate of these teachers? To what extent do these teachers assume a leadership role in their schools/districts? Research related to the key factors behind answers to above questions will lead to a national model for success in STEM teaching in urban settings that will also stimulate broadening participation in STEM and promoting social justice through mathematics and science teaching and learning."

To meet the need for ambitious mathematics instruction, a more robust research base is needed regarding how to support beginning teachers in enacting such instruction. To that end, this NSF EHR Core Research Level II study will investigate how teacher preparation programs support elementary candidates in developing ambitious mathematics instruction and factors that are associated with how graduates of these programs enact mathematics instruction as first- and second-year teachers. Cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) in a mixed-methods research design will be applied to examine how elementary candidates' characteristics (i.e., their teaching identity, beliefs, and knowledge with regard to teaching mathematics) interact with their opportunities to learn (OTL) in mathematics methods courses and student teaching experiences to influence their enactment of ambitious mathematics instruction as first- and second-year teachers. The study will also explore how novice teachers' characteristics interact with resources and expectations in their schools to influence their mathematics instruction as teachers of record. The study results will inform the design of university-based teacher preparation programs, including the selection of elementary candidates with particular characteristics, the content of mathematics methods courses, and desirable characteristics of student teaching assignments. This work is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.<br/><br/>This study will feature surveys of 150 elementary candidates from a purposively sampled set of six teacher preparation programs in three states during their final year of preparation and their first two years of teaching. The Mathematics Scan (M-Scan) classroom observation instrument will be used to observe these graduates multiple times as they teach mathematics as first- and second-year teachers. M-Scan measures ambitious mathematics instruction by assessing teachers' use of mathematical tasks, discourse, representations, and coherence. In addition, this study will feature interviews with elementary preparation program directors and mathematics methods instructors at each university; and it will feature surveys of teacher educators, practicing teachers, mathematics instructional coaches, and principals who work with the novice teacher study participants. The study's primary outcome is to measure novices' enactment of ambitious mathematics instruction by using the four M-Scan constructs: mathematical tasks, discourse, representations, and coherence. Each construct represents its own dependent variable. Multiple regression will be used to study the main outcome as a function of several independent variables (including individual teacher characteristics, OTL in mathematics methods courses and student teaching, and resources and expectations in novice teachers' schools) and interactions among these variables. All models will include a vector of controls for teacher attributes (e.g., the teacher's ACT/SAT score, selectivity of undergraduate institution, undergraduate grade point average) and school attributes (e.g., student race/ethnicity, student eligibility for free/reduced lunch, school size, urbanicity, curriculum policy, professional development offerings). This project will contribute to building the knowledge base for designing high-quality teacher preparation and induction programs that support elementary candidates and novice teachers with a range of background experiences, beliefs, and knowledge. This includes understanding factors that inhibit or promote the development of ambitious mathematics instruction to ensure that new elementary teachers are able to provide all students with instruction that supports their deep conceptual understanding of mathematical content."

Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) promises to change modes of inquiry, research, and practice in earthquake engineering. When it becomes operational in October 2004, NEES will facilitate a major improvement in research by integrating experimental and computational simulation. Through unparalleled experimental, computational, and information technology resources, NEES has the potential to revolutionize the way that earthquake engineers conduct research and implement results into practice. This collaborative project involves eighteen researchers from ten universities. As such, it provides an ideal opportunity for demonstrating and challenging the new NEES model for conducting research and also addresses one of the most critical needs in earthquake engineering today: improved knowledge of soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFSI). The research plan involves four primary components: (1) four complementary experimental programs which will investigate key aspects of SFSI, (2) refinement of computational simulation models for SFSI, (3) management of the data and metadata generated in the investigation, and (4) outreach to the earthquake engineering community.<br/>Three of the four experimental programs will involve NEES Equipment Sites. The centrifuge tests will be<br/>conducted at the University of California, Davis, the shaking table tests will be conducted at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the field tests will use the mobile equipment from the University of Texas at Austin. Structural tests will also be conducted at Purdue University. The integration of computational and experimental simulation is a key feature of NEES, and the computational models will be used to design the test specimens, develop the testing protocols, and evaluate the measured response. An important deliverable of the project is improved computational models for SFSI, calibrated from the experiments, in a form available for community use. Other important features of NEES are the curated data repositories and a collaborative research environment. The project team includes researchers from the NEES System Integration Project (NCSA for data management and CREW for collaborative tools). The project team will thereby test the tools being developed by the System Integrator and contribute to the development of enhanced data and metadata models. In addition, the project team is committed to working with members of the earthquake engineering community during this research project. All design documents, simulation models, simulation results, material properties, and measured data will be available to the community via web-based tools. Many of the experiments will be webcast in real time, and video clips from all experiments will be available. An effort will be made to encourage members of the community to submit comments and suggestions to the research team based on the preliminary research plan and to develop separate proposals to complement the proposed plan. A series of prediction competitions are also<br/>planned to evaluate a variety of computational models. Two complete course modules for undergraduate courses will be developed based on the research. In addition, the project team will promote the project and discuss the results at appropriate meetings and conferences to generate interest and encourage participation among practicing engineers. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed research are extensive. By integrating the educational and research activities within the project, the team demonstrates a commitment to advancing discovery and understanding in earthquake engineering while promoting teaching, training, and learning at the undergraduate level. The research team is also committed to broadening participation of underrepresented groups. The research team comprises a diverse group of faculty with respect to technical expertise, educational philosophies, age, gender, and ethnicity. In addition, San Jose State University does not grant the PhD degree in civil engineering, therefore, these students will be exposed to opportunities not currently available at their host institution. The research team will also enhance the infrastructure for research and education by sharing all experimental, computational, and educational data developed as part of this<br/>proposal. This information will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding within the earthquake engineering community. The research team will also make a special effort to discuss the research results with engineers and decision makers in the state departments of transportation, thereby providing a mechanism for society to benefit from the results of the proposed research."

Yet, the United States' need for a larger and more diverse scientific and technological labor force continues to grow. Increasing the number and diversity of students pursuing engineering degrees is an important strategy to help meet the nation's workforce demands. The objective of this research project is to examine students' pathways from high school through college to determine high school level factors that predict college engineering degree attainment. Examining the role of high schools is especially critical because pre-college academic preparation is a key contributor to college academic success, and because many students tend to decide to pursue an engineering degree before applying to colleges. The results of this research have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of students' college preparation, major choice, and likelihood of graduating with an engineering degree. Key stakeholders can apply findings from this research to inform strategies and refocus educational interventions to increase female and minority students' participation in engineering. <br/><br/>This research project applies an institutional perspective to identify high school structural factors that play a role in the longitudinal patterns of academic engineering achievement among students, with a focus on variation across gender and race/ethnicity. The high school structural factors to be examined include: the availability of math and science courses and an engineering-inspired curriculum, proximity to colleges with engineering programs, demographic composition and characteristics of the student body, and access to information about postsecondary education attendance and likelihood of success (e.g., student college-going rates). The research team will apply econometric methods, including regression and instrumental variables approaches, to analyze an extended panel of administrative micro data from the Missouri Department of Higher Education, which will be merged with data from the United States Census and the Common Core of Data provided by the National Center of Education Statistics. The multidisciplinary research team from engineering education, public policy, and economics will integrate their content knowledge, multiple theoretical perspectives, and methodological approaches to generate a boundary-spanning examination of diversity, student access, and engineering achievement to advance the research literature and promote policy design for a wide range of academic and applied audiences. Thus, the project will generate evidence that stakeholders and policymakers in school districts, higher education institutions, and government agencies can apply to help remove obstacles, target resources, and create partnerships that can potentially lead to larger scale, systemic transformations in the pathways to engineering education."

Research findings will provide a foundation for future work focused on the identification, design, and implementation of curricular and programmatic transformation in engineering and computer science, towards the end of creating equitable, just educational environments that intentionally recognize the various aspects of students' identities, recognize the importance of social, economic and political power and its differential, stratifying impact on lived experiences, and affirm students across their differences.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that students who identify along social categories that are centered in US culture (e.g., white, able bodied, heterosexual, male, Christian, socioeconomic affluence) will have a higher sense of belonging and self-efficacy as they progress through their undergraduate engineering programs, relative to those who identify with other groups. Both sense of belonging and self-efficacy have been shown to be positively correlated to retention and to professional identity formation. Because relational and structural power accrues to those who most closely approximate the mythical norm, those who do not align with these social categories may be compelled to assimilate or to withhold or even deny integral parts of their social and cultural identities as a means to successfully navigate engineering culture. This is referred to as ""identity severance"" and it is hypothesized that it is negatively correlated to persistence in engineering education and practice. Achieving the above stated goal will require that we investigate both student and faculty perceptions of intersecting social identities and their confluence with engineering culture.

Student veterans bring valuable assets to their engineering education, but more research is needed to understand their academic and social acculturation into campus life. Therefore, this project aims to (1) identify why veterans pursue bachelor's degrees in engineering, (2) illustrate veteran experiences in engineering education, and (3) advance knowledge on how academic institutions can further support veterans in engineering. This comparative case study of student veterans in engineering across four academic institutions will include interviews of student veterans and key stakeholders, as well as a content analysis of materials and websites related to student veteran issues and concerns. The interdisciplinary research team from engineering, sociology, and education brings expertise on veterans, gender, race/ethnicity, social capital, and persistence in higher education that provides a strong foundation for advancing knowledge in engineering education.<br/><br/>Supporting more veterans to transition to successful careers in engineering is a vital service to the nation. Broadening the participation of veterans in engineering offers the potential to enhance diversity in engineering across multiple dimensions since, compared to civilian students, veterans are more likely to be older, first-generation college, disabled, African-American, or Latino. The study results will provide context and information for various applications, such as: development of new strategies to support student veterans' success, identification of overlooked areas to promote student veterans' participation in engineering, and generation of critical information for development of larger-scale studies for investigating student veterans in engineering. A comprehensive dissemination plan ensures that the study results, particularly the best practices for supporting veterans in engineering, reach diverse audiences interested in student veterans and engineering education. The advisory board includes a variety of stakeholders who have the interest, expertise, and commitment to act on the policy implications of the study."

The instructor receives instantaneously a variety of materials digitally (text, diagrams, equations, graphs) and uses these in the same class meeting to focus and clarify student thinking, modify misconceptions, reinforce correct understandings, increase student metacognition, and generally use class time more effectively. This approach is workable even in classrooms with large enrollments. <br/><br/>Widespread adoption of the Tablet Model logically requires 1) less expensive avenues of implementation; 2) broader, research-based evidence of its effectiveness in diverse classroom environments; and 3) guidance on best practices. This project is providing substantially more information to meet these needs. This project measures learning gains achieved when using open-format questions with a variety of low-cost pen-enabled mobile computing devices for real-time formative assessment. These gains are compared with gains achieved from using more traditional teaching paradigms. It is also measuring the variable impact on these learning gains of situational factors: STEM discipline, course content, institution type, and student gender and ethnicity. An effort is being made to identify best practices in order to assist adopters. Both laboratory and lecture-based courses are being adapted to this approach -- at both the introductory and advanced undergraduate levels of instruction -- in the disciplines of physics, chemical engineering, and biology. This work is being carried out in an engineering university and a community college."

However, in the case of hurricane evacuation, normally positive factors of community strength (social capital, social cohesion, and large social networks) may paradoxically provide incentives for certain persons to avoid following evacuation orders issued by authorities. In particular, long-term residents, defined as those living in the community for more than 10 years, fail to follow evacuation orders at a higher rate than other groups. Peer pressure, perceived obligations to family, friends, and community organizations, and membership in a very close-knit social group that has weathered many previous storms all may play a role in this failure of long-term residents to evacuate.<br/><br/>Past research has primarily looked at demographic and socio-economic factors, such as age, income, level of education, composition of household, and race or ethnicity to understand the hurricane evacuation decision. This study will take a different approach and look at social factors that contribute to community bonding. Data sources will include information about volunteerism, involvement in local civic organizations, neighborhood solidarity and trust, location and numbers of family members and friends, perception of local government and other factors that may quantify social causes for evacuation failure. If it is indeed their strong social ties, generally seen as a public good, that lead to long-term residents' failure to evacuate, the identification of new interventions that could increase evacuation among this group has broad potential impact for public health and safety."

For over a decade, ISMAR (and its forerunner events IWAR/ISAR and ISMR) has been the premier international conference on research into the science, technology, applications and uses of Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR). The proliferation of powerful mobile hardware has opened up new avenues of research into MR and AR while enabling corporate and consumer applications on a wide scale. Across this spectrum fascinating new types of user interfaces, technologies, and concepts are beginning to emerge. The field is highly interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together technologists, educators, humanists, artists and social scientists, among others. ISMAR is one of the largest meetings devoted to the advancement of mixed reality, augmented reality, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction with the physical world, and encourages six different submission types: Papers and Posters, Workshops, Panels, Tutorials, Demonstrations and Contests. Because of the diverse fields relevant to mixed and augmented reality, ISMAR content is organized in two tracks: The Science & Technology (S&T) program and The Arts, Media and Humanities (AMH) program. The top papers are often extended, reviewed, and submitted for publication in the prestigious IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. More information about the conference may be found at http://ismar.vgtc.org/. <br/><br/>This was the second Doctoral Consortium held in conjunction with an ISMAR symposium. A total of 7 graduate students participated in the workshop, along with senior members of the community (faculty and industry researchers) who served as mentors. The goal was to provide the students with an opportunity at a critical time in their careers to present their work to a group of mentors and peers from a diverse set of academic and industrial institutions, to receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the ISMAR community. To these ends participants were asked to prepare both a technical presentation and a poster describing their work. A pre-event social dinner allowed the attendees (students, mentors and organizers) to get to know each other. The following day all attendees met for an informal breakfast at 8:00 AM, after which each student participant had 50 minutes devoted to his/her research, beginning with a presentation for approximately 30 minutes followed by about 20 minutes reserved for an extensive discussion with the other graduate student participants and the senior researchers. The discussion was facilitated by the Doctoral Consortium co-chairs and mentors, with the goal of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the research, challenges and issues, implications of the results, potential suggestions for additional approaches or follow-on work, and career guidance related to the student's work and area. The posters were on display during the ISMAR conference poster sessions (in which the students were expected to take part), and were marked as being part of the Doctoral Consortium. All results from the Doctoral Consortium, including the procedures followed, were archived in the ISMAR 2013 DC binder as a reference for next year's conference.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The organizers took steps proactively to achieve a diversity of research topics, disciplinary backgrounds, methodological approaches, and home institutions among the students, to ensure that they met people outside their own specific area. For example, a maximum of one graduate student per institution was selected. Factors such as gender and ethnicity were also taken into account, with an emphasis on including underrepresented groups. Due in part to the remote location of this year's conference, in the end most of the student participants were from foreign universities; funding for the international students was secured from other sources, with NSF funds being requested only to support the 2 students from U.S. institutions of higher learning."

The goal of the project is to study people's participation in local political activities. The effects of economic restructuring will be analyzed as they affect local conceptions of `the public` whose interest should be served. The extent to which the community component of Human Capital varies as local groups are estranged from participation, both formally through voting and informally through behavioral participation in local public institutions such as schools, law enforcement and health clinics will be examined. The communities will vary by whether their primary economic orientation is from the public sector, the private firm sector, or whether the communities are `consumption` oriented, including retirement and educational communities. Extensive in-depth local ethnographies will be carried out in each of the five places, as well as case studies of local `dramas of contestation`, or conflicts over resources carried out in the public sphere. At the end of the fieldwork a final survey of 300 individuals in one of the communities will be carried out to see how the ethnographic material can inform survey research. This research is important because it focuses on an issue of great concern: the preservation and extension of the community component of the Human Capital of America's public sphere, where matters of public concern and common resource problems are debated. It will advance our understanding of how the changing American political economy affects local integrating and segregating practices among people viewed as different because of their race, ethnicity, or other characteristics. The methodology used, of focusing on local cultural narratives and interpretations of significant cases of conflict, will shed light on basic processes of how cultural interpretations of differences lead to differences in public resource distributions and shape group relations."

Autor, MIT and NBER<br/>Gordon H. Hanson, UCSD and NBER<br/><br/>Abstract. Economic theory suggest that by allowing countries to specialize according to their comparative advantage international trade gives consumers access to a greater variety of products, raising their real incomes. Realizing these gains often brings about substantial changes in national industry structure, as workers move out of import-competing sectors and into other activities. The public debate about globalization tends to center less on the long-run benefits of trade and more on the short-run costs of workers, firms, and industries from adjusting to import competition. Characterizing the adjustment costs associated with trade is therefore important for framing the policy discussion about global economic integration.<br/><br/>This project examines the impact of exposure to import competition on the employment and earnings trajectories of U.S. workers over the long term. The focus is on growth in U.S. imports from China, though imports from other low-wage countries are also considered. To measure worker outcomes, the project makes use of individual-level data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) over the period 1978 to 2007. The SSA data contain a complete history of a worker's annual earnings by employer and by industry, as well as information on receipts of Social Security benefits. These data make it possible to estimate how exposure to import competition affects worker employment, earnings, and benefits uptake by firm and by sector and how these outcomes vary according to a worker's demographic characteristics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, foreign-born status), skill level, and employer characteristics. Administrative data have been used extensively in the analysis of the impact of job loss on worker incomes, but they have been underutilized in considering the consequences of U.S. trade. The project will thus provide evidence on long-run adjustment to trade among U.S. workers than is missing in the literature.<br/><br/>Motivating the focus on China is the country's spectacular economic growth, particularly in manufacturing. Since the early 1990s, Chinas has accounted for nearly three quarters of the growth in manufacturing value added by low and middle income countries. For the United States, China's impact is compounded by a profound imbalance in the two countries' aggregate exports and imports. China runs a large trade surplus, whereas the U.S. runs a large trade deficit. U.S. industries exposed to the increase in China's trade capacity have consequently faced a major expansion in global competition on the supply side, without an offsetting expansion in consumer spending for their products on the demand side. China's export growth appears to be largely attributable to its remarkable improvements in domestic industrial productivity arising from the dismantling of state control and the liberalization of restrictions on trade and investment. <br/><br/>The project unites two disparate bodies of knowledge. One, on how international trade affects labor markets, examines how changes in import competition alter wages and employment in the short or medium run by studying these changes in impacted firms, industries, or regions. While this approach uncovers the temporary effects of greater import competition, it misses impacts on workers that persist after an individual leaves his firm, abandons his industry, or relocates to another city or state. By utilizing long-run data on individual workers available in the SSA data, the project captures how increased trade with China changes earnings and uptake of Social Security benefits that workers experience while employed at their initial firm, after they move to a new firm in the same industry, after they shift to a new industry altogether, and after they exit from employment entirely. Decomposing the long-run change in earnings into these four components shows where in the transition process workers face the most significant adjustment costs, results that will help guide future theoretical work on trade and labor markets. The second body of related literature tracks the earnings of workers who are displaced from their jobs. Because job loss that is involuntary is difficult to identify in available data, much research uses administrative records to isolate extreme cases of displacement, such as mass layoffs associated with plant closures or substantial downsizings. The literature shows that job loss due to mass layoffs has significant negative long-run effects on worker earnings. By using administrative data, the project, like the earlier displaced-worker literature, captures the long-run effects of changes in labor-market conditions. By focusing on a specific type of change, namely one related to greater import competition from China, the project examines all types of job loss related to trade and not just those associated with mass layoffs."

This project studies how two culturally-informed, individually-held sets of beliefs, gender schemas (beliefs about the appropriate roles and ?essential natures? of men and women) and self-conceptions (gendered beliefs about the self), inspire decision-making that reproduces occupational gender segregation. Using a unique, NSF-funded longitudinal panel data of students from four institutions (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Olin, Smith and University of Massachusetts), and the co-investigator will study gender schemas and self-conceptions to determine if and how they influence students? major selections and their career decisions 18 months after graduation. The analysis consists of three parts: an examination of (I) the co-construction of gender schemas and self-conceptions over time and their variation by gender, race and ethnicity, sexual identity, socio-economic background and school; (II) whether these individual-level beliefs predict major selection and career launch; and (III) whether these beliefs lead to the development of gendered professional identities among a subsample of engineering students. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This research investigates why occupational gender segregation is so resilient, despite the steep rise and broad dissemination of egalitarian legal and cultural mandates over the last four decades. If culturally-informed beliefs about the self are indeed strong predictors of career-related actions, addressing this segregation would require either fostering reflexivity about the gendered nature of individuals? self-expressive actions. Study findings have implications for sex-typed professions facing a shortage of practitioners in the coming decades, particularly the recruitment of women into STEM fields and men into nursing and education. Also, findings may provide insights for K-12 efforts that reach students as they form their self-conceptions and gender schemas. Plans for dissemination include scholarly publications as well as research-based recommendations that would possibly be of interest to diversity program coordinators, policymakers and administrators for how to better recruit underrepresented students into gender-typed fields."

The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept. They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom. Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities. Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction. We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions. Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class. We are varying the types of questions, amounts of response data students see and questioning techniques to determine which combinations provide the richest learning experiences. Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity. Such documentation is leading to recommendations for how faculty can employ such assessments in the most inclusive way possible."

While social scientists long have recognized the importance of behavior in affecting impressions of competence, these models are the first to permit precise predictions of those effects, and to integrate the effects with other sources of inequality such as status differences among individuals. Variant models, developed from a well-established tradition of status characteristics, performance expectations, and group structures, will be constructed and tested in laboratory situations designed to permit a high degree of control over initial situations and good visibility of predicted effects. The theoretical outcomes of the project will be increased understanding of causes and consequences of inequality in small groups, and improved models of face-to-face behavior.

The empirical work develops new techniques to create theoretically meaningful behavior and observe effects, and puts theoretical extensions on a sound evidential footing. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: (1) Benefits to society: Because status hierarchies and status behaviors are ubiquitous, this research advances precise understanding of factors affecting most social groups. The PIs intend to predict how behaviors affect hierarchies, and to identify behavioral techniques for weakening or reinforcing effects of status advantages and disadvantages, such as those resulting from gender and ethnicity. (2) Broad dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding: Results will be published in academic journals and in non-technical outlets where appropriate. The data, as well as operational programs developed will be made publicly available to other researchers and students.

The research will improve the theoretical model and contribute to a large body of empirical research on status processes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work will appear in schools and organizational settings as applied researchers develop ways to control the status creation process using techniques similar to those we develop in the laboratory. For several decades, status generalization theories have been used to design interventions to reduce harmful effects of existing status characteristics such as ethnicity and gender; from this work we will understand ways to head off the creation of new characteristics, and to eliminate their status value. Such approaches should be very useful, eliminating status effects rather than partially overcoming them, or creating new status characteristics instead of temporarily conferring some status advantages and disadvantages. Even without interventions, understanding the process of status creation can allow observers to guard against it in their assessments of other individuals. Finally, this collaborative project links experienced PIs with a younger PI, strengthening the research infrastructure at both of the institutions."

The committee and panels shall also perform a one-time assessment of the need for standards, guidelines, or strategies for ensuring the responsible development of nanotechnology. As part of this effort, the National Academies shall also organize a workshop to study the technical feasibility of molecular self-assembly for the manufacture of materials and devices at the molecular scale. These tasks are intended to evaluate the progress and extent of the multi-agency program, to recommend new or revised goals and metrics, to analyze the relative position of the United States in this growing field, and to analyze the impact of nanotechnology on the U.S. economy. A peer-examined NRC report containing evidence-based conclusions and recommendations based on the committee's consensus will be delivered to the Congress on or before June 10, 2005. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>The intellectual merit of this proposed activity is to provide a forum for an independent assessment of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. In addition to producing a final report, the study activity itself will provide a forum for national-level discussion and interaction centered around the most important issues. Within the realm of nanotechnology, no other forum exists where independent individuals can discuss these issues in such an open and objective way. National Academies processes ensure voluntary participation from industry, academia, and non-<br/>governmental organizations of a type that does not exist elsewhere. In many instances, such committee activities have resulted in creative and original concepts that have been used to shape future policy implementation and new technology developments. <br/><br/>The study will be a formal activity of the Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences. National Materials Advisory Board within The National Academies. The National Academies is a unique institution within the United Stated dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Strict internal policies and procedures ensure that the National Academies remains objective and independent in the projects that it undertakes. The staff assigned to the project are some of the best analysts and writers in the country, and the and the members of the Board are high-level representatives of industry, academia, and government who will bring with them many years of combined experience in a number of related fields. In addition to the National Materials Advisory Board and staff, a number of other organizations within the Academies and a large number of members of the Academies will be consulted and are expected to contribute to the various study activities. <br/><br/>The study process will have an impact well beyond the meeting room in which discussions and presentations will take place. Each member of the committee, as well as the speakers and workshop participants, will take a new perspective back to their organization and will use information obtained through participation to inform future decision making. Ultimately, the broader impact of the study activity and final report is to bring an objective and independent assessment to bear on future program activities of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. <br/><br/>Impact Statement <br/>This study activity is intended to educate the public as well as funding agencies and other stakeholders about the larger aspects and potential impacts of the federal government investment in nanotechnology. The study is designed as a convening mechanism to facilitate dialogue and exchange information among a committee representing all sides of the issues. This committee will be balanced for a variety of factors, including discipline, institutional affiliation, age, race, gender, ethnicity, and geography, and the committee process will ensure that the members are free of conflicts of interest or excessive bias. The funding provided will be used for staff time to nominate the committee, organize meetings, arrange briefings and other visits; to compensate committee members and briefers for their travel costs; and finally for photocopying and distribution of relevant information and printing and distribution of the final report. This final report is intended to be accessible and useful to researchers and students; to program managers with responsibilities in health, space, defense, transportation, and energy; to product developers and business leaders; and to teachers on all levels. Outreach to the community will be widespread and the ultimate benefits are a greater awareness of national priorities and enhanced understanding of the impacts of the development and implementation of nanotechnology in our society."

The data from the longitudinal aspect of the study will be combined with data from surveys and in-depth interviews. The research team has unique access to existing longitudinal data sets from the University of North Carolina General Administration (UNC system's 16 campuses) and the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. The study has the support of major educational institutions in the state that have agreed to provide grades 8-16 data for students in both systems. The qualitative aspect of the study provides a rich data source for examining in greater detail the experiences women have had as they make their way through grades 8-12 to becoming STEM majors in and graduates from post-secondary education institutions. The research examines the relationships among gender, ethnicity/race, and socio-economic status with other individual and structural/organizational factors, such as qualification of STEM teachers, gender composition of faculty by campus and by department, and the racial composition of student body by campus and by major. The focus on the experiences of women (completer, avoiders, and leavers) in STEM has the potential to make a major contribution in this area of research.

This study emphasizes the ways in which distinctive backgrounds can be sources of strengths for youngsters and for young adults, and how such strengths bolster resilience and enhance the likelihood of successful outcomes.<br/><br/>Within this framework, three perspectives bear on the research. One deals with group differences in values and motivations and how such differences affect outcomes. Because race, ethnicity, and gender differences are related to variation in motivation and learning styles, students are academically challenged in different ways. This study demonstrates how cultural values shape motivation and learning styles, and also how school and young adult outcomes are affected by whether such differences are recognized in families and schools. Moreover, motivational levels are related to achievement (learning) trajectories, but minority youth and females are particularly susceptible to ""shock"" (such as a family death or changing schools) that throw them off their trajectories. Thus, achievement is treated as a dynamic process that involves group variation in values, changing levels of motivation, and how students rebound from shocks to regain their learning trajectories. <br/><br/>The second perspective relates to group differences in social attachments. Such attachments are defined in terms of types of relationships - peers, neighbors, teachers, family members, and others and also in terms of their salience, or importance. There are group differences with respect to profiles involving types and salience of relationships, and, these, in turn, affect school outcomes. The third perspective relates to school and neighborhood, or contextual, variation, and how such variation directly and indirectly affects achievement. Contextual variation is defined in relational terms, including diversity (heterogeneity), inequality, and consolidated inequality (when inequality is systematically related to group differences). School and neighborhood characteristics that are generally used in education studies, as well as new measures of neighborhood characteristics, are included. <br/><br/>The research uses Department of Education data sets: National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), the High School Effectiveness Study (HSES), and the Common Core of Data (for schools). Neighborhood characteristics are drawn from the 1990 US census (zip-code level) and from IRS (zip-code level) data on community organizations.<br/><br/>New procedures are used to measure youths' profiles of types of relationships and their salience, to parameterize contextual effects, and to analyze achievement trajectories. Achievement and school outcomes are considered in terms of processes that involve values, motivation, and attachments nested within family, school, and neighborhood environments. The research uses fuzzy-set and dynamic, multi-level modeling techniques to capture these processes."

The study, which will have a strongly comparative focus, conceives of ""resistance"" as an ensemble of strategies, a continuum ranging from everyday acts of refusal through dramas of alterity, carnivals of terror, rebellions and social movements, to formal political organizations. In exploring the conditions under which black South Africans have defied those who rule them, and in describing the means by which they have done so, the study seeks to answer a number of questions about the nature of resistance. In what circumstances do disempowered peoples seek remedy and redress in the law? When and why do they resort to other means, means either illegal or alegal? Do some forms of insubordination encourage or preclude others? What is the role of consciousness and intention in the motivation of protest--and in determining its historical significance? Is it possible to move beyond a purely reactive view of defiance to grasp the active cultural construction of its means and ends? How do we understand the roles of social class, ethnicity, race, gender, and generation in resistance? The investigation will involve the analysis of documentary sources, supplemented by interviews, in Southern Africa and Britain.

Emotional understanding is defined as both recognition accuracy (correctly identifying emotions seen in others) and emotion knowledge (knowing what people feel in certain situations as well as the causes and consequences of those feeling states). A conceptual model will be tested in which mothers' beliefs about emotions; their parenting styles and their own understanding of emotions affect their children's emotional understanding as mediated through mother's socialization behaviors around emotions. The collaborative team of investigators explores relationships between multiple components of emotion understanding (including accuracy regarding emotions people show on their faces, and knowledge about when and why people have certain feelings, and show or control their feelings). They will also examine how the multiple components of children's emotion understanding affect children's social skills and relationships with teachers and peers, and each of these associations will be studied within the contexts of race and class. This project is one of the first to examine children's emotion understanding comprehensively, dynamically, and within relationships; to fully explore the effects of mothers' parenting styles, emotion-related beliefs, and socialization behaviors on children's emotion understanding; to include maternal variables, children's emotion understanding, and children's social competence in school in one study; and to consider the effects of race and class on all of the above within a fully balanced design in which race and class are not confounded.<br/><br/>This work will provide opportunities for research training at both UNC and North Carolina State, including participants from underrepresented groups in a sample well-balanced by ethnicity and SES.

Three institutions join efforts for this purpose: University of Colorado at Boulder, University of Colorado at Denver, and University of Washington. FA, in the context of the study, is viewed as a process contributing to the science learning of ELLs, as opposed to the administration of discrete sets of instruments to collect data from students. The study targets Spanish-speaking, elementary and middle school students. Findings from this study contribute to advance knowledge and understanding of FA as an inherent component of the science learning process in linguistically diverse classrooms, and to define a research agenda aimed at enhancing science teachers' ability to enact equitable and effective assessment practices for this student subpopulation. <br/><br/><br/>Three research questions guide the work: (1) What FA practices are occurring in science classrooms that serve predominantly mainstream students and in those serving predominantly ELLs?; (2) How are teachers' FA practices for mainstream students different from or similar to those used with ELLs?; and (3) How do contextual factors and teachers' cultural and linguistic competencies influence FA practices? To address these questions, two conceptual frameworks are used--one for characterizing FA events; the other for examining FA events as a communication process. The study employs a mixed-methods research approach with emphasis on case studies. The sample size consists of three school districts in Colorado and Washington, 16 classrooms (8 elementary, 8 middle school), 16 teachers, and 96 ELLs. Classrooms are selected to represent a particular combination of four factors: (a) teacher ethnicity, (b) teacher formal academic preparation in teaching ELLs, (c) type of linguistic student background, and (d) grade level. Students are selected through a stratified random sample, identified by achievement level (i.e., low, medium, high), and linguistic background (i.e., mainstream, ELL). Data collection strategies to document the implementation of FA at the beginning, during, and at the end of a science unit include: (a) classroom observation protocols, (b) classroom video-recording, (c) video/artifact simulated recall, (d) assessment artifacts, (e) student interviews, (f) teacher questionnaires, (g) teacher interviews, (h) school principal interviews, and (i) school observations. Reliability and validity of most of the data-gathering instruments is determined through pilot studies. Data interpretation strategies include: (a) coding based on the two conceptual frameworks, (b) scoring rubrics to identify levels of effectiveness, and (c) narratives and profiles to describe FA patterns. Publications and the development of a website constitute the main dissemination strategies. A technical advisory board is responsible for formative and summative evaluation. Key evaluation questions are: (1) To what extent does the project enhance research on ELL FA practices through case studies?, and (2) How effectively do the project dissemination activities facilitate understanding of FA practices? <br/><br/>Major project outcomes include: (1) a description of the patterns of formal and informal FA practices for ELLs; (2) a comparison of the FA practices observed in classrooms that vary on the dimensions of teacher characteristics and linguistic diversity; and (3) an empirically and theoretically informed set of findings and strategies for supporting teachers to enact and enhance FA practices sensitive to cultural and linguistic diversity. Three main products are developed: (1) a monograph describing the FA practices observed across the different classrooms with concrete examples; (2) a description of possible professional development strategies to improve in-service FA practices for linguistically diverse students; and (3) a research-informed approach for analyzing FA practices. Besides filling the existing research gap on FA with ELLs, outcomes and products serve as a foundation for a future research agenda and a comprehensive project aimed at ensuring equitable science learning for all students, including ELLs."

The principal methods of this work come from the soliton theory. Solitons are very special solitary waves (""bumps"") of water that move with constant speed without any deterioration in their shape. The first soliton siting was described in 1834 by the Scottish naval architect John Scott Russell, who noticed this wave in a channel and pursued it on his horse for quite a while. The soliton theory was originated in the mid-1960s from the fundamental Gardner-Greene-Kruskal-Miura discovery of the inverse scattering transform (IST) for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for shallow water waves (this equation happens to describe the channel phenomenon that Russell observed). Soon thereafter different versions of IST were found for many other physically important nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) referred to as completely integrable systems. Being conceptually similar to the Fourier transform, the IST has yielded a tremendous amount of information about completely integrable systems, far beyond what standard PDE techniques may offer. Soliton theory is regarded as a major achievement of the 20th century science connecting different branches of pure mathematics and theoretical physics with numerous applications ranging from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. Much of work in soliton theory has been done on the propagation of waves initiated by rapidly decaying or periodic initial data (the so-called classical data). The corresponding solutions have a relatively simple and well understood wave structure of running solitons accompanied by radiation of decaying waves, or periodic wave-trains and their modulations. However any deviation from classical data meets principal difficulties that are yet to be surmounted. The project will focus on soliton theory for initial profiles that are much broader than classical. We expect new types of solutions with much more complicated wave structure and far-reaching practical applications. It is expected that the results could be used for understanding rogue waves, soliton propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves, certain meteorological phenomena (e.g. morning glory), or for the study of propagation of coherent structures in noisy media in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, etc.<br/><br/>In the context of the KdV equation the principal investigator has reformulated the classical IST in terms of Hankel operators and Titchmarsh-Weyl m-functions that let one extend the IST to a surprisingly broad class of initial data. This was achieved by employing some subtle properties of the m-function and deep results from the theory of Hankel operators. The principal investigator plans to use powerful methods of Hankel operators to identify the broadest possible class of initial profiles for which a suitable analog of the IST exists. Another objective is asymptotic analysis of the underlying solutions. The well-known powerful machinery of the classical Riemann-Hilbert problem breaks down on such initial profiles in a number of serious ways. The main thrust will be put on understanding how to make the Riemann-Hilbert problem work far outside of the realm of classical problems. The results are expected to be instrumental for various applications. The accompanying mathematical problems are also very important to the theory of the Schrodinger operator, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, and the theory of Hankel and Toeplitz operators, fundamental objects of operator theory. Uncovering connections between soliton theory and Hankel operators theory is of great independent interest and could potentially have a profound influence on both theories. The project will have a very large educational component. The principal investigator is committed to continuing his research experience for undergraduates program on nonlinear wave phenomena to identify and mentor young scholars in the field of applied mathematics. It is his intent to attract a diverse (gender, ethnicity, disability) group of talented undergraduates into the program to broaden the participation of underrepresented in the mathematical sciences groups."

According to the literature in the field, more than half of job seekers find their positions through personal ties and social connection (social capital). The concepts of social capital and social ties have become central to the core of sociological thinking, and the theoretical purpose of this study is to test and refine this thinking. However, disagreement persists within this literature about the types of ties that are used by diverse population groups in the job search process, and about the benefit of these ties. More recently, a rising number of studies have examined the importance of understanding the organizational context in which social ties are activated. <br/><br/>This study has three goals. First, to advance our understanding of the types of network ties including family, school, and other ties (strong or weak) used by diverse groups of individuals as they search for and attain jobs. Second, to investigate the organizational context in which school ties are developed and whether academic departments provide resources to help students gain ties. A longitudinal survey of the college class of 2011 will provide the basis for testing the impact of different types of student social capital on their post-graduate job search and placement, as well as the role organizational context plays in shaping those ties. As a case in point, the study focuses on Sociology majors, who tend to be found in a wide variety of occupations. Thus, the third goal of this study is to examine whether majors perceive that the jobs they obtain reflect their original field of training and, finally, whether these jobs can be characterized into specific scientific or applied occupational fields and sectors. The practical focus of this study is whether network ties that are encouraged by academic departments lead majors to jobs in the field. We will test a series of hypotheses about the type of social capital (network ties) seniors use when searching for jobs, the context in which these social ties develop, and how types of ties vary by race, ethnicity and gender. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This study has broader implications for several stakeholders. Institutions of higher education have a vested interested in understanding the school-to-work transition. A lack of understanding about how academic majors search for and secure jobs, and the kind of social connections that help graduates in this process, can result in arts and science departments losing majors to more vocationally-oriented programs and institutions. Such loss is also problematic for the science pipeline in general. Moreover, given that today's college students are entering a job market with the highest unemployment in a generation, and are saddled with increasing debt, it is reasonable for students and their parents to be concerned about job prospects. Ultimately, potential beneficiaries of this proposed longitudinal study include but are not limited to the approximately 17,000 sociology majors that graduate each year and go directly into the labor market and the society which might benefit from their training and skill set."

Five longstanding programs for girls, begun 5-20+ years ago, will be the focus of the proposed study and include the National Science Partnership (NSP), Girls at the Center (GAC), Wonderwise, and Women in Natural Sciences (WINS). The selected study projects have access to girl participants who are high-school aged or older and represent diverse race, ethnicity and SES. A national Research Advisory Council will ground the investigation and review the findings at each stage of the research.<br/><br/>The Community of Practice (CoP) literature (Lave and Wenger, 1991) will provide the theoretical frame for the overarching research question. Findings will document long-term impacts of girls' participation in identified informal science programs, determine how informal contexts in general contribute to girls' science learning and achievement, and develop a model for understanding the impact of informal science learning initiatives. Deliverables will include specific examples of informal learning experiences that support girls' long-term participation in science and evidence of the types of influences, including significant adults and particular activities, that contribute to girls' trajectories of participation. Dissemination tools will be a national conference, a research monograph and a series of workshops conducted in conjunction with professional conferences for informal science educators. <br/><br/>By better understanding the impact of informal programs in science, specifically and more generally, and by developing and demonstrating an effective model for understanding such impact across projects, the proposed research stands to inform the field and provide a base for future project development and research efforts. The research results will improve the understanding of practice in these arenas and will document the significant role that informal programs place in influencing girls' vocational and avocational choices and participation in STEM fields. The study will also demonstrate the applicability of the CoP research model and its lessons to other informal science programs."

The EA-IRMS system will enhance the scientific and technological education of a socially and economically diverse body of students of all ages, and will substantially advance ongoing and future research by UNH faculty. Specifically, the proposed instrument will enhance the Northern Ecosystems Research for Undergraduates (NERU) program which brings students recruited from underrepresented groups to UNH to study changing northern ecosystems. Stable isotope work has been critical in the majority of NERU projects, and enhanced analytical capabilities at UNH will expand the range of projects for the students, while reducing analytical costs for the program. Access to the EA-IRMS will be provided for middle and high school teachers and students through partnering with the Joan and James Leitzel Center for Mathematics, Science and Engineering Education at UNH, and will provide an opportunity for chemistry, biology, and earth science teachers to use cutting-edge techniques to enhance their scientific and technological preparedness. The proposed instrument will also strengthen the UNH curriculum through creation of two new stable isotope courses and inclusion in up to 13 other UNH courses that together will expose more than 1000 students per year to training in isotopic analyses. Additionally, stable isotope analysis will be integrated into two extensive, ongoing projects promoting healthy nutrition in young adults: the College Health and Nutrition Assessment Survey and a USDA Multi-State Research Project. These projects seek to promote healthy eating habits for students of diverse socioeconomic background and ethnicity across 11 states. <br/><br/>The need for stable isotope analysis has increased dramatically in recent years as a result of the increase in number and breadth of research disciplines that rely on stable isotope techniques, as well as the rapid technological improvements in stable isotope analysis. At UNH, faculty from diverse disciplines will use the EA-IRMS to study a broad range of research topics including: 1) methane cycling in wetlands; 2) coastal nitrogen pollution; 3) marine methyl hydrate production; 4) archaeological analysis of cod fisheries; 5) long term trends in the carbon and water cycles of temperate and tropical forests; 6) the role of wetlands and river systems on controlling flooding and water pollution 7) effects of forest management on small mammal communities; 8) bacterial and fungal controls on soil carbon storage; 9) crop, weed, and soil management for improved food production; 10) the role of fungi in forest ecology and climate change; 11) evaluating the impact of dietary food choices on young adult health;12) linking dairy cow diet to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions; and 13) tracking the consumption of agricultural and human supplied food in deer populations.

The instruments will be used by a research team: the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Infrasense Inc., Massachusetts Port Authority and Maine Department of Transportation. Planned application of the proposed instruments are in the area of non destructive evaluation of highway and airfield pavements, development of test protocols for determination of key properties of existing and new materials, and for determination of effective design, construction and quality control methods. The FWD is necessary for estimation of moduli of existing layers. The GPR, with IR camera, is necessary for determination of pavement layer thickness and conditions information needed for estimation of layer moduli with FWD data. The requested instruments will also be used for undergraduate and graduate education. One example of use of these instruments is in an ongoing National Science Foundation project in a full-scale instrumented facility for determination of pavement layer responses under traffic. The data obtained from this study will be used in research as well as for teaching principles of pavement analysis and design, and use of non-destructive testing. The total cost of projects is about ten times the cost of the requested instrument, and potential benefit to cost ratio is very high. The requested instruments are critical for developing Non Destructive testing capabilities of the research team for current as well as future research projects.

Gilman, Bernard A. Schriever will conduct analysis that brings together data from museum collections of three excavated Mimbres sites (Old Town, Galaz, and Wind Mountain) with data collected during his fieldwork to investigate the potential formation of a common identity among them. These sites are but three of many contemporary Mimbres communities located in southwestern New Mexico and occupied from at least A.D. 750 through 1130. While Mimbres sites exhibit differences from each other, there are clearly similarities in development, architecture, and material culture, that distinguish them from sites in surrounding areas (like the Hohokam of Arizona and the Anasazi to the north). In other words, they are a regional phenomenon of shared culture that archaeologists recognize as the Mimbres. Schriever's research focuses on using multiple lines of evidence to examine an essential concern in archaeology. Do the cultures defined by archaeologists, like the Mimbres, simply represent people sharing similar material culture (things), behaviors, and adaptations to the world? Or, could these cultures have been actual identities to the people who shared them?<br/><br/>Research into the relationship between archaeologically defined cultures and the identities of the people who lived within the areas encompassed by these cultures is critical in archaeologists' endeavor to explain the processes that lead to the formation, transformations, and dissolution of past societies. This is because identities, such as race, class, and ethnicity, are fundamental to people's daily lives, constraining and guiding their interactions with others. Identities are the basis for how societies are organized. This project examines practices involved in the production and exchange of goods among the inhabitants of three Mimbres communities. Assessing the variation in these practice provides a means to evaluate the extent to which individuals within a community and among the three communities shared common ways of doing things, the basis for identities. Further, documenting whether and how these practices changed through time will provide insight into the amount of interaction and co-production of practices occurring among the communities' inhabitants, key processes in the formation of identities. <br/><br/>From a broader perspective, this research begins to provide archaeology with a way to communicate the complexities of identity to the public. Given the publics' interest in archaeology, evidenced by the popularity of archaeology in the media, how archaeologists present past people has ramifications for how the public understands people in the past and thinks about people in the present. Archaeologists need ways to discuss their work that make clear the differences between heuristic devices, like archaeologically defined cultures, and the identities of past people, so that the public does not get the impression that the two are the same. In detailing the complexity of people's identities in the past, archaeologists can help the public recognize that the identities of people today are just as problematic, helping to dispel the monolithic treatment of people based on stereotypes of identities. The results of this research will be disseminated through outlets directed toward a variety of constituent groups: presentations and posters at scientific and academic conferences, particularly those open to the public; a website accessible to both the public and scientific community; and publications prepared for both refereed journals and books directed at the scientific community and those media aimed at the public."

Supplemental Instruction (SI) has a long history of increasing student success rates in courses traditionally considered some of the most difficult in higher education. Although the success of SI programs nationwide has been lauded in the literature, the questions that remain unanswered are: i) whether the improvement in student success is a result of self-selection rather than the attributes of the SI program itself, ii) whether SI programs are equally successful for all groups of students, and iii) whether participation in SI results in increased success in subsequent courses and retention within STEM majors. Therefore, using an already established SI Program, the specific objectives of this project are to: 1) Determine whether the success of SI programs is a result of self-selection by the students, 2) Evaluate the variables which can be utilized to predict the degree of success of the SI program for a particular student, and 3) Assess the effect of the SI program on student success in subsequent courses offered by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and retention of the students within STEM majors. The first objective is being addressed by the widespread distribution and results analysis of both a general self-efficacy survey and a chemistry self-efficacy survey, which measure a student's perception of his/her ability to achieve a specific learning outcome. General self-efficacy surveys are currently available, and a chemistry self-efficacy survey has been created specifically for use in this investigation. The second objective is being addressed by evaluating the success of the SI program in each of the courses with respect to grade point average, the number of students receiving a grade of D, F, or W in the class (the DFW rate), gender, ethnicity, desired major, mathematics background, SAT or ACT scores, and status as a first-generation student. The third objective is being addressed by a longevity study where the success of each student is tracked through the subsequent chemistry and biochemistry courses and the retention of the students within STEM majors is monitored. <br/>Broader Impacts. The state of Texas will, over the next few decades, see tremendous growth in population, and the overall population will be less educated unless current trends are altered. The ""Closing the Gaps"" initiative, designed to increase the participation rate in higher education, has resulted in large increases in enrollment at Texas State University-San Marcos. Enrollment in lower-division courses within the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, a department that already serves a large (~24%) Hispanic population, continues to increase; however, the DFW rate for first generation students in general, and minority students in particular, is alarmingly high. An increase in the success rate of students completing the first two years of the chemistry curriculum will bolster the university's ability to produce an educated population, particularly in the STEM programs. Furthermore, Texas State University-San Marcos educates more K-12 teachers than any other institution in the state of Texas. The future teachers impacted through this project are expected to enhance the educational environment of future generations of STEM students. Dissemination of the results of this research investigation through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at professional meetings, and distribution of the self-efficacy survey will provide an opportunity for institutions nationwide to increase the effectiveness of the use of SI in lower-division chemistry courses."

Research shows that causes of achievement gaps in STEM arise from reciprocal interactions between societal, social, and environmental factors that might suppress students' true academic potential in challenging academic STEM domains. This project focuses on environmental factors (identified as social identity threats) that devalue, marginalize, or discriminate against students based on a social identity like race, gender, disability status, or socioeconomic status; such factors can eventually lead students to withdraw and disengage in STEM learning and careers. The objectives of this research are to: (1) synthesize and systematically analyze data from interventions (affirmation writing essays) shown to help reduce the impact of social identity threats on student participation in STEM; and (2) apply results of the synthesis and analyses to enhance existing interventions (e.g., maximize impact on subpopulations of students whose achiement in STEM fields is below their potential).<br/><br/>The research project will proceed in two phases. First, the investigators will create an encrypted online repository of data from more than 2,500 affirmation writing essays, previously collected through randomized double-blind experiments involving approximately 1,400 students who vary by race, ethnicity, age, gender, and social class. The researchers will link this online repository of information to academic and psychological outcomes for middle school and college students. Using natural language processing (NLP), topic modeling, and other methods the investigators will identify sematic content and essay structure processes that mediate affirmation effects and highlight meaning of the effectiveness of the essay writing interventions. <br/><br/>Results of these analyses will be used to develop and test a more robust intervention for reducing social identity threats involving African Americans, White, and female students. One hundred eighty (180) students (90 females and 90 males) will participate in two separate laboratory studies. One, conducted at Columbia University, will focus on race as a social factor; the second, conducted at Penn State University, will focus on gender. The ultimate goal of this work is to uncover and address psychological factors that might otherwise hinder students' participation in STEM careers."

This project will focus on student-centered tools, learning approaches and mentoring interactions that can be utilized throughout a student's four-year college degree. This integrated approach will support deserving students from Mississippi and the Southeastern United States to pursue and complete degrees in the physical sciences and enter science careers. Recruitment efforts with special attention paid to underrepresented populations, as defined by ethnicity and gender, will promote a diverse and capable workforce.<br/><br/>Specific objectives of this project will include (1) Supporting students financially to pursue physical science degrees through scholarships; (2) Supporting students academically to complete a Bachelor's degree in the targeted majors of Chemistry, Math or Physics; and (3) Supporting students through career development strategies to pursue careers in the physical sciences. Student support will be developed as a cohesive, integrated plan that includes academic tutoring support for science and math classes, a focus on the development of study skills and time management strategies and co-registration in both gateway science courses, and a 1-credit hour course on Mathematics as a Common Language for the scholarship cohort. Mentoring workshops and career development activities will be a continued focus in addition to research experiences for undergraduates. Assessment and evaluation of the project will be both formative and summative. An external evaluator will coordinate and evaluate survey instruments and achievements to assess projected outcomes and the level of achievement of the stated goals of the project. Lessons learned and effective practices that emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community and help increase widespread understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs."

The research question is how characteristics come to carry connotations of esteem, social worth, and performance skills instead of being simply descriptive terms. Theoretically, under specified conditions, status value can spread from existing status characteristics to new nominal characteristics, changing them from simple descriptors to indications of social worth and ability. The research strategy is to design and conduct laboratory experiments to test the theory by attempting to create a new status characteristic in Year 1 at UNC Charlotte, and using complementary techniques to break down an existing status characteristic in Year 2 at Iowa. The research will improve the theoretical model and contribute to a large body of empirical research on status processes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work will appear in schools and organizational settings as applied researchers develop ways to control the status creation process using techniques similar to those we develop in the laboratory. For several decades, status generalization theories have been used to design interventions to reduce harmful effects of existing status characteristics such as ethnicity and gender; from this work we will understand ways to head off the creation of new characteristics, and to eliminate their status value. Such approaches should be very useful, eliminating status effects rather than partially overcoming them, or creating new status characteristics instead of temporarily conferring some status advantages and disadvantages. Even without interventions, understanding the process of status creation can allow observers to guard against it in their assessments of other individuals. Finally, this collaborative project links experienced PIs with a younger PI, strengthening the research infrastructure at both of the institutions."

Group size has many important consequences, such as affecting the spread and transmission of infectious diseases both within the group and to members of other groups. This project seeks to understand why groups of variable size persist over long-term time scales. As we better understand what promotes variability in group size, we can better predict the extent to which the costs or benefits of group living will change over time. One popular but untested hypothesis is that climatic differences between years cause variation in food supply or in populations of parasites and pathogens, and this in turn causes the payoffs of different group sizes to vary annually. This project builds on a long-term study of a social bird, the cliff swallow, which lives in colonies of widely different sizes, and seeks to investigate whether changing selection on the animals' survival and reproductive success can explain annual variation in group size. The research addresses one of the most fundamental questions in evolutionary ecology. <br/><br/>This project will test the prediction that success of individuals will increase with group size in some years, decrease with group size in others, and remain unchanged in yet other years. It will be determined to what degree the birds' annual nesting success varies from year to year in colonies of different sizes. This will be investigated by systematically collecting data at 20-25 colonies each year. The work will determine the causes of variation in reproductive success by measuring the extent of parasite infestation, time of breeding, bird condition, and other factors. This study will promote better understanding of how group size affects individuals' lifetime reproductive success across long-term time scales, assist in interpreting the extensive variation in group size that is characteristic of many organisms, and reveal the potential influence of recent climatic changes on social behavior. The research will involve women, Native Americans, and students from the Great Plains, promoting STEM training of underrepresented groups with respect to gender, ethnicity, and geographic region."

While some scholars argue that citizenship is no longer legally relevant in the globalized world, empirical tests of the salience of citizenship under the law are scant and cross-national tests have yet to be undertaken. By comparing sentencing outcomes in Germany and the United States ? two advanced democracies with strong rule of law traditions but markedly different conceptions of citizenship and nationhood ? this project empirically evaluates the consequences of being an ?outsider? of the state when punished under the law. In doing so, this project addresses four related questions: 1) Are noncitizens punished more severely in U.S. and German courts? 2) Does the treatment of noncitizens differ between these two countries? 3) How do the effects of citizenship compare to other extra-legal offender attributes in each country? 4) How have practices of punishing noncitizens changed over time in each country, and what might explain these trends? The PIs draw on previous work highlighting exclusionary aspects of national membership and link these ideas with theories of law and punishment that emphasize the detriments of being an ?outsider? in social control institutions to develop hypotheses. Hypotheses are tested with data from U.S. federal courts and German district courts from 1995 to 2009, supplemented by qualitative interviews with judges in two major cities within each country. <br/><br/>With over 200 million international migrants today, understanding the consequences of lacking state membership has implications for policy makers, judicial practitioners, and scholars interested in international law, international migration, stratification, and social control.

Yet we do not know whether such segregation extends to the places where people go during the course of their daily lives. We also do not know how everyday travel to different neighborhoods affects individuals and groups in ways that might increase or diminish segregation. This research seeks to address these gaps by studying segregation in motion, throughout people?s daily routine activities in relation to neighborhood experiences. We ask three fundamental questions: (1) do the areas where people go during the course of their days vary demographically and by the type of neighborhood where they live?; (2) do the areas that different social groups go to during their days vary systematically in terms of their available resources and social diversity?; and (3) how do people?s experiences of the neighborhoods they go to, including how welcome they feel and how they perceive access to resources, vary by their race, ethnicity, economic status, and the type of neighborhood they live in? <br/><br/>To address these questions, we will implement and evaluate an app for smartphones to collect ""live"" information on people's movement and neighborhood experiences as they happen. We will assess the feasibility of obtaining immediate explicit and implicit (nonconscious) measures of experiences in a place using the smartphone app. Pilot data will be collected for a small set of respondents. We will use these data to develop measures of mobile segregation and indicators of how people, in the moment, perceive their surroundings and opportunities in the places they go. Detailed evaluation of the app, its use in the field, and the ability to gain cooperation with the selected sample will allow us to determine whether the methods for collecting dynamic data during the course of everyday social life can be used in larger representative samples. Using cutting-edge mobile technology to collect such data will overcome the risk of recall biases in research that uses surveys or daily diaries to measure how people spend their time and experience their surroundings. <br/><br/>This research will have broad impacts in a several important ways. Obtaining data on how people explicitly and implicitly experience the places they visit, and how those experiences encourage or discourage them from going to certain locales, can help inform policy interventions that incentivize contact across demographic groups. The open source smartphone app developed in the course of this research will be shared with other researchers to advance knowledge on the connections between social, spatial, and cognitive processes and should have broad application beyond the specific study of social segregation in daily life."

What factors are most important to adequately forecast the broader impacts of a disaster and most particularly a terrorist strike?

Interviews with community leaders and first responders will provide input for assessing emergency response systems. Public response will be based on data gathered from a longitudinal survey using three scenarios (earthquake, bomb blast, anthrax release) that unfold over time consistent with crisis news reporting. An economy-wide model based on the behavior of individual businesses and consumers, informed by the risk perception surveys and analyses, will provide estimates of the direct and indirect impacts of risk amplification. <br/><br/>First responders, health care providers, local administrators, and educators stand to directly benefit from a better understanding of the effects of their policies and practices.

India is a particularly important case when studying informal economies because over 90 percent of its workforce is informal. This project analyzes informal waste collection and recycling in Delhi, India, which, despite challenges from legal and private actors, continues to persist and facilitate positive environmental outcomes in India?s capital city. The research asks: What are the relationships and institutions that allow the informal recycling workforce to thrive in spite of private opposition and formal regulation?<br/><br/>The project is designed as an extended case study, which assembles original ethnographic data to revise and build sociological theory on the relationship of state and market institutions to informal urban economies. The primary data to be collected are extensive participation observation with informal recyclers and at least 125 interviews with informal recyclers and legal actors. Two hypothetical positions are examined: the first holds that there is a division between higher and lower levels of legal operation, which results in support for informal enterprise at the local level despite high level disavowal, and a second proposes that while social relations such as kinship and ethnicity prevail within singular informal enterprises, market relations are a primary source of regulation between these informal enterprises. <br/><br/>This project takes steps to understand urban processes in the twenty-first century. From the global cities literature, we know that cities are becoming increasingly connected through markets. However, that research attends only to the world?s wealthiest cities and takes a high-level perspective, when what is needed are more detailed analyses of how global flows and local practices combine to produce urban change. This study draws on sociological tools to open up the ""black box"" of urban informality and theorize how it is produced from the ground up. A detailed look at negotiations between informal actors and those in market and legal institutions provides an opportunity to revise essential sociological theory, while the combined focus on structural barriers and potential for agency holds promise as a paradigm for future urban research. Understanding the formal ties of informal work allows researchers to contribute to the difficult question of how to create change where formal institutions are less strong. Additionally, there is a need to study informal practices that contribute to an urban sustainability agenda. This project addresses both of these issues in a context where approaches to waste management could be revised to produce more positive social and environmental outcomes."

Past research by Williams and others demonstrates two paradoxical effects of ostracism: pro-social responses and anti-social responses. Although people respond pro-socially to ostracism for example by altering their unacceptable behavior, there are also instances in which ostracized individuals react violently, such as recent instances of school shooters. This research proposes to examine empirically the conditions under which ostracism leads to aggressive or anti-social tendencies and responses. First, ostracism is proposed to increase negative emotions and retaliatory response tendencies as a first-level reflexive response, which is moderated toward pro-social response tendencies when time is taken to reflect upon the implications and consequences. Second ostracism is proposed to impact four fundamental needs: belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence. Aggressive responding is more likely to occur when the needs pertaining to control and meaningful existence are especially threatened, whereas prosocial behavior is expected when ostracism threatens primarily needs related to belonging and self-esteem. Finally, ostracism of groups, or ostracism based upon group membership, is proposed to increase anti-social reaction tendencies more so than ostracism of individuals by other individuals. Other research on discontinuity has shown that group-group interactions are more likely to be characterized by competitiveness and distrust than person-person interactions. Thus, ostracism based upon group level characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, or religion, may be particularly prone to aggressive responses. <br/><br/>This research employs a number of innovative techniques, including a powerful yet simple computer based paradigm called ""Cyberball"" in which participants are ostracized from a virtual ball toss game. While appearing to be a rather minor and inconsequential form of ostracism, a recent study published in the magazine Science showed how only a few minutes of playing this game resulted in activation of brain's pain center. Another innovative method is the use of Virtual Reality technology to study the effects of feeling excluded, ignored, and being virtually invisible to other people. In addition, this work explores the effectiveness of the disciplinary procedure of ""time out"" by submitting the results of previously published work to a meta-analysis. This program broadens the participation of underrepresented groups and has the potential to benefit society in the areas of promoting positive educational environments and preventing harmful side effects that can result in school violence and, at a broader level, terrorism."

The proposed research examines whether identity development is key to understanding these educational and developmental trajectories. Although research has shown that the establishment of a clear and positive identity during emerging adulthood is associated with a variety of optimal outcomes, many questions remain regarding how identity is formed, particularly with regard to developing a positive science identity and a sense of belonging with one's STEM field. The overarching goal of the current project is to better understand how identity forms during college by applying a narrative approach, in which identity is understood as developing through a subjective process of integrating life experiences into a personal and self-defining story. Specifically, the unique vantage point of narratives will be used to better understand why some students -- especially women, underrepresented minorities, and those with disadvantaged backgrounds -- disengage from pursuing STEM-related careers while others persist. By combining objective markers (e.g., gender, ethnicity, SES, educational background) with coded narratives that emerge in response to relevant experiences (e.g., in the science classroom), this study may contribute to solutions for the persistent lack of diversity in the sciences. More broadly, by examining how students engage in meaning-making about the critical transitions (e.g., leaving home, choosing a major) and contextualized experiences (e.g., academic, social, romantic) that are central to college life, the proposed research will identify the identity pathways that contribute to increases over time in other important outcomes, including maturity, happiness, and clarity of career goals.<br/><br/>The Identity Pathways Project is a five-year, two-campus longitudinal study that utilizes a quantitative narrative approach. The longitudinal design involves three surveys annually for four years and a final survey one year after graduation. The surveys will include repeated assessments of both narratives (transition to college, academic and relational high and low points, experiences related to major choice and future career) and standard scales of the outcomes of interest. With this design, the proposed research will be able to test the extent to which identity processes operate as mechanisms of developmental change, and more specifically, whether narratives reflecting a positive science identity are a key factor in persistence along a STEM-related career path. The two-campus design, which includes a private liberal arts college and a state university, increases the demographic diversity and allows for a more inclusive examination of identity development, especially as it pertains to career identity and STEM participation. The narrative approach to career identity has important implications for designing career counseling programs, especially those promoting STEM-related career paths among women and minorities."

While much research has explored the effects of neoliberal economic restructuring in post-Soviet regions on ethnicity, labor, and nationalism, fewer studies have paid attention to the connections between gender and domesticity and the geopolitical and economic changes in the region. Anxieties arising from economic liberalization have led to calls for new regulations on family values, gender roles and domesticity. This study will analyze how neoliberalism and nationalism are redefining gender identities in order to shed light on how political actors draw on symbols of the ""home"" and ""family"" to justify restrictive social policies and, in some cases, validate engagement in political conflict. Understanding how political and economic processes link with intimate home and family matters will also help to elucidate the effectiveness of international development programs seeking to empower women. Documenting the way women navigate social and economic change in their everyday lives will inform regional development policies in an effort to alleviate gender based violence and poverty. <br/><br/>Various groups in post-Soviet Armenia have been struggling with economic and geopolitical anxieties caused by continual economic and political transformations. Many of these anxieties have manifested in new concerns over gender roles and the socioeconomic and political meanings of home and domestic spaces. To better understand these changes, this study asks: 1) What is the symbolic significance of the home and practices of domesticity in geopolitical debates? 2) What are the impacts of economic restructuring on practices of domesticity and the spatial politics of home? 3) How do the symbolic meanings of the home and everyday domestic practices become sites for reproducing or contesting neoliberalism and geopolitical divides? Specifically, this research will examine the discursive production of gender and the material conditions within which people experience and navigate economic change. The researchers will employ critical geography perspectives to illuminate how economic transformations materially affect everyday lives and the ways in which gendered subjects are produced or transformed. The study relies on qualitative methods including semi- structured interviews, participant observation, and textual analysis of news and magazine articles about contemporary domesticity. Data gathered from these sources will be triangulated to understand how various actors - citizens, political groups, and international development programs - have renegotiated the value of women's domestic labor as a result of economic restructuring and growing social conservatism."

The first concerns how annual hours of work are determined, with a special emphasis on the largely unresearched issue of paid and unpaid leave. One objective of the study is to provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of work leave. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the Health and Retirement Survey, and other sources are used to provide a basic set of facts about how paid weeks of leave and total weeks of leave vary with wage rates, indicators of hours constraints, weekly work hours, labor market experience, job seniority, union status, supervisory status, firm size, race, gender, and occupation and industry characteristics. The study measures what happens to paid leave when workers change jobs and determines the degree to which leave is a rigid function of firm wide policy or is something that individual employees can bargain over. The broader goal of the project is to improve understanding of the extent to which people can choose between higher compensation and shorter hours and the terms of the tradeoff between them. The analysis will inform policy discussions concerning how the labor market can be modified to better accommodate men and women who are seeking to balance career goals with family obligations. <br/>The second part of the project examines the implications of downward nominal wage rigidity for a broad set of questions in labor economics. There is considerable evidence suggesting that firms are very reluctant to cut nominal wage rates, but there is little research on how barriers to wage cuts influence the personnel decisions of firms. The heart of the study is the development and estimation of a model of the hiring, wage setting, and layoff behavior of a rational, forward looking firm when nominal wages cuts for incumbent workers are too costly to impose. When choosing a wage to fill a vacancy and when setting subsequent wages, such a firm must take account of the fact that the nominal wage chosen today sets a floor on a worker's future wages. In the presence of uncertainty about current and future productivity, paying higher wages to increase hiring rates and retention increases the risk of having to either overpay the worker in a subsequent period or incur the cost of a layoff. The model is estimated and used to revisit a number of important subjects in labor economics where the consequences of nominal wage rigidity have been ignored in previous research. These include studies of the degree to which earnings rise with labor market experience and job seniority, studies of wage dynamics within jobs and across jobs, recent research on employer learning and wage dynamics, studies of statistical discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex, and research on the effects of inflation on the distribution of earnings. The study uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics."

This research will use a comparative, cross-cultural design to clarify whether these behaviors are similar, have the same consequences for children, and pose the same challenges to parents and teachers, in different countries. This has significant implications for child learning and development in cross-cultural circumstances, whether in multi-ethnic classrooms in the U.S. or internationally. It also has implications for conditions in which children's behavior becomes classified as problem behavior, and how interventions for these behaviors might be designed to promote academic and social wellbeing for children and their caregivers.<br/><br/>The comparison will be made between children in three countries: US (Texas), Mexico, and Belize. These cultural settings have been chosen because they have varying teacher and parent values about children's talkativeness and activity. Social and academic consequences of impulsive, inattentive, and hyperactive behaviors will be compared across these settings. Children's behavior will be assessed at home, in the classroom and on the playground, using a combination of anthropological, biological, and psychological methods.<br/><br/>Particular attention will be paid to sex differences in behavior, because previous clinical studies have shown that severe levels of impulsive, inattentive and hyperactive behavior are much more likely to be found in boys. By using a biocultural research design, focusing on both biological and cultural contexts of the behaviors, this study will be able to clarify the roles of cultural and biological variation in producing sex differences in these behaviors. Currently, there is a poor understanding of the girls' and boys' behavior patterns, and the different reactions they may get from teachers, parents and other children. This research also has implications for children's academic and social well being, and why it may vary by sex and ethnicity. Most previous studies have focused only on pathological or extreme degrees of these behaviors, ignoring the fact that most children display these behaviors at least occasionally. Yet, even lesser degrees of impulsive, inattentive and hyperactive behavior may also have significant positive or negative consequences for many children. This study will provide the first clear evidence of the naturally occurring range of these behaviors and should be of interest to researchers in the fields of anthropology, psychology and education."

At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute, system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar/low-nicotine brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration system.<br/><br/>This project will develop, deploy and assess social networking tools to enhance collaboration among members of TSEEN using the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure. The proposed project brings together researchers in information science, social science, and public health who have established strong collaborations with government partners on the development of networks to support transdisciplinary research in public health. The researchers have assisted the government partners in formulating the challenges and envisioning solutions; hence the research team is will positioned to leverage the substantial financial and human resources being invested by NIH National Cancer Institute and its partner government agencies in the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed project is a pioneering effort at incorporating social network referral tools as an integral part of collaborative systems within the context of digital government. First, the proposed project will extend theoretical understanding of the emergence of collaboration network structures involving multidimensional networks, where nodes may be individuals, documents, data sets, services (such as visual-analytic tools), or keywords/concepts. Second, it will pioneer theory development and testing about the influence of network referral systems on collaboration outcomes. Specifically, the proposed project will assess the extent to which collaboration outcomes are influenced by (i) different theoretically-derived structures of network referrals, (ii) different incentive structures provided to users of the network referral system, (iii) different types of network data used to generate referrals, and (iv) different information visualizations used to represent network referrals. Third, the research will extend the exponential random graph modeling techniques that have been largely used to estimate structural dependencies in relatively small (typically no larger than 500) one-dimensional networks. The proposed project will extend these techniques to multidimensional networks containing over 10,000 nodes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: As cyberinfrastructure is deployed to support collaboration among large communities in government and elsewhere, it is increasingly obvious that social network tools have immense potential. In this project the researchers will seek to respond to the refrain 'if only the Tobacco Surveillance Epidemiology Evaluation Network knew what it knew.' Generalizing the relevance of this same refrain to a wide spectrum of other contexts is suggestive of the broader impacts of the proposed research. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately generalizable to the design and deployment of social network referral tools to support collaboration among other digital government efforts within public health and beyond. Further, the government and non-government partners in this project are exceptionally well-equipped to incorporate into their regularly scheduled education, training, and outreach workshops the skill sets of collaborative fluency afforded by the judicious use of network referral systems. Finally, by definition, social network referral systems have the potential to increase the likelihood of drawing in more diverse constituents within the public health community (in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, seniority, disciplinary perspectives) than heretofore possible. This extended network will also offer opportunities for mentoring of previously disadvantaged members within these communities."

It is intended as a contribution to linguistic geography, empirical dialectology, and computational geography. Conventional methods of quantitative spatial analysis have been found to be ill-suited to analyze the Linguistic Atlas of Middle and South Atlantic States (LAMSAS) databases accumulated over several decades of extensive field work. Thus, the project will employ a neural network model, called Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), which has never been used to analyze linguistic data, and the study will be a test of the robustness of SOM on geographic problems. The following specific linguistic and dialectologic questions will be addressed:<br/>1. How are linguistic features (whether words, grammatical constructions, pronunciations, or combinations of the latter) distributed over geographic areas, if not in relatively uniform patterns of complementary distribution?<br/>2. Are the configuration and density of the road network critical elements of the creation and shaping of dialectal regions?<br/>3. Since individual linguistic features can be shown to have specific distributions in geographic space, are there some relatively small group of linguistic features that can be perceived as most ""salient"" in the identification of regional differences? <br/>4. What is the congruence between isoglosses posited by traditional, subjective methods for simple linguistic features (lexical, pronunciation, or grammatical) and the ""fuzzy"" multidimensional clusters derived from SOMs?<br/>5. What is the interaction of personal/social variables such as sex, age, ethnicity, occupation, and education, with geographic variables such as location and community type (urban/rural)?<br/><br/>The project is an empirical study of language variation across geographic areas and socio-demographic groups conducted on the largest digital database of language features in North America. Traditional dialectologists have assumed that there were such things as regional dialects and that they only needed to find diagnostic linguistic features to demonstrate the presence and boundaries of the dialect areas. The primary tool of traditional dialectologists was the isogloss, which was supposed to represent the geographical limit of occurrence of some linguistic feature; bundles of isoglosses that ran in about the same place were taken to be dialect boundaries. Recently, quantitative approaches have indicated that linguistic variations are considerably more complex. This project will rely on novel computational techniques of data compression to further our understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of language in the distribution of features across territory and social dimensions. By not starting with the assumption of the systematicity of language and dialect that generativists and traditional dialectologists and sociolinguists share (i.e. that all speakers of a language or dialect share essentially the same rules and inventories of linguistic features), this research has the potential to build a multidimensional cultural model in which language is not removed from society as an independent system but instead is well-integrated with other regional and social characteristics."

The studies indicate that calves that experience in utero heat stress are smaller at birth and weaning, have reduced passive immune transfer, and depressed innate immune function. A project designed to further examine the health and performance of cows that experience heat stress during the final 60 days of gestation is currently underway. The availability of calves that experience in utero heat stress under such defined conditions during late gestation presents a unique opportunity to gain further insight into environmental factors that alter neonatal health and development, and possibly induce life-long differences in immune function that alter fitness. RAPID funding of this application is essential to capitalize on this unique opportunity to gain insight into the fundamental biology of heat stress. The first proposed objective is to tease apart the cellular mechanisms responsible for the observed differences in immunoglobulin uptake, and to determine if in utero and early-life differences in immune status persist in later life. Intestinal capacity for immunoglobulin absorption could be reduced by heat stress in utero. That hypothesis will be tested by measuring tissue and cellular levels of IgG absorption and relative levels of apoptosis in neonatal calves from dams that experience heat stress or cooling during late gestation. To more fully assess the long-term impact of in utero heat stress, functional immune endpoints and growth in calves from heat stressed and cooled dams will be compared. Immune suppression observed in heat-stressed cows and/or their calves may also result from differences in their immune cell subsets compared to those that are cooled. To address this possibility, peripheral blood of cows 8 weeks pre- and post-partum and peripheral blood, spleen and thymus of calves sacrificed to address the first objective above will be evaluated by flow cytometry for the frequency of different types of immune cells including B cells, T cells, monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes. A broad understanding of the cellular mechanisms of immune function following in utero heat stress, and the impact on growth and survival to puberty, as an indicator of overall fitness will therefore be developed as a result of this project. <br/>The broader impacts of the proposed study include enhanced understanding of heat stress biology, and the potential to develop management interventions for farmed and captive ruminants with improved capacity to thrive under higher ambient temperatures. To accomplish these goals, continued graduate educational support is necessary. There is also a need to expand the diversity of those trained in the field of animal biology to better represent the general population. Two outstanding young women scientists of Hispanic ethnicity will work on this project as graduate students. The University of Florida also has a significant population of undergraduate students of Hispanic descent and two of those students have been recruited to introduce them to basic research methods, techniques in immunology, and data summary and presentation. The undergraduates will assist with all aspects of the animal care, sample collection, and conduct of immune function assays. Thus the proposal will add significantly to the capacity and diversity of students trained in animal biology at the University of Florida."

Hurricane Andrew presents an immediate situation in which to examine the breakdown, maintenance, or re-organization of social control. This project will explore the impact of the hurriance on law and informal social control in the Miami area. Observations and interviews with law enforcement officials and residents will be conducted in areas of major impact from the hurricane. The selected sites will provide variations in class and ethnicity of the affected populations and degree of destruction in the affected areas. Supplemental interviews will be conducted with University of Florida students whose homes are in the hurricane-affected areas. The research is guided by Black's theory of the behavior of law and routine activities theory of crime. The aim is to explore the interaction for formal and informal control and the extent to which social control breaks down or is maintained under disaster conditions. Not only will many questions of theoretical significance to understanding social control be explored but the research has immediate practical implications for policy and planning in the wake of such disasters."

These networks can accelerate the transmission of information, facilitate innovation, and enhance systems of mutual assistance, although they can also limit access to new information or discourage learning if participation is dependent on specific characteristics like ethnicity or religion, if the network hierarchy is vertical, or if contacts are limited to a small, highly cohesive group. By analyzing entrepreneurial networks, geographers and other social scientists obtain new insights into the cultural, political, and social contexts of economic systems and economic development. This doctoral dissertation research project will use case studies of two entrepreneurial networks in and around Mwanza in northern Tanzania to characterize the conventions shaping interactions within the networks; to identify the bases of legitimacy affecting who participates in the network; to determine the importance of these networks for entrepreneurial innovation; to assess the levels of trust influencing the depth of relationships in the network; and to correlate business performance with network participation. In-depth, semi-standardized interviews will be conducted with entrepreneurs in each network and field observations will be made of their business practices. Statistical correlations will test the significance of relationships among enterprise, entrepreneur, and network characteristics, firm performance, and firm innovation, while qualitative analyses will detail significant social, cultural, political, and external influences on the networks and social relationships between entrepreneurs. This research will increase knowledge of how small enterprise entrepreneurial networks relate to Tanzanian society and what role they have played in the success of economic development policies. Beyond the Tanzanian context, the project will contribute to understandings of the potential for independent development in sub-Saharan Africa and will enhance insights into the role of social institutions in economic transformations. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

Virtual reality (VR) is a multidisciplinary field involving human-centered computer simulations that seek to imitate or augment real world senses (usually sight, sound, and touch) and experiences. VR research includes developing and assessing methods and systems, and facilitating and understanding user perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors. First organized by the IEEE Computer Society in 1993, IEEE Virtual Reality is the premier international conference and exhibition in this field and includes prestigious technical paper presentations, workshops, tutorials, research demonstrations, and exhibits from industry. Based on prior year numbers, IEEE VR 2013 expects over 300 registrants, 20 exhibitors, and 30 student volunteers. More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.ieeevr.org/2013. <br/><br/>Inspired by broad student interest and successful events at past CHI and ISMAR conferences, this will be the first Doctoral Consortium associated with IEEE Virtual Reality. The schedule includes a pre-event dinner where the students can meet and encourage each other socially, followed by a day-long private workshop where they each present their work to a panel of senior VR researchers and receive specific constructive feedback. Each student will prepare a poster on his/her research, (which will also be on display during the conference as part of the poster presentations), and will have a total of 50 minutes for a presentation during the workshop, of which approximately 20 minutes is reserved for an extensive discussion with the other graduate student participants and the senior researchers. Discussions will be run freely but will be facilitated by the DC co-chairs and mentors, who will address the strengths of the work, challenges and issues that may arise, and implications of the results. Talk titles and abstracts, along with the procedures followed, will be archived in an IEEE VR 2013 binder as a reference for the following year's conference.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide an interactive and supportive mentoring opportunity for mid-level graduate students in virtual reality, to afford these students a valuable opportunity to get independent perspectives on their research from senior individuals with a wide collective breadth and depth of knowledge, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the VR community. The organizers will take steps to achieve diversity among the students with respect to research topics, disciplinary backgrounds, methodological approaches, and home institutions (no more than one graduate student will be accepted from any one institution). Factors such as gender and ethnicity will also be taken into account, with an emphasis on including underrepresented groups."

The proposed research examines whether identity development is key to understanding these educational and developmental trajectories. Although research has shown that the establishment of a clear and positive identity during emerging adulthood is associated with a variety of optimal outcomes, many questions remain regarding how identity is formed, particularly with regard to developing a positive science identity and a sense of belonging with one's STEM field. The overarching goal of the current project is to better understand how identity forms during college by applying a narrative approach, in which identity is understood as developing through a subjective process of integrating life experiences into a personal and self-defining story. Specifically, the unique vantage point of narratives will be used to better understand why some students -- especially women, underrepresented minorities, and those with disadvantaged backgrounds -- disengage from pursuing STEM-related careers while others persist. By combining objective markers (e.g., gender, ethnicity, SES, educational background) with coded narratives that emerge in response to relevant experiences (e.g., in the science classroom), this study may contribute to solutions for the persistent lack of diversity in the sciences. More broadly, by examining how students engage in meaning-making about the critical transitions (e.g., leaving home, choosing a major) and contextualized experiences (e.g., academic, social, romantic) that are central to college life, the proposed research will identify the identity pathways that contribute to increases over time in other important outcomes, including maturity, happiness, and clarity of career goals.<br/><br/>The Identity Pathways Project is a five-year, two-campus longitudinal study that utilizes a quantitative narrative approach. The longitudinal design involves three surveys annually for four years and a final survey one year after graduation. The surveys will include repeated assessments of both narratives (transition to college, academic and relational high and low points, experiences related to major choice and future career) and standard scales of the outcomes of interest. With this design, the proposed research will be able to test the extent to which identity processes operate as mechanisms of developmental change, and more specifically, whether narratives reflecting a positive science identity are a key factor in persistence along a STEM-related career path. The two-campus design, which includes a private liberal arts college and a state university, increases the demographic diversity and allows for a more inclusive examination of identity development, especially as it pertains to career identity and STEM participation. The narrative approach to career identity has important implications for designing career counseling programs, especially those promoting STEM-related career paths among women and minorities."

To understand STEM expectations of success and interests in pursuing STEM careers, it is imperative to understand the achievement-related choices people make when deciding what areas to study and what careers to pursue. If mentoring is to be used to its fullest capacity in increasing students' interest in pursuing STEM careers, it is imperative to delineate what type of mentoring is most effective in increasing STEM self-efficacy and achievement-related choices.<br/><br/>This proposal is addressing the following research questions: ""Can a general 'best practices' mentoring approach be effective or is a specific self-efficacy approach needed? Is a combination of the two approaches optimal? In addition, does student ethnicity moderate the impact of the mentoring approaches?"" Forty-eight teams of approximately 480 male and female participants represent middle school classes that have not previously participated in robotics or a similar STEM activity. Team mentors are divided into those receiving best-practices mentor training, self-efficacy mentor training, a combination, and no mentor training (control group). All teams participate in a Botball regional robotics competition organized by the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics. Employing a mixed factorial design, the study examines three types of mentor training for their impact on STEM self-efficacy and expectations of success and/or STEM achievement-related choices. The results along with the feedback from mentors will be used to develop a mentor-training package that could be used in all robotics programs and be generalized to other similar STEM activities.<br/><br/>This proposal focuses on students who have not participated in a previous robotics competition and are not 'self-selected' (i.e. have not already voluntarily enrolled in a robotics competition). Therefore, the research will inform the field if the experience itself generated a disposition to pursue STEM without the confounding factor that the participants were already so inclined before the study began."

Visualization, or the use of interactive graphics to support data analysis and understanding, has become an integral part and critical component of many application areas. IEEE VIS is the premier forum for advances in scientific and information visualization; this weeklong event convenes an international community of researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to explore their shared interests in tools, techniques, and technology, and is now attended by over 1,000 visualization professionals from around the world. The papers presented at the various component events are rigorously refereed and widely cited. More information is available online at http://www.ieeevis.org. The Doctoral Colloquium at IEEE VIS, a research-focused meeting which has taken place annually since 2006, has been highly successful in providing a forum for introducing and grooming young scholars in the field. Many of today's leading visualization researchers have participated in earlier doctoral colloquia as students. The event brings together the best of the next generation of visualization researchers and allows them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession. Since the students and faculty are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, gender, ethnicity, scientific discipline, institution, and research specialization), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development. The organizers strongly commit to achieving diversity among the student participants; to this end, no more than 2 students will be accepted from any one institution, and 2 students from the same institution will only be accepted if at least one of them is a woman. The PI has further affirmed that NSF funds will be used chiefly to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States.<br/><br/>In 2015 the workshop will convene on Saturday, October 24 (the day before the main conference), with follow-up events throughout the week during the VIS technical program. A primary objective is to allow students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders and with their peers, who will provide helpful feedback and fresh perspectives. To this end, the 18 students will be split into three groups of 6 students; two faculty panelists and one DC co-chair will be assigned to each group in individual meeting rooms to hold their presentations. Each student will be allotted approximately 30-40 minutes of time during the group sessions, to include a formal presentation about his/her doctoral research followed by in-depth discussions and feedback. All students will be assigned a specific mentor among the expert panelists, who will be responsible for reading the student's submission materials in particular depth and providing detailed feedback; additional feedback will be given by other members of the faculty panel, as well as by fellow student participants. Discussion is encouraged. The feedback is geared to helping student participants understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other visualization research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, whether their results are being appropriately analyzed and presented, etc. The goal is to give a second opinion on each student's doctoral research beyond the guidance provided by the student's own dissertation advisor. There will be a common catered working lunch on site for all participants (students and panelists alike) where students get an additional opportunity to meet and network with the expert panelists on a more individual level. Finally, at the end of the day, there will be a roundtable discussion where all participants meet and discuss higher-level topics beyond technical research. Student research will be disseminated via posters during the VIS technical program, and via publication in the VIS Extended Abstracts. The organizers will file a final report (with feedback from participants) which will be archived by the VIS Executive Committee and provided to the organizers of future doctoral colloquia."

Developing the resources that enable these technologies has usually required a substantial investment -- both monetarily and in terms of trained native speakers -- meaning that without new strategies, most of the 7,000+ languages in the world would likely remain resource-poor and their speakers underserved. This project addresses the problem of bootstrapping linguistic resources required for language technologies in low-resource languages more economically by identifying cross-linguistic correspondences between high- and low-resource languages and projecting resources (e.g., translations, lexical ontologies, and syntactic annotations) accordingly. To identify these correspondences, this work develops computational models of linguistic borrowing, which is the process by which words from a donor language are adapted by speakers of a recipient language as a result of language contact and bilingualism. In addition to enabling the transfer of resources from high- to low-resource languages, being able to identify borrowing enables corpus-based studies of the social factors (power differences between countries, public opinion, and personal attributes such as geographic location, gender, and race/ethnicity) that have been identified as correlates with which words are borrowed. Thus, by observing language change, this work enables changes in social relations to be quantified.<br/><br/>Words are not left unchanged by the process of borrowing, and modeling this process is the central challenge to identifying instances of borrowing. Fortunately, the adaptation processes are generally regular and amenable to computational modeling, and this work uses weighted finite-state transducers parameterized with features derived from Optimality Theory (OT). OT-derived features not only provide increased statistical efficiency relative to conventional linguistically naive statistical models but they also provide a new kind of corpus-based verification of some of the central claims of phonological theory. The borrowing model identifies lexical correspondences across dozens of typologically representative language pairs (primary text data is obtained from open resources such as Wikipedia, Twitter, blogs, and online news), enabling projection of resources and development of core natural language processing technologies. Finally, the borrowing model enables instances of borrowed words to be identified in text as it is generated over time, enabling corpus-based sociolinguistic studies."

On the one hand, science research is seen as an economic driver for the communities where it is produced. The successes of Silicon Valley in Northern California, the Route 128 corridor around Boston MA, the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, and the clusters of small tech startups in Austin TX are often attributed to the scientific research produced in these communities. On the other hand, science is often viewed as being primarily ""ivory tower,"" with limited practical value. A quantitative understanding of the economic spillovers from science is critical for policy makers from the state and local levels to the national level seeking to set science-funding levels. Despite this policy interest, there is surprisingly little work quantifying the economic benefits of science. This project provides such estimates, showing what results we should expect from science and research spending in cities across the nation.<br/><br/>In addition to leading directly to valuable inventions, scientific activity is believed to raise productivity in the communities where it is performed. This project focuses on these productivity spillovers. Our understanding of these economic spillovers from science is not very good yet, at least in part because there are three significant challenges to estimating the spillover benefits of science. Specifically:<br/><br/>(1) Cities like Boston and San Francisco, where a large amount of research is performed, may be inherently different from cities with a small amount of research. Such differences are likely to lead researchers to misstate the spillover benefits from science, attributing to ""science in the city"" what is really attributable to the city itself. <br/><br/>(2) The typical person living in a city with a lot of scientific activity may be more productive than the typical person in other cities. For instance, a large amount of science is produced by universities, which clearly generate skills for their students and may attract highly productive workers. Such differences would tend to lead researchers to overstate the spillover benefits of science.<br/><br/>(3) If research raises productivity in a city, it would be natural to expect workers to move to that city and for the city to expand. An inflow of workers to cities with more scientific activity but not more jobs will depress wages, however, leading researchers to understate the spillovers from science.<br/><br/>This project includes all of these effects in estimating the economic spillovers from science. We relate wages, real-estate prices, and other important economic outcomes in a city to measures of scientific activity there. We exploit a wide range of strategies to address all three of the challenges that have frustrated previous research, including developing a general framework in which they can be addressed. We will also produce rich data on scientific activity that will be available for future research. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>These estimates will help policymakers value the economic benefits generated by science to fine-tune science investments. The project will specifically determine how scientific activity affects underrepresented groups based on gender, race, ethnicity, and age. The strategy developed under this project can also be applied to estimate the benefits of science stimulus spending and evaluate which expenditures produced the most benefits."

The MURR Archaeometry Laboratory is one of the most comprehensive US-based laboratories dedicated to chemical characterization studies of archaeological materials. The analytical techniques available at MURR include neutron activation analysis (NAA), inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) of solutions using high resolution and quadrupole instruments, laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS), and conventional- and portable-XRF. These multi-analytical/multi-elemental techniques permit the quantification of major, minor and trace elements simultaneously and with considerable accuracy and precision in a wide range of archaeological materials. <br/><br/>The MURR facility also plays an important role in training students in the advantages and disadvantages of applying specific analytical techniques to archaeological questions. Frequently, archaeology students are invited to spend time on site visiting the Missouri laboratory where they are taught a variety of methods for interpreting archaeological data and have direct access to the large compositional databases containing more than 70,000 previous analyses of pottery, obsidian, and chert by INAA. Online access to these databases is continuing to be developed and improved for integration with databases from other laboratories.<br/><br/>In addition to continued support of student and senior archaeology research projects, Dr. Glascock will also work toward the development of calibration standards and analytical procedures that facilitate the integration of data from multiple analytical techniques (e.g., INAA, ICP-MS, XRF). This effort will benefit both new and mature analytical programs involved in archaeometric compositional analysis research. Dr. Glascock and his colleagues also will continue to oversee the development and application of LA-ICP-MS to archaeological materials and will facilitate the development of portable-XRF for archaeometric research. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this grant are that elemental data generated in collaboration with colleagues and students will be continue to be used to address important topics related to past human and social dynamics, such as, mobility patterns and migrations of people, cultural responses to conflict and stress, community social organization, the development of craft production and specialization, and the creation and maintenance of social boundaries and identity. Compositional data also can improve understanding of ancient technologies and (through analysis of skeletal remains) can provide insight into prehistoric diet and nutrition."

The researcher focuses on empathy and immigration for three reasons. First, immigration as a policy area is unresolved, is extremely salient, and influences the lives and quality of life of millions of people. Second, much of public opinion on immigration is divided along party lines, which presents a difficult test case for learning and opinion change. If empathy affects the motivational, learning, and opinion change processes on immigration opinion, its potential impact may be even greater in policy arenas that are not as divisive. Third, this project fills major gaps in scholarly work on emotion and immigration opinion. To date, scholarship has only explored the effects of anxiety, threat, anger, and enthusiasm on political opinions. This project advances knowledge by providing first-cut research into the impact of empathy on immigration opinion. In addition, this research explores how empathy affects not only immigration policy preferences but also the considerations (e.g., beliefs about immigrants) that people draw upon to form policy opinions. <br/><br/>The project addresses three chief research questions. How does empathy towards immigrants affect information seeking, political learning, and opinion change? Are these effects moderated by ethnicity and partisanship? How long and to what extent do these empathic effects endure? To assess these questions, the researcher conducts an experiment to measure the effects of increased feelings of empathy toward undocumented immigrants on individual learning, reason giving, and immigration policy opinion. The project uses real-world news articles to increase subject empathy and survey self-report questions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of this understudied emotion on the issue of immigration. The expectation is that that empathy motivates information-seeking behavior, enhances the prospects for political learning, and ultimately changes even hardened opinions such as those on immigration. It is also posited that the effects of empathy depend on a person's race and partisanship. This project innovates by using a survey to follow up on its experiments in order to estimate whether the immediate impact of specific emotions on opinion are temporary or has more lasting effects. <br/><br/>This research makes several broader contributions. The project sheds light on how citizens think about divisive issues. Moreover, the project enhances understanding of the impact of emotion on public opinion."

Underrepresented minorities hold multiple identities reflecting race, ethnicity, gender, social roles, family roles, and career (e.g., scientist, engineer). These identities often conflict and, consequently, influence their choices, persistence, and success during the graduate years. This research project builds on social identity theory to understand the process of identity integration for underrepresented minority graduate students in STEM programs as they integrate into a community of practice. Identity integration is essential for lasting success. Little is known, however, about how multiple identities of underrepresented minorities in STEM conflict, intersect, and integrate as participants become productive members of a STEM community of practice.<br/><br/>Using a mixed-methods approach, this research traces the experiences of underrepresented minority graduate students in order to understand their negotiation of multiple, and often conflicting, identities as they progress through their STEM graduate programs. Pre- and post-surveys will measure changes in identity centrality and scientist-identity-interference. Multiple, regularly-scheduled interviews will assess the process of identity negotiation as graduate students become members of their disciplinary communities of practice. Social network analysis will document peer, colleague, advisor, and other support networks that URM graduate students construct as they become members of their disciplinary community of practice in STEM. Participants will be graduate students in STEM graduate programs at three PWIs. Studying these students over time will enable comparisons of identity integration, identity negotiation, and social networking. Collectively, these data will inform the development of a model for underrepresented minority STEM graduate student identity integration that identifies specific strategies for institutional support needed to promote successful assimilation into a STEM disciplinary community of practice."

The 2008-present Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) infestation of central Massachusetts poses a greater stress on ecosystem services, as well as response groups ranging from federal/state resource managers to local residents, than any previous ALB outbreak in other localities due to the predominance of favorable host-species and the finely inter-connected nature of urban-rural forests as well as the presence of a competitive interaction at the federal-stakeholder-neighborhood level surrounding how the infestation should be treated and understood. Unanswered questions abound regarding the level of ALB impact at social and ecological levels. This REU Site renewal project is built on 12 years of success engaging undergraduate researchers at Clark University with the Human-Environment Regional Observatory--Massachusetts (HERO-MA) program on land change/vulnerability studies, which followed the REU Site approach (Polsky et al., 2007) since its inception, and as an official REU Site since 2008.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The Beetle Impact Assessment stream produces validated measures of spatial and temporal changes in tree cover composition in the ALB-infestation area.

From the reverse perspective ""outlying"" communities can function most successfully if they can determine how best to take advantage of their incorporation into a broader social system. Archaeological research has the potential to examine such interactions over extended periods of time and such is the goal of this research project. Under the guidance of Dr. Marc Bermann, Francisco Garrido will explore two factors underlying the success of the ancient Inca empire: its imperial infrastructure (the famous road system), and its impact at household and local levels in subject territories. Taking a ""bottom up"" perspective on the effects of Inca conquest on mining in the Atacama desert of Chile, the research will investigate localized responses to articulation with the imperial system. This research will address this topic through investigation of the relationship between the Inca Road, and a recently discovered, non-Inca, mining camp, isolated in the Atacama Desert. Preliminary research suggests that this camp could not have existed without use of the nearby Inca road, leading to two, inter-related, research objectives: (1) evaluating the extent to which the Inca Road functioned as an unrecognized growth factor, stimulating local craft industry; and (2) assessing whether the Inca Road served as a linear entrepot or exchange nexus, rather than simply as a highway servicing Inca imperial needs. A one-year project of survey, surface collection, and excavation will document: the nature of mining at Chinchilla and the use of a nearby section of the Inca Road. In the past, just as today, a major road can serve as an powerful economic stimulus or magnet, making possible economic enterprises along it that were not feasible previously. <br/><br/>By connecting local Atacama populations to a much wider socioeconomic world, the research will be addressing issues of ""globalization,"" albeit, using this prehistoric case study. One area of investigation is to document how people chose to use a new and foreign infrastructure (even one that represented imperial hegemony) to their own ends. Part-time, supplemental, or seasonal mining as a small scale kin-based activity with low capital investment is still common in many parts of the world today, including South America, and its organization and goals can be very similar to prehispanic examples. A better understanding of the history and dynamics of small scale mining in the Atacama remains relevant today, where there is still a juxtaposition of large, profit-driven, multinational mining operations and community based, risk minimizing, community-level mining. The theoretical issues addressed in this research thus parallel contemporary issues discussed in Chile today about mining and household and community autonomy, resource access and utilization, and economic coping strategies. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include documenting understudied components of the archaeological heritage in the Atacama Desert - increasingly a tourist destination. Chilean students from several universities will participate in the fieldwork, and receive training in current survey and excavation techniques. Collections will be stored at the Regional Museum of Atacama, and available, with complete documentation, to other students and scholars. An important component of the research will be working with existing museum collections and with unpublished reports, bringing data from these hidden sources to public light. The project will result in Mr. Garrido's dissertation, and the findings will be disseminated through the Center for Comparative Archaeology electronic data base, conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications."

This phenomenon is more pronounced among young people in low-income communities than elsewhere. Many summer, out-of-school STEM programs are designed to offer young people opportunities to engage in hands-on, inquiry-based learning that promote interest and engagement in STEM. Research on the effect of these types of programs is limited, however. This research project seeks to fill this gap by identifying and studying practices that promote interest and engagement in STEM-related topics. <br/><br/>The central goal of the summer STEM Interest and Engagement Study is to identify instructional practices associated with cultivating and sustaining young people's interest and engagement in out-of-school STEM summer learning programs for middle school youth. The project is based on a model of change developed from existing theory and empirical research on the cultivation of youths' interest and engagement in STEM. The project is a descriptive study that will apply multiple data collection and analytic methods, including the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), to determine instructional practices and the resulting interest, engagement, and perceptions of youth as they participate in STEM activities. In addition, survey data provided by program participants will allow the researchers to account for individual differences in preexisting interest and background factors, such as gender and ethnicity, and to measure changes in dispositions toward STEM. By better understanding these connections, practitioners can better understand how the design of their programs may influence the outcome of the participants' experience, including their education and career decisions."

The long-term goal of this project is to engage the engineering community, particularly engineers and engineering students with disabilities, in activities that will facilitate the entry and advancement of engineers with disabilities and thus increase the representation of engineers with disabilities in public and private sector workforce as well as in academia. <br/>To achieve this goal, AAAS is proposing to: <br/><br/>Convene a workshop where a diverse group of engineers and engineering students can share their unique approaches to succeeding in academic and professional environments as they overcome physical, sensory, communication, and attitudinal roadblocks. <br/><br/>Collect the strategies and tools used by successful engineers to navigate the traditional barriers that discourage and prevent individuals with early onset or acquired disabilities to enter the engineering profession <br/><br/>Develop and publish workshop findings and recommendations, thus providing a resource specific to the engineering community. <br/><br/>Disseminate the post-workshop report to students, deans, faculty, employers, counselors, parents, and engineering societies. Each of these groups has an important role to play in encouraging or discouraging a person with a disability to participate in the engineering profession. These stakeholders, gatekeepers, and gate-openers are significant not only for the middle or high school student with a disability who cares about 'what works,' but also for the early career engineer who becomes adventitiously disabled from a road accident or sequelae of a disability like multiple sclerosis. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Outreach to underrepresented groups in engineering has focused almost exclusively on minorities and women. Except for an occasional token photograph of a person in a wheelchair, publications and programs designed to strengthen the pathway to engineering education and careers for precollege and postsecondary students have not included students or working engineers with disabilities. This proposed project will expand the work of the NSF focus on broadening participation in engineering. <br/>The typical workshop on persons with disabilities presents one or very few individuals reporting on their success in education or employment. The Problem Solvers Workshop will have a completely different dimension, assembling 60 selected engineers and engineering students, diverse in gender, ethnicity, geography, current age and age of onset of disability, field of engineering, and sector of employment. <br/>As the title of the Workshop suggests, engineers with disabilities focus on problem solving in their professional lives and also in their personal lives. As individuals with disabilities, each participant has developed his or her unique approach to overcoming barriers or the limitations presented by their disability. These insights will add to ongoing research on universal design; it can also contribute to adaptations of existing assistive technology to fit the dimensions of the specific engineering field, job requirements, or individual needs."

Investigating the encounter between Tibetan and Chinese Buddhists in the post-Communist era, this research poses the following questions: Why have Tibetan monks included Han Chinese (the dominant Chinese ethnicity) in their revival of Buddhism? Why have so many urban Chinese abandoned the secularist worldview cultivated by the state to convert to Tibetan Buddhism? Li addresses the questions by looking into a tradition in the Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism, known as gter. Gter is an indigenous term for exploration that brings together the domains of landscape, materiality, human wayfaring and new religious imagination and interpretation. It has eventually formed new Buddhist subjects who weave together the religious ties between Tibet and China. <br/><br/>This research will involve a combination of ethnographic methods: participant observation, semi-structured interviews, archival research, analysis of conversion narratives and focus groups. The goal of these investigations is to understand how the religious domain created by treasure hunting can be seen as an assembly, which gradually comes into being through encounters between humans and things. In doing so, it will increase social scientific understanding of the relationship between subject formation, as indicated in conversion, and the broader material world. <br/><br/>This research is important because it will provide a new way for theorizing religion in anthropology. It will also provide data on the newly emerged interaction between Tibetan and Chinese Buddhists, a phenomenon that can give a different way to imagine the fraught relationships between Tibet and China. Given the 60 year history of the Tibet-China conflict and ongoing disputes about who leads Tibetan Buddhism, the phenomena of secularist Chinese converting to Tibetan Buddhism has wide-ranging implications. At a time when the Chinese economy is increasingly dependent on a capitalist model at odds with the fundamental premise of communism, it is important to understand the growing conversion of secularist Chinese to any religion, particularly one tied so closely to political independence of a disputed territory. Supporting this research also supports the education of a graduate student."

UM is establishing a University-level SEEDS office as a focus for diversity programs across all three UM campuses, establishing a Best Practices Committee to assess equity in policies, funding an Interactive Theatre initiative to help educate academic populations in diversity issues, and sponsoring a comprehensive climate survey to identify gender and ethnicity issues at UM. The SEEDS office will orchestrate initiatives, develop a comprehensive website and work with the Best Practices Committee to educate departments, department chairs and search committees on diversity issues, efforts funded by UM. NSF funding will support seven programs, including five based on proven programs: SEEDS Networking, Senior Scholar Lectureships, Career Workshops, ""You Choose"" Leadership Opportunities and Mentoring Across Differences, and two novel programs: ""Early Career Research Conferences"" and ""Working From Within For Departmental Transformation"". These strategies draw from an extensive literature on gender and race equity in science and engineering to effectively recruit women and underrepresented minorities actively.<br/><br/>Taken together, these programs and activities capitalize on a critical period of faculty replacement and expansion at UM, when catalyzing recruitment and retention initiatives can significantly increase faculty diversity. The opportunity is substantial: UM now has 302 SEM faculty and anticipates more than 100 tenure-track SEM faculty searches in the next five years. UM is located in Miami, the gateway to the Americas, where the Hispanic success story is palpable at every turn, and where our undergraduates are 27% Hispanic and 10% African-American. However, our Science, Engineering and Mathematics faculty has only 5% underrepresented minorities. We thus have a substantial eagerness for recruiting and retaining women of color. Because Miami is particularly attractive for Hispanic peoples and since several of our research fields have a strong pipeline representation of Hispanic women, we expect a good measure of success in our efforts to learn about, celebrate, promote, recruit and retain Hispanic women. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: SEEDS innovatively combines a focus on underrepresented minorities with proven and novel programs to both broadly engage an entire university community, and focally transform target departments. Novel ""Early Career Research Conferences"" showcase young women and underrepresented minority scientists in cutting edge research conferences, thereby directly promoting their careers and highlighting them for local and national searches. A novel ""Working from Within"" program combines an initiative to educate department chairs with an administrative advocacy and financial support of selected women faculty leaders who are armed with a ""Transformational Toolkit"" to remedy specific concerns within their own departments. <br/><br/>Broader impact: SEEDS will alleviate isolation, foster career development, educate the academic community and infuse changes in hiring and promotion institution-wide with a high probability of improved climate as well as increased hiring and retention of women and underrepresented scientists during a critical period of faculty expansion."

Specifically, statistical logistic regression, classification tree, and recently developed random forest techniques will be applied to a sample of students admitted to Texas Tech University. Once accomplished, these techniques will classify the variables and yield a predictive model for student recruitment to study engineering.

Nguyen <br/>Institution: University of Kansas<br/>Proposal Number: 0651758<br/>Title: WATER MANAGEMENT IN PEM FUEL CELLS BY MATERIAL ENGINEERING<br/><br/>Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells depend on proper water management to obtain high power density and energy efficiency. During operation water is dragged from the anode to the cathode by electro-osmosis leading to dehydration at the anode. Concurrently, in addition to water being transported from the anode by electro-osmosis, water is also generated at the cathode by the oxygen reduction reaction. When the water created in the cathode by these processes is not properly removed, its accumulation leads to poor fuel cell performance because it blocks the gas pores used for oxygen transport and forms an additional transport barrier over the reactive area. Traditionally, water management has been addressed by system engineering, i.e., by adding auxiliary systems to the basic fuel cell system to provide humidification to the anode and removal of water from the cathode. This approach has added significant complexities (e.g. reliability and durability) and costs to the system. Furthermore, these auxiliary systems reduce the net power output of the fuel cell system leading to lower conversion efficiency.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/><br/>Recent development and understanding of the functions of some of the components used in a PEM fuel cell have led to a paradigm shift as to how water management can be implemented in a PEM fuel cell. It is believed that if materials with the right properties and the correct electrode configuration are used, the water transported to the cathode by electro-osmosis can be forced back through the membrane to the anode to achieve the condition of zero-net-water-transport-across-the membrane in a PEM fuel cell. This approach eliminates the need for anode gas humidification and minimizes the water removal requirement at the cathode, allowing the PEM fuel cell system to be greatly simplified. These are the intellectual merits of this work.<br/><br/>To achieve the objective stated above in a more efficient manner, a combined approach of theoretical (modeling) and experimental work is planned. Experiments will be conducted to measure the two-phase transport properties of the key components used in the membrane-and-electrode assembly (MEA) of a PEM fuel cell. The results will be used to develop correlations of the relationship between the morphological and wetting properties and the two-phase transport properties of these components. Experiments will also be conducted to develop a four-phase (electronic-ionic-gas-liquid) micro-structure for the catalyst layer used in PEM fuel cell that is optimal for two-phase (liquid and gas) transport. Concurrently, a mathematical model of a complete MEA of a PEM fuel cell that incorporates the two-phase transport properties obtained from the experiments above will be developed. Once the model's predictions are validated experimentally, the model will be used in an optimization study to determine the electrode configuration and the morphological and surface properties of the components needed to achieve the zero-net-water-transport-across-the-membrane condition in a PEM fuel cell. Based on the optimization results new components will be developed and tested in a PEM fuel cell to validate that the condition of zero-net-water-transport-across-the-membrane is achieved.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/><br/>First, this approach of using materials engineering to achieve optimal water management should significantly lower the complexities and costs of the PEM fuel cell system and help accelerate the commercialization of this technology. Second, the results of this work are expected to have impacts in other areas at both the basic and applied science levels. The understanding of multi-phase transport in porous media is applicable in areas such as geology, nuclear engineering and petroleum engineering. The PI also plans to continue recruiting undergraduate and graduate students of various backgrounds, genders and ethnicity in his research team. His efforts to introduce fuel cell technology to the undergraduate education are well recognized by the educational tools (experimental and literature) created by a company that he founded."

Intellectual Merit: In focusing on student perceptions about mentoring, this project represents preliminary work on untested ideas that are novel in being outside the mainstream of research in engineering education in focusing on student perceptions of a co-curricular activity related to their academic studies and career plans. We propose to work with an advisory group of other researchers on this project to shape and implement a study which will provide information useful for both understanding student perceptions and communicating to students effectively information about opportunities available to them to meet their needs.<br/><br/>Mentoring has been identified as a very important component of students' learning experiences, and in many cases, essential to retention, particularly for women and students of color, but is not part of the usual focus of curricular design, and classroom learning. To confound efforts to understand the role and potential effectiveness of mentoring, in an effort to tap into its benefits to student learning and retention, the term is frequently left undefined in context. So to prescribe mentoring as a solution for a problem leaves educators uncertain about what aspects of a mentoring relationship are important to replicate in order to gain its positive benefits for retention. Thus, through this exploratory research project, we will to learn more about students' perceptions of the value and need for mentors, and particularly how these perceptions might vary depending upon the student's year in school, or other factors such as gender, ethnicity, age, type of institution, etc."

A novel, hierarchical and active manufacturing process in which highly monodisperse nanoparticles can be produced in a continuous and robust fashion will be developed. The method centers on recent microfluidic emulsification methods, but exploits the presence of surfactants at liquid-liquid interfaces to bring about the formation of droplets orders of magnitude smaller than the host device. Specifically, the tipstreaming phenomenon will be used to produce a continuous stream of submicron droplets. The reactant streams for nanoparticle synthesis will be encapsulated in the resulting submicron droplets, and will subsequently react to form highly monodisperse nanoparticles (1-10 nm) within the droplets. Two key advantages of using submicron droplets as nanoparticle reactors are that (1) submicron length scales allow for very effective diffusive mixing, minimizing the need for additional mixing schemes and enabling reaction kinetics to be isolated, and (2) resulting tiny reactor volumes lead to limited reactant supply within a single nanoreactor, allowing precise control over the number and size of nanoparticles formed. Furthermore, the ability to easily tune flow and reaction conditions inline in microfluidic devices leads to an inherently active nanoscale process. The fundamental knowledge gained from these studies will significantly contribute to a growing body of knowledge in the area of microreactor and nanoparticle technology. The results of this exploratory research will enable additional nanomanufacturing processes for synthesis of other novel nanostructures, including nano-alloys and nano-clusters controlled by the formation of concentric or sequential droplet reactors, high throughput screening devices for systematic, combinatorial study of nanoparticle chemistries, and the use of nanostructured hydrogels within submicron reactors to enhance nanoparticle uniformity while minimizing aggregation. The broader impacts of this work include the significant potential for the proposed method to realize wide application. In particular, a wide range of possible materials and chemistries can be utilized with this method, and a wide range of novel nanostructures can be synthesized. In addition, educational and outreach activities of the PI's will center on dispelling common misconceptions about nanotechnology, and will utilize the highly visual nature of microfluidics to appeal to audiences that are diverse in age, gender, and ethnicity."

The main goals of the project are to: 1) identify how military veterans fare in hiring, document the extent of differential hiring treatment of veterans and whether such treatment varies by race and gender using an experimental design 2) explore the mechanisms explaining employer treatment of veterans, how employers evaluate military experience, and what meaning military experience holds in the civilian hiring process using in-depth interviews with hiring agents and 3) adjudicate competing sociological explanations for differential veteran/nonveteran employment outcomes, of human capital development, selection, signaling or screening, and cultural capital development on the basis of the audit and interview data. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The research has broad reaching social impacts. First, it contributes to both the academic and practical understanding of veteran hiring practices. Findings will foster development of veteran-friendly transition and employment policies. Evidence of discriminatory hiring practices or negative sentiments toward military job seekers would suggest the need for better employer education on laws protecting military members and better evaluation of compliance with such laws. On the other hand, evidence of preferential treatment could clarify that employment transition difficulties facing veterans lie elsewhere in the hiring or job matching process. The project contributes to the recent University of Kansas-Ft. Leavenworth initiative facilitating collaboration between the University and the Army?s Command and General Staff College by providing information that can be used to aid military policymaking."

Students at three stages in the engineering education pipeline will be studied: before entrance to four-year college programs (i.e., two-year colleges), during college, and in the early years following completion of an undergraduate engineering program. The study will also scan an understudied sector of the engineering pipeline, surveying students in two-year colleges that prepare students for transfer to bachelor's programs. Studying both two- and four-year student populations will enable researchers to focus on students at different points in the pipeline and to explore if and how different aspects of engineering education influence students based on their gender, race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status. Variations in student experiences and perceptions may affect how students learn engineering as well as decisions about whether to study engineering, whether to complete a degree, and whether, ultimately, to become an engineer.<br/><br/>To develop survey instruments, the PIs will conduct an extensive set of interviews with students, faculty members, administrators, and alumni at two universities and their associated two-year feeder colleges. These interviews will be designed to discover factors or forces that shape students' learning and their progress through the postsecondary pipeline, with particular attention to discovering factors currently overlooked or little understood in the current literature, such as students' out-of-class experiences, organizational structures and policies of engineering schools, the faculty culture in engineering programs, how students ""make meaning"" of their coursework, and how they develop perceptions of what engineers do."

Smith (Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College)<br/>Co-PI: Niranjan Baisakh (Louisiana State University Agricultural Center)<br/><br/><br/>Rice is a staple crop that feeds more than two billion people worldwide. Agricultural lands used for growing rice frequently contain sub-optimal nutrient levels. Low availability of two important nutrients, phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe), commonly limits crop productivity, whereas excess Fe can cause toxicity in rice grown under flooding conditions. Because of these growth restraints, plants modulate complex responses to fluctuating P and Fe levels via genome-wide transcriptional regulatory networks that involve numerous genes. DNA is found in the nucleus wrapped around histone proteins into structures known as nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin, which is a fluid, higher-order assembly that is modified by many remodeling complexes. Although chromatin structure plays a substantial role in controlling gene expression, the chromatin-level mechanisms involved in regulating nutrient homeostasis in plants are not well understood. Previous work has shown that the interaction between P and Fe influences the onset of deficiency-induced stress responses. The goal of this project is to identify chromatin-level mechanisms that regulate the uptake, assimilation, and utilization of P and Fe in rice. The four specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine the physiological and transcriptional changes in rice seedlings under P and/or Fe deficiency; 2) identify nutrient deficiency-dependent changes in nucleosome positioning across the rice genome; 3) examine the role of the H2A.Z histone variant in regulating gene expression in rice genome-wide; and 4) characterize the histone post-translational modifications present at rice P and Fe homeostasis genes during nutrient deficiency. By correlating three key components of chromatin structure (i.e. nucleosome positioning, histone variant localization, and histone modifications) with gene expression profiles, the regulatory mechanisms that modulate P and Fe deficiency responses will be revealed. Identifying these chromatin-level mechanisms will provide opportunities for developing crops with improved nutrient use-efficiency, significantly improving U.S. and global agriculture. All sequence data generated during this project will be made available to the public through the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the education of graduate and undergraduate students. The investigators have research groups diverse in ethnicity and gender, and will continue to foster involvement of underrepresented groups in research by mentoring students through programs available through LSU, including the Pre-doctoral Scholars Institute and Noyce Tigers Research Internship. Other planned activities include K-12 outreach through the annual Super Science Saturday event, and training of student-teacher pairs from area high schools in hands-on research for two weeks during the summer."

However, Turkish democracy remains riddled by problems. This research project will focus on civil society in Istanbul, Turkey's largest and most diverse city, as a window into the problem of democratic consolidation in Turkey. Civil society, most often defined as the realm of associational life distinct from both family-life and the state, has been identified as an arena in which values and attitudes that are conducive to democratic governance, such as trust, cooperation and tolerance, are reproduced. In the Middle East, the failure of democracy to take root has often been attributed to the presence of ""weak"" or disorganized civil societies incapable of acting as countervailing forces to strong states, and to the role of Islam in public life. The central research questions of this study concern the form and extent of civil society in Istanbul, the relationship between civil society and the consolidation of democracy, the diversity of modes of participation in civil society across neighborhood contexts and different groups (based on gender, class, ethnicity, migrant status and religion), and the role of Islamist networks as an alternative avenue of public participation. These research questions will be addressed through a multi-method research design that includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. Seventy-five Istanbul neighborhoods will be selected based on the stratification of all municipal neighborhoods using rates of population change (as an indicator of in-migration) and land-value (as an indicator of class-status). A survey will be administered to a random sample (proportionate to population within the sampled neighborhoods) of voting age residents, for a total sample of 4,000 respondents. In the second stage of the project, ten focus groups of population sub-groups (e.g. women, migrants, high socio-economic status residents, Kurds, Alevis etc.) will be used to explore the meaning and implications of differences across groups in their engagement in civil society, their use of urban space, and their relative acceptance of democratic values. Finally, a case study of Islamist networks in the city will be conducted through interviews with Islamist leaders and activists. This final research stage will provide greater insight into how the Islamist networks and associations function in the city. While the survey data will be analyzed using multi-level logistic modeling techniques, the focus groups and interviews will be discursively analyzed to provide qualitative depth to questions of Islam and difference in Istanbul.<br/><br/>This study will offer a new understanding of the architecture of civil society, the variety of associations, relationships, and local contexts that comprise it, and the relationships between Islam, civil society and democracy in Turkey. Democracy in Turkey is of critical human, geopolitical, and theoretical importance. From a Turkish perspective, the consolidation of democracy has been an ongoing goal, not only of the state but also of civil societal elements concerned with human rights and free expression. Turkish democracy is also of international interest, with Turkey's bid to join the European Union hinging on the country's democratic consolidation. Further, as a secular democracy, Turkey is a model for the Muslim-majority countries of the Middle East and Central Asia and. Based on what has so far been established by the civil society literature, it is probable that the future of Turkish democracy will pivot on whether or not democracy takes root in the public sphere, in the values and attitudes of individuals and social groups. This project will be able to offer a clear indication of the level of civil societal activity, its geographical and social distribution, and the relationship between civic engagement (in a range of arenas of civic engagement, including Islamist associational life) and democratic values in Istanbul. This project will contribute to empirical and comparative analyses of the forms and intensity of civil society in different contexts, and to analyses of the relationships between civic engagement, Islamist associational life, and the creation of democratic values. In addition to these empirical contributions, this project will enable the extension of current theories of civil society beyond the historical limitations of Western models, not only by virtue of exploring these relationships in a Muslim-majority society, but also by focusing in the effects of locality, gender and diversity on civic participation and its significance."

The result is that when we talk, we are not only expressing ideas, but also conveying information about our identity and stances. And when we listen, we not only process the linguistic content of the speech stream, but also information about who we are listening to. Recent work has suggested that linguistic and social content are fundamentally interdependent in the cognitive representations and mechanisms involved in speech production and perception: we automatically change the way we produce and interpret linguistic content depending on the social context, and vice versa. For example, listeners will hear the same ambiguous sound between ""s"" and ""sh"" as ""shod"" if they think the speaker is female, but ""sod"" if they think the speaker is male; listeners will rate speakers as more educated if they say ""running"" instead of ""runnin""; listeners will have more trouble understanding English that is paired with an Asian vs. a White face; and speakers change their pronunciation depending on recent speech they heard, and the topic of conversation. Developing a better understanding of the interconnections between social and linguistic information not only informs our theories of language cognition, but can also lead to improvements in cross-cultural communication in industry and education, and computer-mediated communication. <br/><br/>This award will support a conference devoted to Sociolinguistic Variation and Language Processing to take place at Virginia Tech (March 31 - April 2, 2016). The conference will provide a venue where leading researchers from a variety of backgrounds will meet to share cutting-edge work at the intersection of social and linguistic processing, and discuss the implications of this work for linguistic cognition and improving communication. The conference will focus on five key areas of development in the field: sociolinguistic theory, cognitive theory, socio-phonetics, socio-syntax, and the applications of work in this area. The conference organizers will promote participation by graduate and undergraduate students. Organizers will also foster public engagement by developing a website to disseminate key findings from the conference (as well as from this area of enquiry more generally), highlighting the implications for improving communication and cross-cultural understanding."

This program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in an effort to introduce them to scientific research so as to encourage their continued engagement in the nation's scientific research and development enterprise. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects designed especially for the purpose. The REU program is a major contributor to the NSF's goal of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce. The Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) sciences Directorate awarded this REU Site grant to the University of Nebraska ? Lincoln (UNL) in order to stimulate participant interest in social network analysis (SNA) and behavioral health with a focus on minority health disparities. Participants undergo an extensive methodological training in SNA by the project PI while gaining exposure to a range of research topics and potential science research fields. In conjunction with the Minority Health Disparities Initiative (MHDI), they join a collaborative community of transdisciplinary researchers and community health workers from state and local agencies tackling minority health disparities in Nebraska. The expansion of existing REU to Minority Health Disparities is critical for providing students diverse experiences during the summer and expanding the number of students interested in minority health research through innovative methods like social network analysis and culturally sensitive paradigms, such as Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). Research occurs within 8 participating laboratories that are housed in several departments across two UN campuses. The summer program includes training in professionalism and provide individual career mentoring and cohort activities. Building off of existing recruitment strategies employed by UNL?s Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program, the project recruits junior- and senior-level undergraduates from a wide-range of backgrounds, home institutions, ages, gender, and ethnicity, with emphasis on under-represented minority and female students in the Midwest. Participants are encouraged to pursue careers in behavioral health sciences and have opportunities to present the results of their research to both other REU participants and to a wider audience of health practitioners at the annual Nebraska Minority Health Summit, co-sponsored by the Minority Health Disparities Initiative.<br/><br/>Since the late 1990s, a combined focus on social networks and health has had a significant impact on both health research and social science. SNA has emerged as a key analytical lens for sociologists, pushing relational sociology forward at a rapid pace in the last two decades. It has also emerged as a set of general purpose tools and approaches which cross-cut a range of sciences. Without exaggeration, researchers working on networks choose freely among techniques and measures developed from fields as distant as computer security, virology, primatology, and studies of the world-wide-web. Social science, and social network analysis have much to contribute in such a transdiciplinary realm. SNA is among the oldest and most rigorous approaches to network analysis, and one with a rich empirical base. While physicists model human networks as metaphors of more basic physical material, SNA researchers have traditionally sought to draw their abstractions from the actual interaction of human beings. The potential of this approach to influence public health and related fields is already apparent. What is needed now is less borrowing, and more researchers trained across newly interwoven fields. In this program, REU participants learn basic approaches to network SNA and then employ these skills in a range of sponsoring NIH- and NSF-funded research projects at UNL and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) that focus on minority health and health disparities. Network training takes place in a 2 week intensive network science practicum, followed by 8 weeks of participation in an MHDI-affiliated research project. These projects are united by a collective focus on fundamental questions related both to minority health and to broadening participation in minority health, and are currently funded by a range of federal and state sources. The project is co-funded by the EPSCoR program."

However, little is known about the linkages between them and the benefits of combining them to improve upland farming systems and to slow down deforestation. This study proposes to examine the linkages between LKS and AF (1) by documenting folk taxonomy and traditional management practices of trees, food crops, and soils among the Subanun and Visayan farmers in the southwestern Philippines; and (2) by comparing the differential distribution of this technical knowledge by age, gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. The researcher will use archival research, participant observation, informal, and formal interviews to collect primary data. In addition, semantic domain analysis, a linguistic technique, will be used to analyze qualitative data. This study will enhance of our understanding in the linkage of local knowledge systems and agroforestry. This will also make a basic contribution to the study of intracultural variation. The applied significance is its potential contribution to an improved design of agroforestry projects that increase food production of the upland farmers and forest occupants, while slowing down the process of deforestation. *** bert J.

Several recent epidemiologic studies have noted statistical associations between the spatial accessibility of various types of retail food sources such as supermarkets, groceries, convenience stores, and restaurants of all types, and individual characteristics such as weight, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. These studies typically use the proximity of retail food sources to individuals' residences as the measure of accessibility, and often rely on areal units, such as census tracts and zip codes. Assessing accessibility in this manner, however, could result in ecological fallacy. Since most people travel outside of their census tract on a daily basis, the number and types of retail food sources available to individuals residing in the same area could vary widely. <br/><br/>Doctoral student Jay Christian under the guidance of Professor Gary Shannon in the Department of Geography at University of Kentucky will develop a model of accessibility based upon individuals' activity and travel patterns (their activity space) rather than residential location alone. Researchers previously have used travel diaries to study activity and travel behavior, but these require a significant degree of commitment from study participants, and are prone to recall error and other inaccuracies. This study will explore the use of the global positioning system (GPS) to identify participants' activity spaces, and employ a geographic information system (GIS) to assess the number and types of retail food sources located within these spaces. It will thus produce an alternative measure of individual retail food accessibility that does not rely on areal units, nor require the use of travel diaries. This study will recruit 200 residents of a single census tract in Lexington, Kentucky to carry GPS data loggers to track their movements for two workdays. Participants will also complete surveys regarding their socioeconomic, demographic, biometric, and dietary characteristics, and to assess where they purchased food during the GPS data logging period. Reported food purchase locations will be registered against data derived from the GPS data loggers. Using these data, this study will assess the relative utility of a new activity-based model of accessibility compared to previous models, and explore the link between accessibility, food purchasing, and diet.<br/><br/>By addressing the effect of individuals' daily movements on their access to food, this research will contribute to scientific literature addressing the causes of, and potential solutions to, the obesity epidemic in the United States. As such, it will provide insight for policy formulation by multiple government agencies, including those related to public health, transportation, and planning."

The goal of this proposal is to design and implement a 24-credit-hour PNE concentration (with opportunities for international experiences) under the Bachelor of Science in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering (MME) program, which will prepare graduates for advanced, high-tech engineering and manufacturing careers in printed electronics. The PINE TREE Program has established three objectives to achieve its goal: 1) Recruit and prepare lower-division pre-engineering students to pursue a career option in Nanotechnology. 2) Modify, evaluate, and refine upper-division PNE courses to ensure that students are prepared to enter careers in printing nano-engineering. The strategic actions include the assessing and evaluating of the upper-division curricula and refining courses based on assessment results. 3) Integrate research and development into undergraduate education to reinforce the concepts acquired in the PNE curricula. The PINE TREE program builds on nano-scale and pedagogical research that is already established at UTEP, as well as on the newly established program between UTEP and Seokyeong University (SKU) in Seoul, South Korea that offers upper-division PNE courses to SKU students who transfer to UTEP in their junior year. This international collaboration between UTEP and SKU will help advance PNE education in the U.S. and has the potential of serving as a model which can be replicated by other universities and strengthen the U.S. global manufacturing position. <br/><br/>The students who complete the PINE TREE program will be experts in the field of printed electronics and able to manufacture printed electronics in the areas of printable material development, system manufacturing, and development of flexible electronics. Since the UTEP MME Department has an undergraduate student population that is 81% Hispanic and 31% Female, the PINE TREE Program will create a diverse group of engineers with the skills and qualifications needed in industry for printed electronics; the students will be diverse not only in ethnicity and gender, but in educational background. The program also features international collaborations that will help advance PNE education in the U.S."

We know the presidents of different political parties generally have different domestic agendas, that Democratic legislators from the South often vote differently from their counterparts outside that region, and that mass political behavior is related to social and economic characteristics. We are less informed about the extent to which these factors influence the voting (judicial decision) tendencies of appellate judges. Indeed, development of integrated theories about why judges vote as they do has been impeded by the lack of a comprehensive and reliable data base. This type of information has been assembled for Supreme Court Justices, but this is the first project to extend the data collection to the far larger number of federal appellate judges. The project will assemble the requisite data on federal appellate judges and then make them available to the scholarly community in a user-friendly format. The constructed data base will include the following information for each judge: appointing president, predecessor (if there was one), religion, party affiliation, education, date and place of birth, state of residence, age at time of appointment, previous positions held (in temporal sequence), gender, race, ethnicity, A.B.A. rating (since these have been available), and the timing and reason for leaving the bench. A complementary data base on case characteristics and votes is being completed; both data sets will include a unique identification number for each judge, thereby permitting the merger of the two for appropriate research projects. The merged multi-user data base will allow the scholarly community to pursue important lines of research that heretofore were impossible. * **"

Young children failing to make and keep friends are often characterized as lacking social competence, older children/adolescents without friends are frequently characterized in terms of personality deficits and social deviance, and friendless elderly persons are often described as disconnected from the larger social world. Having friends and being a friend are considered generally positive qualities, but recent reviews and descriptive empirical studies have also pointed out that having the 'wrong' friends or participating in 'low quality friendships' can promote sub-optimal developmental trajectories. There is, however, relatively little research evidence documenting the formation and maintenance of friendships varying in terms of ""quality,"" and even less research has focused on potential influences of friendship quality over significant periods of time in stable and changing groups of young children. Very few studies of children's friendships adopt experimental designs to test hypotheses concerning the role of friendship (or friendship quality) as a determinant of developmental outcome. Finally, studies of friendships rarely attempt to coordinate this domain with other relational dimensions salient to children, such as social dominance. This project is proposed as an effort to provide both descriptive and quasi-experimental data concerning antecedents to, correlates of, and outcomes associated with participation in a range of friendships in a large sample of preschool-age children. In a longitudinal study, observations of peer-directed behavior, interviews, and adult ratings (teacher, parent) will be used to characterize individual differences in children's social competence and social dominance with peers. Relevant academic readiness/accomplishment data will also be gathered from parent/teacher ratings and classroom documentation. Antecedent variables will include child temperament/personality, demographic attributes (gender, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, general physical health and attendance records), and teacher/child relationship indicators. Friendship dyads will be determined on the basis of sociometric and/or proximity data (as appropriate for children of different ages). Outcome measures will include assessments from domains of peer social competence, social interactions with friends and acquaintances in natural and laboratory contexts, competition and aggression based social hierarchies, and stability of friendships over time. Descriptive analyses will document the range of friendship quality (along multiple cross-tabulated dimensions) characterizing children from the late toddler period (30-42 months) to kindergarten age (approximately 60-70 months), relations between friendship quality, social competence, and social dominance across this range of ages, and relative influences of adult/child (teacher) versus peer relationships on subsequent measures of social competence, social interactions, and stability of friendships. This study will provide broadly descriptive and prescriptive characterizations of friendships and friendship quality across the preschool period and will explicitly consider friendship and dominance relationships as interactive co-determinants of peer-directed social behavior in the peer groups of young children."

The global economy is in the midst of large-scale transformation driven by innovations in IT and the explosive growth of the Internet. IT is reshaping markets and consumer and enterprise behavior, while at the same time business realities determine which IT innovations are viable. Little is yet known about the economic and social impacts of this transformation. Significant new research is needed on various types of IT-enhanced economic environments, including: markets with asynchronous participation; markets with automated agents; new market formats enabled by IT; and new composite information services. Automated trading agents play an increasing role in the IT-enabled markets, and their interaction with human traders demands close scrutiny.<br/><br/>The methods to be employed in this project include the development of new theoretical models and the testing and refinement of the models in controlled experiments with human subjects. To date, the most detailed scientific knowledge of trader behavior and market performance is confined to classic market formats and to very simple goods. This research will expand that classical knowledge, test its robustness, and open new lines of inquiry by considering a broader range of market formats (one-sided auctions, two-sided markets and new hybrids), a broader range of goods (including new composite IT service products), and a broader range of behavior (including human interaction with automated agents).<br/><br/>The scientific knowledge generated by the research will disseminate swiftly into the community of e-commerce practitioners, and will help provide a sounder basis for integrating IT into the world economy. The platforms for running the various market formats and automated agents will be incorporated into the National Science Digital Library, enhancing infrastructure for teaching and research. Teaching, training and learning will be promoted directly for numerous graduate students who serve as research assistants and programmers; some undergraduates will also help with the programming and hundreds will serve as laboratory subjects who become experienced in market trading and controlling market agents. Given the ethnicity of students at the campuses, and given the history of employment at the labs, a large share of the educational benefits are likely to accrue to women and members of minority groups."

To understand STEM expectations of success and interests in pursuing STEM careers, it is imperative to understand the achievement-related choices people make when deciding what areas to study and what careers to pursue. If mentoring is to be used to its fullest capacity in increasing students' interest in pursuing STEM careers, it is imperative to delineate what type of mentoring is most effective in increasing STEM self-efficacy and achievement-related choices. This proposal is addressing the following research questions: ""Can a general 'best practices' mentoring approach be effective or is a specific self-efficacy approach needed? Is a combination of the two approaches optimal? In addition, does student ethnicity moderate the impact of the mentoring approaches?"" Forty-eight teams of approximately 480 male and female participants represent middle school classes that have not previously participated in robotics or a similar STEM activity. Team mentors are divided into those receiving best-practices mentor training, self-efficacy mentor training, a combination, and no mentor training (control group). All teams participate in a Botball regional robotics competition organized by the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics. Employing a mixed factorial design, the study examines three types of mentor training for their impact on STEM self-efficacy and expectations of success and/or STEM achievement-related choices. The results along with the feedback from mentors will be used to develop a mentor-training package that could be used in all robotics programs and be generalized to other similar STEM activities."

The project will study the complex processes that contribute to this delayed diagnosis among African-American women. Relying on a sociocultural model of the medical behaviors involved, the student will test hypotheses which explain the differential in delayed diagnosis by ethnicity in three areas: doctor-patient relationships, differential expressions of pain and suffering, and social network/support resources. The methods include structured and semi-structured interviews, psychosocial instrument assessments, individual case studies, and intensive observation of clinical encounters, support group meetings and social relationships. This research is important because it will advance our understanding of racial differences in doctor-patient relationships, and will contribute to understanding the obstacles facing chronic disease sufferers. This new knowledge will be useful to biomedical practioners interested in improving their relationships with their patients, and to public health professionals interested in designing education programs for women with SLE and their families, or larger media campaigns concerning societal attitudes towards chronic illness."

The specific aims of this conference are the<br/>following:<br/>1) To provide a forum for discussion of recent unpublished data by scientists with<br/>common interest in the study of the chemistry and biology of tetrapyrrole compounds.<br/><br/>2) To promote the exchange of ideas between established and new investigators from a<br/>wide variety of scientific disciplines (e.g., chemists, biochemists, clinicians, plant<br/>biologists, microbiologists, biotechnologists) by providing ample discussion time<br/>following formal presentations, by holding poster sessions which serve as a focus for<br/>the discussion of common interests.<br/><br/>This biennial interdisciplinary conference has stimulated collaborations between basic<br/>biologists, chemists and clinicians interested in tetrapyrroles for more than three<br/>decades. In association with proteins, tetrapyrroles serve diverse roles as biological<br/>redox catalysts, in the harvesting of light energy, in the activation and delivery of<br/>oxygen, and as signaling molecules. Free tetrapyrroles are also essential nutrients<br/>(e.g., vitamin B12), serve as regulators of gene expression (e.g., hemes), and are being<br/>utilized as therapeutic agents (e.g., photodynamic cancer therapy, target delivery of<br/>radionuclides). Owing to their photodynamic activity, toxicity and lipophilicity, the<br/>accumulation of tetrapyrroles (e.g., porphyrins, bilirubin) is associated with numerous<br/>pathologies of the skin, liver and brain. For these reasons, this conference represents<br/>an important venue for exchange between basic and applied researchers on<br/>tetrapyrroles and for refinement of new tools and therapies for development by the<br/>biomedical industry. Funds requested in this application are targeted to support 10<br/>young investigators who have not previously had the opportunity to attend this<br/>conference and for travel of two young ioprimarily undergraduate institutionle<br/>researchers. The sessions, which highlight recent technological progress, will include<br/>22 invited speakers, a plenary lecturer and 14 discussion leaders. All of these<br/>individuals have been selected for their scientific excellence, recent innovative work<br/>and contribution to the breadth of the program. The remaining 100 conferees will be<br/>chosen to ensure a broad representation of women, ethnicity and young scientists from<br/>various disciplines in academia, medical research institutions and industry. Strengths<br/>of this ongoing Gordon conference are its high disciplinary diversity, integration of<br/>research from basic chemistry through practical and clinical applications, focus on<br/>new unpublished work, time for discussion, informal atmosphere, and ban on<br/>dissemination of conference proceedings, (which it is essential to assure<br/>confidentiality when discussing unpublished results)."

This international GRC has occurred on a triennial basis since 1976, and alternates between sites in the US and Europe.<br/>Intellectual Merit: The specific focus of this GRC, intimacy, emphasis on extensive, orward thinking, off-the-record discussion, and its stature, are not duplicated by related conferences in this field. The 2002 conference received one of the highest evaluations of all GRCs and the elected, international organizing committee, comprised of Drs. George Bowes (University of Florida) and Susanne von Caemmerer (Australian National University) as Co-Chairs, and Drs.Michael Salvucci (USDA-ARS Arizona) and Anne Borland (University of Newcastle, UK) as Vice-Chairs, has developed a timely and intellectually stimulating program to emulate that meeting's success. Consistent with recent trends in this GRC and in the field's advancing science, it is designed to be integrative and to encourage conferees to think beyond their specific research interests. It will also introduce participants to the latest technologies that they might use, and will give access to colleagues with expertise in developing and using these technologies. The program consists of nine formal sessions and four contributed poster sessions (see the GRC website http://www.grc.org/programs/2005/co2.htm, and the February 4th, 2005 issue of Science). Thus, under the general theme of photosynthetic CO2-assimilation, the program starts with a session on photosynthesis and global climate change: the big picture (Session 1); it continues with CO2 entry into photosynthetic organisms and how it is modulated (Sessions 2, 3);advances in regulation of the primary CO2 fixation enzymes (Session 4); the utilization of fixed carbon, and gene regulation in C4 and CAM plants, including single-cell C4 systems and their evolutionary and agricultural significance (Sessions 5, 6); a session highlighting the work of early-career plant biologists and late-breaking findings (Session 7); new technologies applicable to photosynthesis research (Session 8); and a featured, after-banquet, wrap-up presentation on the genomics of signaling (Session 9). As befits a GRC, all speakers must present their very latest, unpublished findings, and be bold in proposing novel concepts and unanswered questions that help to define where the science is headed in the future. An entire session is devoted to early-career scientists and hot-off-the-press results selected from the best abstracts and recent literature. Thus the goal of this modest funding request is to provide support toward conference fee and/or travel costs for conference participants, especially early-career plant scientists, including postdocs, graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and beginning PIs. Speakers and discussion leaders were selected based on their research quality and impact, and to provide a diversity of ideas, nationality, gender, ethnicity, career-stage, and work-place.<br/>Broader impacts: The participation of junior scientists will be of immense professional benefit and encouragement to them by providing the opportunity to network with established leaders in the field. It also enhances the dynamic, cutting-edge nature of this GRC and the success of Session 7 depends upon it. This GRC delves into exciting advances in a field of experimental plant biology that directly relates to environmental and agricultural issues faced by a world that is undergoing rapid atmospheric CO2 enrichment and associated changes in the climate."

From the standpoint of neighborhood effects research (that is, understanding how the social context in which people are embedded shapes their life outcomes) there is the persistent thorny question of selection: are observed differences in outcomes across neighborhoods due to differences in neighborhood context, or due to differences in what leads a person to be in a particular neighborhood in the first place? In the area of residential segregation, theories of its causes have focused on preferences, discrimination, and economics but have been largely silent on the residential search process and how it contributes to segregation. Evident in both areas of research is that relatively little is known about the process of neighborhood selection. However, what is known points to the importance of understanding people's experiences, knowledge, and perceptions of communities throughout their metropolitan area. There is a need to better understand how people live in cities: which neighborhoods they access on a regular basis, how they perceive various neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, where they search for housing when it is time to move, which areas they know little about and/or avoid, and which factors determine where they choose to live. <br/><br/>Existing data-collection tools are inadequate for efficiently collecting data on these potentially crucial aspects of residential selection because they have focused on perceptions of the neighborhoods in which people do live, and have tracked movements of individuals across space, but they lack information on perceptions of other potential residential locations--those not occupied by the respondents. They also do not answer questions about how those perceptions are shaped by daily experiences, residential histories, and social networks. The purpose of this project is to develop an innovative computer-aided survey tool to measure individuals' perceptions, experiences with, and knowledge of, a large number of communities and neighborhoods within their larger metropolitan area. The tool, which will utilize interactive, computer-based mapping features, will be designed for incorporation into a large-scale survey designed to assess the multifaceted factors that drive processes of neighborhood choice and maintain residential segregation by race and ethnicity. This new set of survey tools will permit, for the first time, the collection of detailed data about how individuals, access, experience, and perceive large numbers of neighborhoods within their region. This information, when combined with survey data on individual economic characteristics, family dynamics, social attitudes, and other factors that shape residential decision-making will provide the ability to test both traditional theories of the causes of racial residential segregation and previously unexplored factors related to knowledge of, experiences in, and perceptions of communities in the metropolitan area. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>The issues at the core of this research proposal--racial inequality in particular, and the influence of neighborhood conditions on individual outcomes in general--are of great social significance and concern. Residential segregation has been shown to have an array of negative consequences for individuals and communities across a host of outcomes, including health, education, employment, and exposure to crime. To understand how to address these problems, it is critical to understand the processes that generate them. The project develops a set of innovative tools to collect data on previously ignored facets of residential selection processes. The research findings will be of interest beyond sociology: social scientists across a range of disciplines are interested in the question of how context, especially neighborhood of residence, shapes life outcomes. From the standpoint of survey methodology, the project also promises innovative uses of survey technology in general (use of laptop/tablet combinations in CAPI), and mapping technology in particular (for survey measurement, as against the sample management and interviewer assignment tasks for which it has been used previously)."

It is intended as a contribution to linguistic geography, empirical dialectology, and computational geography. Conventional methods of quantitative spatial analysis have been found to be ill-suited to analyze the Linguistic Atlas of Middle and South Atlantic States (LAMSAS) databases accumulated over several decades of extensive field work. Thus, the project will employ a neural network model, called Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), which has never been used to analyze linguistic data, and the study will be a test of the robustness of SOM on geographic problems. The following specific linguistic and dialectologic questions will be addressed:<br/>1. How are linguistic features (whether words, grammatical constructions, pronunciations, or combinations of the latter) distributed over geographic areas, if not in relatively uniform patterns of complementary distribution?<br/>2. Are the configuration and density of the road network critical elements of the creation and shaping of dialectal regions?<br/>3. Since individual linguistic features can be shown to have specific distributions in geographic space, are there some relatively small group of linguistic features that can be perceived as most ""salient"" in the identification of regional differences? <br/>4.

What is the interaction of personal/social variables such as sex, age, ethnicity, occupation, and education, with geographic variables such as location and community type (urban/rural)?<br/><br/>The project is an empirical study of language variation across geographic areas and socio-demographic groups conducted on the largest digital database of language features in North America. Traditional dialectologists have assumed that there were such things as regional dialects and that they only needed to find diagnostic linguistic features to demonstrate the presence and boundaries of the dialect areas. The primary tool of traditional dialectologists was the isogloss, which was supposed to represent the geographical limit of occurrence of some linguistic feature; bundles of isoglosses that ran in about the same place were taken to be dialect boundaries. Recently, quantitative approaches have indicated that linguistic variations are considerably more complex. This project will rely on novel computational techniques of data compression to further our understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of language in the distribution of features across territory and social dimensions. By not starting with the assumption of the systematicity of language and dialect that generativists and traditional dialectologists and sociolinguists share (i.e. that all speakers of a language or dialect share essentially the same rules and inventories of linguistic features), this research has the potential to build a multidimensional cultural model in which language is not removed from society as an independent system but instead is well-integrated with other regional and social characteristics."

This interest has been spurred by a visible and growing environmental justice movement, by public concerns about the health and other quality of life consequences of pollution, and by increasing government attention to these issues. This study analyzes the geographic distribution of airborne industrial toxic pollution in the United States over time to address several questions: (i) Have rates of reduction in air pollution risk over time differed between low-income and predominantly minority communities and other communities? (ii) How does the interaction between income and race/ethnicity as correlates of exposure to point-source air toxics vary across regions and across industrial sectors? (iii) How does individual mobility affect racial and socioeconomic disparities in cumulative exposure: who moves, who stays, and do those who move relocate to more or less polluted localities? <br/><br/>The study uses a unique dataset from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Risk Screening Environmental Indicators Geographic Microdata (RSEI-GM). The data offer a fine-grained picture of exposure to industrial toxic air releases identified by chemical and source facility for the entire U.S. for the years 1988-2007. The study will merge the RSEI-GM data with tract-level socioeconomic and demographic data from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses and the 2004-2009 pooled American Community Survey as well as individual-level data from the 1986-2001 Americans Changing Lives Survey. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This project will establish an infrastructure for the development, maintenance, and sharing of the complex RSEI-GM pollution-exposure database, spatially merging it with social, economic, demographic, and health data, and training graduate students in the management and use of the data.

Analysis of public good provision is increasingly based on models that characterize self-selection of citizens into municipalities and collective choice via majority rule within municipalities. This project combines a theoretical framework of interjurisdictional sorting with a newly-developed empirical strategy that takes sorting effects into account. <br/><br/>The theoretical model yields strong predictions about the distribution of households by income within and across jurisdictions. These distributions can be; matched with empirical income distributions observed in a sample of communities. The key methodological insight is that matching income distributions allows us to characterize boundary indifference loci of adjacent communities, as well as loci of pivotal voters within each community in locational equilibrium. The estimator proposed here controls for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity among households, observed and unobserved characteristics of communities, the potential endogeneity of prices and expenditures and the self-selection of households into communities of their choice. The structural parameters of the model are estimated using data of the Boston Metropolitan Area and the project extends the analysis to other settings. <br/><br/>The extent to which mobility constrains the choices of a jurisdiction depends not only on actual mobility, but also on how political actors or citizens perceive the impact of mobility on their communities. The project formulates and tests various hypotheses about voter behavior, with special focus on the extent to which voters in a community take mobility by others into account when making political decisions. The project also investigates the importance of clustering in communities by income or other characteristics, such as race or ethnicity."

Scholars have previously explored how state, activists, and medical actors influence the construction of health-related public problems, but there are currently no scholarly models that integrate news professionals? decisions about which issues to cover and how. This project investigates the ways journalists and key stakeholders selectively problematize and respond to health-related issues, by comparing the controversies over female genital cutting (FGC) and male circumcision (MC) as practiced in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, from 1985-2007. Whether they should be viewed as issues of health, human rights, gender oppression, or religious/cultural identity is hotly debated. Specifically, this study asks: How does the status of different stakeholders, and alliances among them, affect debate processes and policy outcomes? What factors influenced stakeholders? framing of the issues and those frames? effectiveness? How do news media practices shape the coverage of issues, stakeholders, and frames? In what ways did the broader social/historical context affect these processes? Three types of data will be gathered and analyzed using grounded theory techniques: materials produced by activist, medical, religious, and other stakeholder groups (e.g., press releases, brochures); accounts from national and regional newspapers and news magazines; and interviews with journalists, editors, activists, medical association leaders and media liaisons, and other key actors. The intellectual merits of this project include contributions to the research literature on social problems, health and medicine, journalism, and social movements. The research will shed light on the theoretically important but rarely studied matter of ?failed? domain expansion, whereby activists concerned with one issue attempt to capitalize on the success of a similar, successful issue. The study also will help to delineate the causes and consequences of defining problems in medical terms (i.e., medicalization). <br/><br/>The project will have a broader impact by expanding knowledge of the ways journalists, activists, state, and medical actors contribute to the construction of health-related public problems and policies. It will also produce more effective communication among, and public-policy engagement by, journalists and stakeholders; inform ongoing debates around MC and FGC in the three nations while illuminating local politics of gender, race/ethnicity, immigration, and religion; and provide tools for addressing concern about the ?over-medicalization? of society.

It both builds and marks an advance on decades of important study devoted to the question of why some social problems draw a great deal of attention from government officials, the public, and the media while other problems receive little notice (Baumgartner and Jones 1993; Best 1990; Blumer 1971; Cobb and Ross 1997; Gusfield 1981; Hilgartner and Bosk 1988; Kingdon 1995; Schattschneider 1975; Schneider and Ingram 1993; Spector and Kitsuse 1973; Walker 1977). One body of work emphasizes the characteristics of problems themselves as important determinants of attention. <br/><br/>This research has helped to underscore how the groups in society who are burdened by problems and the organized advocates who take an interest in problems affect the attention those problems receive; problems are constructed through a ihsocial process.le Other work on agenda-setting, however, focuses on aspects of the attention allocation process that help determine which problems receive attention. This research has demonstrated how temporal dynamics as well as the interplay between various sub-agendas (e.g., Congress, the media) affect which problems make their way into the public arena. Despite the evidence that aspects of both process and problem are integral to the phenomenon of attention allocation, researchers have tended to focus solely on one of these dimensions. Thus, empirical generalizations tend to emerge from incomplete or misspecified models. <br/><br/>The proposed project proceeds theoretically from the idea that the phenomenon of allocating attention to problems is a complex function both of problem characteristics (such as problem burden, the size and nature of organized communities associated with a problem, and a problem's cultural valence), and of process-oriented dynamics (such as the relationships that exist among the agendas of different institutions; the temporal dynamics of agenda setting, and the relationships between different problems jockeying for agenda space). Empirically, the project proposes to compare the attention given to multiple problems over time in different arenas in order to discriminate between the process-oriented and problem-oriented determinants of the attention allocation process. <br/><br/>This is accomplished by studying attention to 37 different diseases by the media, by government, and by the scientific community across 25 years. Disease offers a powerful lens to view the problem-specific and process-related dynamics of the attention generating process because diseases are both medical facts and social constructions, and because diseases have clearly defined outcomes, like hospitalization or death, so that their severity can be gauged with a common metric.<br/><br/>This study of the problem- and process-oriented determinants of agenda setting offers both scholarly and practical rewards. The research design promises to advance the theoretical and empirical understanding of both social problem construction and agenda setting. Moreover, because of the specific focus on disease, the findings will address major policy issues: how the government responds to public health priorities, as reflected in the media and via organized interest groups; how disparities in disease burden by race/ethnicity, sex and age shape priorities; how these priorities inform the complex decisions made by pharmaceutical companies, both in their research and development of new drugs and in their marketing of existing ones; and how government budgetary decisions might reflect (if not magnify) these priorities. More broadly, the proposed project speaks to how societal resources are selectively allocated across a field of seemingly equally attention-worthy social problems."

Analyses of development often consider program impacts and outcomes at a collective, community-wide level rather than at the level of the individual. Using the frameworks of social and cultural capital, this dissertation research project by a cultural anthropologist examines how personal assets differentially position Q'eqchi' individuals to take advantage of opportunities brought by development projects. <br/>Social capital refers to the resources that an individual or group has the ability to access through social networks, whereas cultural capital is more diffuse, including education, ethnicity, and dispositions gained through socialization. Research with Q'eqchi' participants and non-participants of development projects in two villages will investigate how assets of cultural capital such as bilingualism (Spanish and Q'eqchi'), educational level, experience living outside of the village, and knowledge of natural resources correlate directly with access to opportunities brought by development agents, as well as how these personal assets position individuals to form relationships with development workers which can lead to access to benefits. Benefits include employment in tourism, training in cash crop production, educational workshops, and travel opportunities. This comparative analysis will expand our understanding of social and cultural capital, which will contribute to a theory widely employed by economists, anthropologists, and sociologists. As ethnographic research among the Q'eqchi' is limited, this research will also expand the field of Maya studies. Broader impacts include new knowledge to help development planners ensure the success of their projects, as well as the advance in the education of a young social scientist."

Since the program?s inception, these institutions have supported the career and professional development of 116 Ph.D. graduates and have provided direct support to over 500 students and 80 graduate programs. The broader goal of the AGEP Alliance is to catalyze institutional change to increase the number of underrepresented minority faculty at American universities and colleges. Working towards this goal, each Alliance partner has developed an individualized program for its campus population. The diversified activities at each institution cover financial, academic, social, and professional development aspects of the graduate student experience; areas that are critical for the successful degree completion of underrepresented minority doctoral students and their future advancement into the professoriate. The goal of this evaluation project is to analyze the conditions required for the institutionalization of the most effective policies and practices that emerged through the project. In pursuit of this goal the PI will conduct an in-depth analysis of the project's measurable outcomes through a summative evaluation that will provide evidence of project impact in key areas of recruitment, retention and career advancement. The findings will reveal best practices for institutionalization and opportunities for future exploration and programming. <br/>Intellectual Merit: Most of the studies of academic support focus on the K-12 and undergraduate levels, thus there is a critical need for more data and analysis from the perspective of graduate school and career advancement. The findings of the evaluation component of this project will contribute to the knowledge base on effective strategies for STEM graduate persistence and graduation. <br/>Broader Impacts: The NSF AGEP project is a pioneer program that has introduced effective models for engaging and supporting underrepresented minority graduate students towards success.

Does jury diversity per se improve the quality of jury deliberations or is it merely the inclusion of jurors from underrepresented groups that improves deliberation quality? The proposed dissertation research consists of three studies manipulating jury diversity and evidence strength to examine whether diverse juries make better decisions than homogenous juries. In each study, mock jurors will watch a trial simulation video (which varies the strength of the evidence presented at trial), deliberate, and render verdicts, allowing the PIs to examine whether more diverse juries are better able to evaluate evidence strength. The three studies vary the method of manipulating jury diversity. In Study 1, the deliberations of mock juries comprised of all Hispanic jurors will be compared with the deliberations of juries with a majority of Hispanic members and two White members to examine whether the findings of previous research are dependent upon a privileged majority (Whites) creating the homogenous jury. In Study 2, the deliberations of all-White juries, all-Black juries, and mixed juries will be coded to evaluate the extent to which jury diversity influences whether juries engage in more complex reasoning. The third study will use a minimal groups paradigm to explore whether the impact of diversity on deliberation quality extends to diversity created through a characteristic other than race or ethnicity, specifically the distribution of wealth among jury members. The intellectual merit of this proposal stems from its investigation of the mechanism by which jury diversity improves jury deliberations. U.S. courts have repeatedly recognized the importance of the presence of minority jurors on juries. The proposed research will provide evidence regarding what types of diversity are necessary to achieve the courts? goal of improving justice."

The project is a three-year study of the critical factors related to mathematics and science laearning in secondary schools. There is a persistent national concern about the mathematics and science achievement of the U.S. secondary students. The major purpose of the proposed study is to identify, analyze and examine the interrelated factors that have been shown by research and theory to be related to mathematics and science learning by developing a more comprehensive conceputal framework. Despite growing body of knowledge in the area of academic achievement, research findings in mathematics and science learning have been inconsistent and have produced limited understanding of the processes of achievement in these critical subject areas. Research has linked mathematics and science achievement o several important domains: socio-demographic variables such as gender, ethnicity, race and social class; cognitive and affective variables such as prior achievement, ability interest, motivation, attitudes and beliefs; teacher, classroom and school variables such as opportunity to learn (OTL), instruction and social context of the classroom. Using these constructs, theoretically sound and a priori models will be developed and estimated to understand the effects of these variables on mathematics and science achievement and their interrelationships with each other. Multivariate analytical procedures such as Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) will be used to analyze the data. The two nationally representative data sets that would be used in the study are the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY). These two data sets, being cross-sectional and longitudinal respectively, offer different analytical advantages. <br/><br/>This project was proposed as a three-year secondary analysis of existing survey data for the secondary school students collected for the Third International Mathematics and Science study. It would focus only on US students, but would luse the information collected in that study on their attitudes toward science and their gender, race, and social class. The proposal also would use a longitudinal study, Longitudinal Survey of American Youth, to expand this analysis."

By freeing and expanding currently overbooked research compute resources, the proposed compute cluster will have a significant impact on training and educating graduate and undergraduate students, including a high percentage from populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Based on URM enrollment, UCR has been designated by the Dept. of Education as an Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). The availability of adequate computing and its beneficial impact on research programs will serve to attract outstanding students to a large number of undergraduate and graduate programs, including successful NSF-Funded REU and IGERT programs. New courses planned in conjunction with system acquisition will train students in parallel computing concepts and offer expanded access to integrate Big Data computing into their research projects. The Big Data compute cluster of this project also will support several smaller biotechnology companies in California that already use IIGB's computer facility. Future users from external research institutions, minority-serving colleges and industrial partners, particularly start-ups, will be actively recruited to gain access to IIGB's computing resources. Combined with UCR's diverse ethnicity and research mission, this investment will benefit a wide array of research directions and technology-based economic development initiatives at UCR, an institution that serves as an important driver of economic development in California's Inland Empire.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enable Big Data driven research at UCR to address grand challenge questions in a highly interdisciplinary environment. Questions include: How do different organism groups adapt to, and defend themselves against extreme environmental conditions or pathogens? How can more efficient and selective small molecules be developed to accelerate discovery-oriented chemical biology and genomics research? How can this knowledge translate into improved stress and pathogen tolerance, for example in crops to respond to global climate change and feed a growing world population? Recent advances in high-throughput and monitoring technologies offer, for the first time, novel methods to address these challenges systematically, comprehensively, and with unprecedented resolution. The new Big Data compute cluster substantially strengthens UCR's high-performance compute infrastructure and provides a critical enabling resource for UCR researchers from a broad spectrum of research specializations, including environmental science, chemical genomics, evolution, statistics, computational biology, and genome biology of multiple organism groups. Since this research relies on high-throughput and computational modeling approaches, its success and future growth is critically dependent on high-performance computer resources to manage and process large and rapidly increasing data sets. The system will be managed by experienced personnel in the Research Compute Facility of the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology (IIGB). The IIGB facility serves a broad user population distributed across departments from more than 50 research groups with 160 active users. The requested computing system therefore will reach a maximum number of NSF-funded investigators at UCR and constitutes a cost-effective investment of NSF and UCR funds."

The result will include (1) ?developing a proof-of -concept VR simulation that challenges students to solve a problem and integrates the publication, comparison and analysis of their data; (2) ?evaluating the simulation's effectiveness in supporting all students' understanding of standards-based science content and process and attitude toward it, including those with special needs; and (3) ?identifying requirements for an authoring tool to create a group of VR simulations. Successful proof-of-concept will lead to cost-effective, high quality, and more accessible authentic learning experiences for all students.<br/><br/>This project provides an opportunity through the development and testing of new universal access and design features to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in authentic learning experiences. These features include the ability for students to select an avatar according to race, gender, or ethnicity; low bandwidth modem requirements for use in areas without a technology infrastructure; and sign language interpretation for deaf/hard-of-hearing students. A Virtual Tutor provides constant attention to students' actions and ideas, using verbal and visual modes of communication appropriate for that student--a benefit rarely realized in most classroom settings and one that advances discovery and scientific understanding and promotes learning that can continue over a lifetime. Additionally, learning with a VR simulation dramatically increases access to age-appropriate standards-based learning for students in classrooms without laboratories, in hospitals, and for those with mobility disorders or special learning needs including dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. By publishing the Virtual Marble Roll and commercializing an authoring tool for creation of new, universally designed VR simulations, and by licensing the virtual tutoring technology, the partners will promote widespread use of the proposed research and development that will support future enhancement and application."

The project includes mapping and systematic excavation in a deserted village which dates to the Islamic period and was probably abandoned soon after. Mapping of surface features and limited soundings will also be carried out in two additional villages. This preliminary small scale work will provide the basis for a larger project. The fundamental question Dr. Boone wishes to address is how rural communities respond socially and economically to cycles of economic and demographic growth and decline associated with succeeding regimes of conquest and administration. In Portugal these include the Romans, Visigoths, Muslims and Christians and cover the period from approximately 100 to 1500 A.D. An ancillary issue to be addressed is the problem of ethnicity and the social organization of medieval populations inhabiting the dry, upland areas of the Iberian Peninsula where irrigation was impossible. These populations are known to have been distinct from groups in better watered regions. This research is important because it will provide insight into how relationships develop and are changed over time between urban and rural areas. The conditions which held in medieval Portugal still apply today to many areas in the Third World and the complex relationships which exist between rural inhabitants and the ruling urban elite (who are often culturally distinct) complicate regional politics and development efforts. Thus the work may have practical relevance. Archaeology has a unique contribution to make in such studies because it can examine such relations over long spans of time."

The UC Hastings project is a strategic partnership with a national organization that has a complementary focus on enhancing the representation of women in the academic STEM disciplines. With the broad network of AWIS and the expertise of the PIs, this partnership will utilize a train-the-trainer model to provides workshops-in-a-box, develop a rigorous economic analysis of retaining women in the academy, determine mechanisms for disaggregating gender bias by race and/or ethnicity and provide meaningful tools for change dissemination. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. The proposed project is expected to reach beyond higher education to include other AWIS chapters and non-profit STEM organizations. As such, there are significant broader impacts associated with the workshops. Additionally, by utilizing the national platform of AWIS, traditional means of dissemination are broadened to the greatest extent possible. Thus, the outcomes of the project that are related to women in STEM will easily reach a broad audience and contribute to engaging both institutions of higher education and STEM organizations in best practices related to promoting gender equity."

The research question is how characteristics come to carry connotations of esteem, social worth, and performance skills instead of being simply descriptive terms. Theoretically, under specified conditions, status value can spread from existing status characteristics to new nominal characteristics, changing them from simple descriptors to indications of social worth and ability. The research strategy is to design and conduct laboratory experiments to test the theory by attempting to create a new status characteristic in Year 1 at UNC Charlotte, and using complementary techniques to break down an existing status characteristic in Year 2 at Iowa. The research will improve the theoretical model and contribute to a large body of empirical research on status processes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work will appear in schools and organizational settings as applied researchers develop ways to control the status creation process using techniques similar to those we develop in the laboratory. For several decades, status generalization theories have been used to design interventions to reduce harmful effects of existing status characteristics such as ethnicity and gender; from this work we will understand ways to head off the creation of new characteristics, and to eliminate their status value. Such approaches should be very useful, eliminating status effects rather than partially overcoming them, or creating new status characteristics instead of temporarily conferring some status advantages and disadvantages. Even without interventions, understanding the process of status creation can allow observers to guard against it in their assessments of other individuals. Finally, this collaborative project links experienced PIs with a younger PI, strengthening the research infrastructure at both of the institutions."

(5) To develop each student's ability to record, analyze, and present scientific information. Overall, the goal is to promote the students' interests in scientific careers and to enhance their likelihood for success. <br/>Means of achieving the goals: The student participants will be integrated into faculty research programs and will be expected to perform like beginning graduate students. Informal faculty-student discussions plus weekly seminars will supplement the laboratory research. Weekly informal lunches, two picnics and a banquet will facilitate social and scientific interactions. At the end of each summer's program, the students will prepare oral presentations to be given at a Summer Program Symposium. Each student will also prepare a written research report, under the guidance of the student's mentor. <br/>Overall significance: Summer research programs are very valuable settings for bright students to experience basic scientific research. A significant fraction of the summer students do not have research opportunities at their institutions and might choose non-science careers due to lack of exposure to basic research. Of course not all students who participate in summer research programs in basic science choose careers in basic science, but experience shows that nearly all of the students to go on to post-graduate training in a graduate or professional school. The graduates of summer programs who do choose to go on to graduate school in science have a much better idea of what to expect, and they have a much greater chance of success."

Overall, there is surprisingly little research on the intersection of GIScience, community engagement, and health. This research focuses on colorectal cancer, a focus of cancer prevention and control efforts because early diagnosis greatly improves prognosis. However, screening rates remain low and differences in screening rates are associated with race, ethnicity and geography, among other factors. Using colorectal cancer incidences reported to the Iowa Health Registry, the research will create maps of colorectal cancer incidence, late-stage, mortality and screening as continuously varying surfaces using the method of adaptive spatial filtering, whereby a grid is laid over the study area and rates are computed for each grid point using overlapping circular filters that expand until they have pulled in enough information to calculate a stable rate. Statistical analyses will confirm the locations of higher than expected rates. These maps will provide context for community discussions of colorectal cancer. Community residents will be invited to generate information about the community's colorectal cancer experiences and barriers to screening and treatment. Participants and researchers will determine focal questions, such as ""why are late-stage colorectal cancer rates high in Storm Lake?"" and then generate responses to this question, sort the responses into categories, and rate them according to importance. <br/><br/>The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of health disparities. In addition, the researchers will engage communities in discussions of why local differences in cancer burdens are occurring and what they can do to lower the burden in their local areas. This research can contribute to a long-standing debate in geography about the relative merits, and the potential for integration, of quantitative and qualitative data, exploring the value of different types of space and place knowledge and the potential for integrating these types of knowledge to tell more of the story that contributes to health disparities. This research also will be important to the developing research area of translational research, which is just in its infancy in the discipline of geography, and will thereby contribute to increasing the relevance of health geography as a sub-discipline in the years to come. By improving the quality of geographic information through integration of empirical, quantitative spatial data and qualitative, community-generated knowledge, this research will move society toward not only a more nuanced understanding of the roots of disparity, but also toward more effective strategies to combat disparity. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

Acquisition of video cameras that can record images at thousands of frames/s will permit detailed studies of dust wave modes that are either self-excited in the plasma or excited at frequencies synchronized by external modulation of discharge parameters. A laser with increased power and stability coupled with an image intensifier and high speed video camera will result in an LIF system with a signal-to-noise ratio that is presently unavailable. This powerful diagnostic will permit multi-point correlation studies of new nonlinear wave structures as well as the detection of linear waves of very small amplitude.<br/><br/>The science enabled by this acquisition will have an interdisciplinary impact in other areas of plasma physics, including fusion energy and astrophysics, as well as biotechnology and soft condensed matter. The ability to make more sensitive and detailed measurements will be realized as an increase in the understanding of wave-particle interactions and a more detailed understanding of physics of dusty plasmas and soft condensed matter. The wave-particle interaction problem is a central issue in plasma physics which impacts space and astrophysical plasmas as well as fusion plasmas. Dusty plasmas are ubiquitous in space (Saturn's rings) and astrophysical (planetary nebula) plasmas as well as plasmas used in materials processing. The research enabled by this instrumentation will be conducted as part of the educational mission of the University. This includes MS and PhD thesis research of graduate students and research projects conducted by undergraduate physics students as part of the BS degree requirements.

This interest stems from a more critical perspective on what constitutes childhood and youth, with specific focus on how the production of space disenfranchises and marginalizes children and youth in contemporary urban society. Additional concerns to be addressed by the workshop include how children embrace identity politics and create space, how childhood is commodified and exploited, and how symbols between adults and youths are being homogenized. The workshop will bring together international scholars from a broad range of disciplines to discuss and probe this topic with the intent of identifying a focused research agenda for the near (ca. 5-10 yrs) future. This is an exciting, emerging, and potentially important area of research in Geography, and it shares similarities with other investigations focusing on the importance of spatiality to issues of race, class, ethnicity, gender, diversity, and physical disability. This workshop on Young People's Geographies will explore these commonalities and thereby may yield added insight into a broad range of theoretical and empirical concerns within the discipline.

In order to truly uncover the mechanisms involved in regional income dynamics, researchers must move past notions of correlation to address the more intricate issues of directionality and simultaneity. The spatial mechanisms involved in income convergence and inequality have only recently begun to take focus in the literature. A portion of this trend can be attributed to advances in spatial statistics and econometrics, which have helped to diffuse the knowledge of several inferential pitfalls associated with spatial effects in empirical data. The focus on space in economic growth and inequality is further apparent on an applied front, as evidence points to interesting socioeconomic constructs such as poverty traps and convergence clubs. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine these multifaceted phenomena using a number of different research approaches. The project will outline an exploratory geovisualization framework that is used to generate new insights into the functional relationship between regional growth and inequality in the presence of spatial dependence. A formal spatial econometric approach will be provided that addresses the role of intraregional spatial clustering and simultaneity in the evolution of regional incomes. This project also will examine regional economic change in a relative distribution framework in order to relax the assumptions often underlying the analysis if income data. Monte Carlo techniques will be used to evaluate the properties of the relative distribution subject to varying levels of spatial association. Several techniques will be employed to control for spatial effects thereby allowing for a decomposed and robust outlook on regional income dynamics.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to the increased awareness of the importance of space in the dynamics of economic systems. Several new spatially explicit tools will be employed that further develop the relevance of geography and regional science in the analysis of economic growth and change. The spatial extensions to the relative distribution methods can be applied to the study of any distributional comparisons of areal data. In the field of demographics, this research could shed light into to spatial variations in race/ethnicity composition at various geographical scales. The relationship between the reference and comparison distribution can be seen as analogous to the control and treatment groups in an experimental design. As such, researchers from many social science fields could utilize this framework to analyze the effectiveness of various policies across spatial boundaries. Lastly, the methods designed in this project will be integrated in the Open Source geocomputational toolkit STARS (Space-Time Analysis of Regional Systems), which continues to provide the broader research community with alternative dynamic spatial analytic tools. Finally, this Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award will enable a promising graduate student to pursue the first major project of an independent research career."

In particular, the rapid growth of social network sites (SNSs)?online spaces specifically dedicated to articulating users? networks?has spurred a bustle of academic activity. Using one popular SNS, Facebook.com, and collaborating with the administration at an undisclosed American university, the PIs have compiled two waves of network data on a complete college cohort of 1,640 students. The data also include information about the cultural preferences and group activities of our respondents over time. They will study phenomena such as the ethno-racial locus of homophily among students; the relationship between cultural ?tastes? and friendship; and the competing roles of spatial proximity and on-line affiliation in the formation of friendship groups. The PIs will collect data on the students for one additional year (when the majority will graduate from college); continue analyzing these data across multiple research agendas; present and publish this research; and, most importantly, make this dataset available to other researchers. Not only does this dataset contain some of the richest personal and relational data to be extracted from an SNS to date, but it also has a number of important advantages vis--vis past network datasets. 1) By collecting naturally occurring data, the Facebook instrument avoids a number of prominent measurement issues in social network research, including interviewer effects, memory limitations, and the artificial truncation of respondents? reported network ties; 2) Facebook enables complete network data to be collected on a large, naturally-bounded population. Hence, both ego-centric as well as ?socio-centric? analyses are possible; 3) The dataset is multiplex, containing data on Facebook friends, ?picture friends? (coded using postings in online photo albums), and?in a ?real life? supplement to these online measures?various kinds of housing data provided by the university; 4) Unlike the majority of network datasets, the final dataset will include four waves of longitudinal data; and 5) Facebook enables the collection of extensive, open-ended cultural data in the form of favorite movies, music, and books. As a result of these five features, the dataset can be employed for a number of intellectual projects that have heretofore been difficult or impossible to pursue. Such projects include examining the distinct role of race/ethnicity in network behavior; inductively determining the best way to measure and classify cultural preferences in light of the extant literature on cultural capital; and comparing the respective importance of cultural, demographic, and geographical factors in the formation of entire social networks.<br/><br/>Broader Impact. The final dataset will contain four waves of data corresponding to the four years respondents are in college. It will be available via the Internet to other researchers interested in utilizing this data. The project thus provides an important new resource for the broader community of network scholars, one that can be used for methodological development (refining tools for analyzing large, multiplex, directed, longitudinal, and/or two-mode data) and for examining diverse empirical phenomena (spanning fields from social stratification to cultural sociology).

It both builds and marks an advance on decades of important study devoted to the question of why some social problems draw a great deal of attention from government officials, the public, and the media while other problems receive little notice (Baumgartner and Jones 1993; Best 1990; Blumer 1971; Cobb and Ross 1997; Gusfield 1981; Hilgartner and Bosk 1988; Kingdon 1995; Schattschneider 1975; Schneider and Ingram 1993; Spector and Kitsuse 1973; Walker 1977). One body of work emphasizes the characteristics of problems themselves as important determinants of attention. <br/><br/>This research has helped to underscore how the groups in society who are burdened by problems and the organized advocates who take an interest in problems affect the attention those problems receive; problems are constructed through a ihsocial process.le Other work on agenda-setting, however, focuses on aspects of the attention allocation process that help determine which problems receive attention. This research has demonstrated how temporal dynamics as well as the interplay between various sub-agendas (e.g., Congress, the media) affect which problems make their way into the public arena. Despite the evidence that aspects of both process and problem are integral to the phenomenon of attention allocation, researchers have tended to focus solely on one of these dimensions. Thus, empirical generalizations tend to emerge from incomplete or misspecified models. <br/><br/>The proposed project proceeds theoretically from the idea that the phenomenon of allocating attention to problems is a complex function both of problem characteristics (such as problem burden, the size and nature of organized communities associated with a problem, and a problem's cultural valence), and of process-oriented dynamics (such as the relationships that exist among the agendas of different institutions; the temporal dynamics of agenda setting, and the relationships between different problems jockeying for agenda space). Empirically, the project proposes to compare the attention given to multiple problems over time in different arenas in order to discriminate between the process-oriented and problem-oriented determinants of the attention allocation process. <br/><br/>This is accomplished by studying attention to 37 different diseases by the media, by government, and by the scientific community across 25 years. Disease offers a powerful lens to view the problem-specific and process-related dynamics of the attention generating process because diseases are both medical facts and social constructions, and because diseases have clearly defined outcomes, like hospitalization or death, so that their severity can be gauged with a common metric.<br/><br/>This study of the problem- and process-oriented determinants of agenda setting offers both scholarly and practical rewards. The research design promises to advance the theoretical and empirical understanding of both social problem construction and agenda setting. Moreover, because of the specific focus on disease, the findings will address major policy issues: how the government responds to public health priorities, as reflected in the media and via organized interest groups; how disparities in disease burden by race/ethnicity, sex and age shape priorities; how these priorities inform the complex decisions made by pharmaceutical companies, both in their research and development of new drugs and in their marketing of existing ones; and how government budgetary decisions might reflect (if not magnify) these priorities. More broadly, the proposed project speaks to how societal resources are selectively allocated across a field of seemingly equally attention-worthy social problems."

With NSF support he will explore the nature of social interactions and 'prehistoric ethnicity' during the spread of the Neolithic complex - domesticated plants and animals - from a heartland in the Near East into the Southern Caucasus region. The project will investigate the potential mechanisms which include diffusion, migration or indigenous transformation responsible for this expansion. In collaboration with Georgian colleagues, he will conduct small scale excavations at four prehistoric sites in the Caucasus which span the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Eneolithic (ca 11,000 - 4,000 BC) The fieldwork is expected to provide stratified assemblages of material culture which encompass the period when agriculture and pastoralism first appeared. Radiocarbon dating will provide the basis for an absolute chronology. A combined study of archaeological assemblages from prior excavations, currently stored in the State Museum of Georgia, as well as those obtained in the course of the present study will be considered in a broader context of the archaeology of the spread of agriculture in the Near East and South-Eastern Europe.<br/><br/>The Neolithic marks a profound change in humans' relation both to the environment and to one another. With the domestication of plants and animals a trajectory was established which led from hunter gatherers living in small bands to early civilizations encompassing tens of thousands of individuals. While archaeologists have focused considerable attention on the multiple 'cradles' of domestication, much less is understood about how they spread across cultures and space. Multiple mechanisms including the diffusion of people vs. plants and animals per se vs. ideas have been proposed. This research will help to establish the basic cultural and chronological context in a region adjacent to such a cradle and permit multiple hypotheses to be examined.<br/><br/>The research will also further the academic and intellectual advancement of a promising graduate student and strengthen scientific relations between the US and the Republic of Georgia."

Up to twelve additional speakers will be selected from submitted abstracts for short oral presentations. The meeting also includes poster sessions and time for informal discussions. The conference incorporates programmatic and educational features to encourage meaningful participation by scientists and students representing diversity in experimental system, career level, ethnicity and gender.<br/><br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Since the sequencing of the first plant genome (Arabidopsis), it has become possible to envision the functionality of the entire complement of genes that encompasses a plant. This challenge has manifested a systems-based approach to visualize the expression of the entire genome. Specifically, technologies for globally measuring gene expression at the mRNA (transcriptomics) and protein (proteomics) levels have been developed. Metabolomics is the technology for globally measuring gene expression at the metabolite level, which probably represents the ultimate expression of the functionality of a genome that can be chemically defined. Metabolomics is an emerging field. The International Congress on Plant Metabolomics was initiated just 2 years ago and is the medium that brings together the leading practitioners in this new emerging area of plant functional genomics. Previous meetings have been held in Europe, and this, 3rd meeting in this series will be the first to be held in the US. The Congress will for the first time in this country provide a landmark opportunity for plant biologists, chemists and bioinformaticists to meet, discuss and interact in the context of a major international meeting on plant metabolomics. The Symposium will be one of an ongoing series of symposia sponsored by the Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University. The program will address the current and potential applications of metabolomics in gene discovery and directed genome modifications.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This symposium is designed to initiate and foster interactions among practitioners of metabolomics and researchers studying plant biology. The speakers have been chosen to present investigations on a variety of related topics, including the development of new analytical technologies, statistical analysis of metabolomics data, and the role of metabolomics in solving biological problems via a systems approach. Approximately one third of the invited speakers are women; up to twelve additional short talks will be selected from submitted abstracts to increase diversity in career level and to enhance participation of underrepresented groups. An important purpose of these symposia is to promote interactions and new collaborations among researchers who might not normally come together at a single symposium. In addition to the attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, special efforts will be made to encourage participation by NSF-REUs, other undergraduate students, and interested high school teachers. Long-standing relationships of ISU with historically black institutions and undergraduate research experience programs will foster attendance of underrepresented students."

As the consequences of climate change increasingly impact communities across the globe, the local institutions that mediate access to natural resources will be critical in shaping effective adaptation practices. This project will inform scholarship on social and ecological change by integrating political ecology and social-ecological systems theory to analyze the relationships between institutions, environmental change, and resource access. The doctoral student will focus on institutional responses to environmental changes in the globally significant ecosystem of the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Seasonal floods are an integral part of life for the residents of the Okavango Delta, where rural livelihoods depend on the floodwaters for important natural resources. In recent years, however, increased flooding levels have displaced residents from their homes and disrupted livelihood systems. The student will examine how social institutions that affect the rules of use that determine access to natural resources are responding to these increases in flooding. She also will evaluate the ways in which these institutional responses enable and constrain residents' livelihood systems. Her qualitative study will use household-level semi-structured interviews and a structured survey to address three specific and interlinked questions: (1) What are the institutions that govern access to wetland resources in the Okavango Delta? (2) How are these institutions responding to increasing levels of flooding? (3) How do these responses impact the ability of residents to access resources and sustain livelihoods?<br/><br/>This project will enhance understanding of how social institutions shape resource access in an aquatic ecosystem, a type of system previously under explored in the geographic subfield of political ecology. It will strengthen the social-ecological systems (SES) framework developed by Elinor Ostrom by applying the framework within a dynamic aquatic ecosystem. This project will add to current scholarship that is working to provide empirical detail to the SES framework and will add new variables, including: gender, ethnicity, informal rules, and seasonal access patterns. More broadly, the project will highlight the importance of understanding the relationships among environmental changes, social institutions, and resource access across Africa south of the Sahara and in the developing world. The project will contribute to environmental and climate change adaptation policy in the Okavango Delta by indicating how institutions are currently responding to environmental changes and will assess how well positioned they are to help residents respond to predicted future increases in flooding variability. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

Although it is often assumed that STEM majors start with calculus as their first college math course, this is not the case for many urban and minority community college students. This project is addressing the national problem of mathematics remediation for STEM majors by creating a game- and simulation-based algebra and trigonometry curriculum. The curriculum features three to five video games that place math content within real-world GIS scenarios. The curriculum is used in a summer immersion program for in-coming Geographic Information Science (GIS) majors at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC). The project will impact STEM education at a national level by providing all materials free and open-source to secondary and post-secondary institutions via a project website with downloadable curricula, game software, video tutorials, professional development materials for faculty and staff, and support forums. The summer immersion program pairs MAT 056, the most common remedial math course for BMCC STEM majors, with GEO 100, the first course in the GIS sequence. Students in the program are recruited from NYC high school graduates participating in BMCC's Science Technology Entry Program. After completing the summer program, students will receive special support services and internships in GIS to advance them into an articulating baccalaureate program at CUNY or in related industries. This project targets BMCC's large population of minority students (over 90%) and women students (nearly 60%). <br/><br/>Evidence-based research has shown gaming in the mathematics curriculum has the power to transform mathematics education from an intimidating and negative experience to one that is fun, engaging, and successful. While there are many promising NSF-funded science games that are engaging and promote deep learning, there are very few math games that do so, and even fewer that specifically cover algebra topics in a way that can be appreciated by adult learners. Success in basic algebra is a major stumbling block for students seeking technical careers. This project will build on: 1) a previous NSF grant award to develop a GIS major at BMCC and 2) a Department of Education Title V grant for Hispanic-serving institutions to enhance e-learning initiatives at BMCC, including game-based learning. Games and simulations will feature real-world applications that focus on skills and contexts necessary for a career in GIS. Results of this project will be disseminated through conference presentations and publications. Project outcomes will be assessed through in-game analytics, traditional quizzes and midterm exams, and the common department final exam for MAT 056. Department final exam scores and course retention rates will be compared with rates for the college as a whole, using a logistic regression analysis of statistically matched cohorts. In addition, differences by gender and ethnicity will be examined. Student opinion surveys and focus groups will further gauge the effectiveness of the games and simulations on student attitudes toward math and technical fields. Finally, the program will be examined using longitudinal data on student enrollment, two-year retention rates, and progress toward degree or transfer."

There has been ample qualitative research on the informal economy. However beginning in the early 1990's the investigators have developed, refined, and implemented a technique that allows for quantitative analysis of informal work via structured surveys administered to samples of adult individuals. The study will conduct the first nationally representative household survey of informal work in the United States.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of this study is to provide an empirical examination of the contours and correlates of informal work at the national-level. We have seven basic research questions. How prevalent is informal work in the United States? How does the prevalence of informal work vary spatially (for example, across the rural-urban continuum)? What is the relationship between household labor supply in the formal economy (both in terms of quantity and quality) and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between poverty, income, and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between social capital (for example, the strength of a household's social networks) and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between standard correlates of formal labor market stratification (for example, family size, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment) and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between industrial restructuring in the formal economy and participation in informal work?<br/><br/>Data will be collected through a telephone survey administered to a nationally representative sample of up to 1,700 adults. The survey instrument will be anchored around a set of survey items that ask about participation in several specific forms of informal work. In addition, the instrument will gather basic socio-demographic and economic information about sampled households, and geo-coding will allow us to merge and incorporate contextual information on place of residence. <br/><br/>The study will make important scientific contributions. It will be the first to provide reliable and generalizable evidence about the prevalence, importance and correlates of informal work, and to provide definitive evidence concerning several empirical and debated questions such as how informal work varies with formal labor supply, social capital of households, poverty status, and rural-urban residence. The broader impact of the study includes providing basic information on an important yet neglected economic survival strategy among households in the United States today. Research findings carry important implications for social policy as well. In recent years, entrepreneurship and small-business enterprise have been touted as viable economic strategies for households and their communities that may be struggling amidst industrial restructuring and attenuated support for social welfare programs. It is important therefore to understand informal work as a potential source of entrepreneurial vitality."

Identifying patterns of nucleotide variation that have resulted from natural selection may also help identify genetic variants that influence disease susceptibility and will further clarify the context of modern human evolution. <br/><br/>Malaria, resulting from infection by Plasmodium falciparum, causes millions of deaths each year, and is one of the strongest selective forces in recent human evolution. Because genetic variants at malaria resistance candidate genes may be targets of natural selection, nucleotide diversity at these loci can be examined to identify variants that affect susceptibility to malarial disease. African populations are particularly informative for studying patterns of genetic variation at malaria susceptibility candidate genes because they contain a high level of genetic diversity and are likely to have previously unknown genetic variants. In addition, due to high malarial endemicity in certain regions of Africa, it is likely that evidence of local adaptation to malaria will be detected within diverse African populations. <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to examine patterns of nucleotide variation, using DNA re-sequencing technology, at two malaria resistance candidate genes, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and CD36, in a diverse group of African and non-African human populations (39 total populations). This project will: 1) identify and characterize patterns of nucleotide diversity at two loci that have been suggested to influence susceptibility to malarial disease, 2) conduct statistical analyses to identify signatures of natural selection and examine the effects of demography, and 3) test for correlations between genetic diversity and climate, subsistence strategy, ethnicity, and the prevalence of P. falciparum infection. <br/><br/>These data will add to our limited knowledge of genetic diversity and the demographic history of African populations. These data will also add to our knowledge of how demography and natural selection have shaped patterns of variation within the human genome. Ultimately, this research will provide a clearer picture of human genetic adaptation and the co-evolution of human and P. falciparum genomes, and will contribute to the training of a doctoral student from an underrepresented group in anthropological genetics."

Conclusions will generate testable hypotheses (in animal models) about how some transitions in primate cranial evolution (e.g. size/shape changes, tooth number, shape, size, and eruption pattern changes, and brain size changes) have occurred through changes in patterns of facial development and integration. Data come from working with the National Down Syndrome Congress, Special Olympics of Pennsylvania, Centre County Down Syndrome Society, and Down Syndrome Buddy Walks. Members of the lab, at all educational levels (e.g., undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs,) are trained to collect 3D data and frequently volunteer at these events. These interactions have educated the research team about how Down syndrome organizations work and have educated members of the Down syndrome community about how the research might be beneficial in the long term. These experiences have strengthened the commitment to explain the research goals in a manner that is easily accessible to non-scientists.<br/><br/>Craniofacial characteristics are used to infer phylogenetic relationships between human ancestors and to estimate sex, ethnicity, and age in fossils, skeletal populations, and forensic anthropology. This project examines both normal and abnormal craniofacial variation to eventually understand contemporary human variation and the evolutionary variation found in our fossil record by understanding how chromosomal changes affect developmental processes of phenotypic production. Regarding the specific chromosomal change that causes Down Syndrome, the morphometric analyses of craniofacial morphology in this study will determine: 1) how levels of phenotypic variance are modified; 2) how developmental stability changes; 3) how patterns of variation are altered; and 4) how this particular chromosomal alteration compatible with life affects development to produce phenotypic variation."

SASs, such as Twitter and Facebook, are radically altering our society's information fabric. These new communication platforms are used by millions of people to share brief status messages in socially connected public forums. These messages expose vast amounts of data from, and about, local geographic communities -- data that reflect people's activities, interests, and attention, in thousands of localities worldwide. Using this vast and still emerging sources of data, this research program will make SAS into a viable and significant source of information with capacity to transform our understanding of local communities.<br/><br/>As a first activity, the research will adapt algorithms from other fields to identify temporal patterns in SAS data that are stable across multiple communities. Importantly, the work will reason about how and when these patterns break. For example, SAS data may expose sleeping patterns in a community, and help identify mass anxiety when these patterns break. Further, the project will develop methods to identify differences in SAS patterns between local communities, and connect these findings to other sources of data. Next, the research will develop methods to compare how different groups (e.g., by age or ethnicity) use specific neighborhoods and cities. Finally, the work will examine the relations between local communities and network ties as reflected in SAS data. The findings will form the basis for developing novel models of computation for SAS systems, and inform the creation of tools and applications geared to re-imagine SAS as reliable information systems for local communities.<br/><br/>The project is rooted in social computing and in human-centered approaches to development of new technology. As such, the work entails interdisciplinary investigation using methods and research questions drawing on fields as diverse as information and computer science, sociology, and communication. The project will tackle significant information challenges that these SAS and other social computing platforms present, such as the scale, bias, and the increasing amount of noise and spam, as well as the brevity and lack of context of posted messages. The research will develop novel methods and approaches to using these new information sources to extract knowledge about, and for, local communities.<br/><br/>The research focus on social media and local communities lends itself well to outreach and education activities. The outreach efforts will enhance the connection of public libraries to the communities they serve, and relate the social media experiences of people?s everyday lives to scientific challenges. Participatory design workshops and visits to select educational institutions will engage individuals currently underrepresented in the sciences. An interdisciplinary education program will prepare a diverse set of students at all levels to lead the next generation of innovation, research, and education in socio-technical systems.<br/><br/>Finally, this project will have a significant impact on our society. By leveraging SAS as novel sources of information, the research will lay the foundation for new studies about local communities. The resulting technologies and insights will inform and transform the work of local governments, news organizations, planners, and researchers, as well as local residents and activists, allowing them to take full advantage of these new repositories of human expression and thought with relevance to such diverse social challenges as emergency response, resource planning, and public health."

The likely mechanism for this high frequency is higher fertility and child survival for those people with the low-hemoglobin forms of those genes. <br/><br/>This research will test the hypothesis that Tibetan women at high altitude in Nepal with the low-hemoglobin variants of the genes have more surviving children than those with the other variants. 1350 women of Tibetan ethnicity residing at 3000m or higher who have completed their reproductive careers will provide DNA for typing the genes called EPAS1, EGLN1 and HIF1alpha that were previously found to regulate the response to hypoxia (low oxygen availability), such as that occurring at high altitudes. In addition, measurements of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, as well as information on these women's fertility history and the survival of their children, will be collected. <br/><br/>The predicted outcome is that women with the forms of the genes that are most frequent among Tibetans will have lower hemoglobin concentration, higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, and more surviving children. Those results will connect a severe environmental stress to biological and genetic variation and reproductive success, building a case for natural selection operating in a human population and improving our understanding of the processes of adapting to new environments. This U.S.-Nepalese collaborative research has health implications at all altitudes because these genes are necessary for intrauterine development, and they play central roles in the biology of diseases as diverse as osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, heart failure, and cancer."

This project by an anthropologist from American University uses a case study approach to investigate the local variation of individual economic strategies in a rural area of Mali. The focus will be on how people get the social and technical knowledge needed to work, in particular how they use social networks to access resources and markets. The relationship between group characteristics (gender, ethnicity, age, religion, education) and individual experiences will be examined. The patterns of allocation between consumption and investment will be analyzed. Data will be collected by the researcher and her Malian anthropological colleagues to update a sample of 60 households first studied in 1978. Repeat visits to rural households will collect data on economic activities over time, intra-household transfers of resources and production, livestock transfers, expenses and investment. The new knowledge to be created will advance our understanding of how local action can be pro-active as well as reactive in economic development, and the extent to which individual as well as group action can be effective in creating social change. In addition the knowledge will be valuable for policy makers designing strategies to improve living standards for people in this savanna West African region."

From the standpoint of neighborhood effects research (that is, understanding how the social context in which you are embedded shapes your life outcomes) there is the persistent thorny question of selection: are observed differences in outcomes across neighborhoods due to differences in neighborhood context, or due to differences in what leads a person to be in a particular neighborhood in the first place? In the area of residential segregation, theories of its causes have focused on preferences, discrimination, and economics but have been largely silent on the residential search process and how it contributes to segregation. Evident in both areas of research is that we know relatively little about the process of neighborhood selection. However, what we do know points to the importance of understanding people's experiences, knowledge, and perceptions of communities throughout their metropolitan area. We need to know how people live in cities: which neighborhoods they access on a regular basis, how they perceive various neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, where they search for housing when it is time to move, which areas they know little about and/or avoid, and which factors determine where they choose to live. Existing data-collection tools are inadequate for efficiently collecting data on these potentially crucial aspects of residential selection because they have focused on perceptions of the neighborhoods in which people do live, and have tracked movements of individuals across space, but they lack information on perceptions of other potential residential locations?those not occupied by the respondents. They also do not answer questions about how those perceptions are shaped by daily experiences, residential histories, and social networks. <br/>The purpose of this project is to develop an innovative computer-aided survey tool to measure individuals' perceptions, experiences with, and knowledge of, a large number of communities and neighborhoods within their larger metropolitan area. The tool, which will utilize interactive, computer-based mapping features, will be designed for incorporation into a large-scale survey designed to assess the multifaceted factors that drive processes of neighborhood choice and maintain residential segregation by race and ethnicity. This new set of survey tools will permit, for the first time, the collection of detailed data about how individuals, access, experience, and perceive large numbers of neighborhoods within their region. This information, when combined with survey data on individual economic characteristics, family dynamics, social attitudes, and other factors that shape residential decision-making will provide the ability to test both traditional theories of the causes of racial residential segregation and previously unexplored factors related to knowledge of, experiences in, and perceptions of communities in the metropolitan area. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>The social problems at the core of this research proposal?racial inequality in particular, and the influence of neighborhood conditions on individual outcomes in general?are of great social significance and concern. Residential segregation has been shown to have an array of negative consequences for individuals and communities across a host of outcomes, including health, education, employment, and exposure to crime. To understand how to address these problems, it is critical to understand the processes that generate them. Our proposal offers the development of a set of innovative tools to collect data on previously ignored facets of these residential selection processes. The topic and project will be of interest beyond sociology: social scientists across a range of disciplines are interested in the question of how context, especially neighborhood of residence, shapes life outcomes. From the standpoint of survey methodology, the project also promises innovative uses of survey technology in general (use of laptop/tablet combinations in CAPI), and mapping technology in particular (for survey measurement, as against the sample management and interviewer assignment tasks for which it has been used previously)."

The student will conduct interviews with a sample of about 100 African American women divided into religious and secular leaders and non-leaders drawn from an elite population of women involved with national, state and municipal offices or organizations. The interviews will focus on life history and engagement with discrimination, the formation of a self image, and involvement with social action. This research is important because it will document the use of cultural politics to counter negative images and racism and to promote social change. The focus on religious as well as secular contexts will provide valuable information on how members of a minority elite use the social and cultural resources available to them to develop positive self-images and influence social policy.

With the strong and continuing importance of religion to American society, it is particularly important to understand whether religious involvement is related to mortality risks as some recent research finds and, if so, to determine the magnitude and mechanisms that characterize this relationship. Major new work on the topic has been widely publicized and has made a major impact in both the social science and medical literatures. Nevertheless, this area of research remains highly controversial, theoretically and methodologically underdeveloped, and lacking in depth. Through completing secondary analyses of a number of existing datasets this research will tackle a number of other current limitations that characterize the religion-mortality literature. Specifically, it will address the issue of whether selectivity is responsible for the association between mortality and religion. There are a number of factors that may influence both religious involvement and mortality that can account for this statistical association. However, this is perhaps the key question that needs to be addressed by the scientific community in order to understand whether the religion-mortality relationship may be considered causal or spurious. Second, only very limited research has considered the differential effects of religious involvement on mortality within subgroups of the population. This inattention to the diverse demographic landscape of the contemporary US can lead to empirical findings that, while potentially true among the whole population, mask substantial heterogeneity within the population. Third, only scant attention has been given to the specific causes of death that are influenced by religious involvement. Fourth, only recently have several population-based data sources become available that allow inquiry into the association between religious involvement and mortality at the national level. Thus, compared to other social and demographic factors that are central in the sociological mortality literature (e.g., SES, race/ethnicity, gender, age, marital status) and critical to the understanding of health and longevity in the United States, knowledge regarding religious influences on health and mortality is clearly limited. <br/><br/>There is a major debate in the medical literature about whether medical schools should teach courses on religion and health and about whether physicians should or should not use the religion health-mortality literature as one of the guides toward informing their relationships with patients. However, the evidence to date is far too tentative to conclude that religious involvement promotes health, although it is clear that the recent seems to be leaning that way. But until the issues of selectivity are fully addressed, questions regarding the spuriousness of the overall relationship will remain. Beyond the overall relationship, the specific social and demographic groups that are influenced, and the specific mechanisms by which religion may influence health and mortality, are just now beginning to be tapped. Thus, this project has the potential to shed light on sociological issues that have captured substantial public attention, as well as the attention of both the social scientific and medical communities. Further, within sociology, there is substantial interest in this subject matter ranging from medical sociology to demography to the sociology of religion, with faculty members and students from each of these areas involved in the research and interested in the findings. Second, the project will further contribute to the long-standing and very productive partnership between the Universities of Texas and Colorado."

K-12 computer education fails to attract the necessary number of students to CS - especially at the middle school level, where students make critical career decisions by judging their own aptitudes towards math and science. This is a serious problem because, despite the growing need for IT workers, enrollment in undergraduate CS programs is dropping at alarming rates. Scalable Game Design provides an ideal balance between motivational and academic concerns of CS. This approach is based on the existing Fluency with Information Technology framework recommended by the National Academies of Sciences and will be aligned with the emerging National IT education standards (ISTE NETS). This project will explore Scalable Game Design by building a low-threshold, high-ceiling design tool, called AgentCubes, featuring Incremental 3D modeling, animation, programming, and visualization. The project will incorporate the tool into a 3D Gamelet Design curriculum to provide an attractive route to the effective design, development, and deployment of an exceptionally large spectrum of games - ranging from simple 2D Frogger-like games to 3D Sims-type games.<br/><br/>The proposed technology has a high potential to increase the number of K-12 students interested in Computer Science (CS), which in turn should result in larger enrollments at the university level. Without stronger CS enrollments the US cannot maintain an internationally competitive IT workforce. A less programming-focused, more design-based IT curriculum is likely to increase the participation of women and minorities. Initial results from our feasibility study indicate that Incremental 3D approaches work across ethnicity and gender. The proposed 3-stage classroom integration strategy is based on a pipeline of required, elective, and transitional modules that introduce students to making simple games, move to more advanced games and computational science applications, and transition to traditional programming models. This strategy maximizes the exposure of public schools students in general, and women and minorities in particular, to computer science because all students will at least take the required one-week module. Furthermore, as a general end-user tool to create interactive 3D applications, the proposed technology will be useful beyond educational game design. Potential applications include computational science simulations, computational thinking tools and serious games with potential users such as university students, scientists, and engineers."

DksA, an atypical bacterial gene regulator, plays an essential role in the regulation of transcription (RNA synthesis) of ribosomal RNA (necessary for the synthesis of proteins in the cell) and of other genes involved in important cellular processes. DksA differs from most bacterial gene regulators in that it binds directly to RNA polymerase (the enzyme responsible for carrying out transcription) rather than to DNA. Little is known about the regulation of DksA itself. Therefore, this project focuses on attaining a detailed understanding of how Escherichia coli cells control the production of DksA in response to different growth conditions. Preliminary work indicated that the dksA gene is regulated at the level of transcription. The regulation involves two transcription initiation sites, and several other transcription factors. The dksA gene expression was also found to be controlled at the level of translation (protein synthesis), and this control required a specific portion of the dksA mRNA referred to as the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR). One aim of this project is to investigate how dksA is transcriptionally controlled under various different growth conditions. The dksA promoters, which control the initiation of transcription, including a newly discovered promoter, which is most active under conditions of starvation, will be more precisely defined. The dksA regulatory effects by several suspected transcription factors will be investigated in detail. The relative transcription activity from all dksA promoters will be simultaneously measured while in their native chromosomal contexts during different growth conditions and in different bacterial strains lacking any of suspected transcriptional regulators. Another aim is to investigate how dksA gene expression is controlled after the dksA transcript (mRNA) has been made. The project will examine the hypothesis that changes in the rate of breakdown of dksA mRNA during different phases of cell growth contribute to the regulation of dksA expression. The relative DksA protein levels in various E. coli strains and several other bacterial species will be measured during different growth conditions. The effects of suspected dksA transcription regulators on the cellular levels of DksA protein will also be examined. The RNA structure in the 5'-UTR of the dksA mRNA will be studied. The project also aims to detect, capture, and identify potential cellular factors that may associate with the 5'-UTR to affect translation control of DksA. Together, these experiments will provide a broad and extensive understanding of the cellular processes used to regulate this important global gene regulator in response to different bacterial growth conditions.<br/><br/>Broader Significance: Knowledge gained from this work will be applicable to other bacteria that are of environmental, industrial, or agricultural importance. Broader contributions will include research training of four graduate and eight to twelve undergraduate students, as part of their education experience at SUNY, Albany. Research training provided by the PI has thus far resulted in five doctoral graduates, three masters graduates, and twenty three research-trained undergraduate students of diverse race, ethnicity, and gender, that have subsequently succeeded in securing research, academic, or professional careers, or have continued on to acquire graduate or professional education. Synergy between research and teaching will also occur in the role of the PI as instructor of an undergraduate biochemistry laboratory course. The PI will train students in the application of molecular and biochemical approaches, some of which will be used to address aspects of this project. As a member of an underrepresented group, the PI is in a distinctive position to serve as a role model and mentor for underrepresented students wishing to pursue a career in the sciences. In his roles as coordinator of the undergraduate research program, coordinator of the biochemistry and molecular biology major, and instructor for a biochemistry lab course, the PI interacts with a number of minority undergraduate students with strong academic skills and motivation for research, among which several students will be enlisted to participate in this project and receive research training. The PI will interact with university campuses in Puerto Rico to recruit students to our graduate program and to this research project. Thus, underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students will be trained to conduct research in this project. Research training supports our nation's research infrastructure and increases appreciation and awareness of the importance of basic science research."

The primary objective of the proposed research is to apply techniques of geometric optimal control theory to the control of the spin dynamics by magnetic fields in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Through interaction with a magnetic field, NMR involves the manipulation of nuclear spins. It has many potential applications extending from the determination of molecular structures (NMR spectroscopy) and quantum computing, where NMR remains one of the most promising road in the construction of a scalable quantum computer, to medical imagery (MRI). The control technology developed over the past 50 years allows the use of sophisticated control fields and permits the implementation of complex quantum algorithms such as the Deutsh-Jozsa and the Grover algorithms. NMR is therefore an ideal experimental testbed for quantum control. The proposed research will also impact the domain of quantum mechanics. First, solving the contrast imaging problem can potentially have a profound impact on how medical imaging is done in hospitals. Indeed, by designing magnetic fields to maximize the distance between the two spin we increase the image resolution and therefore improve its quality which improves patient care. Second, by using geometric techniques our approach will complement existing efficient numerical tools for pulse sequence optimization, such as the GRAPE (gradient ascent pulse engineering) by providing an understanding of the qualitative structures of the dynamics of the system. In particular, the physicists will gain insight about the control mechanism that lead to the optimal solutions.<br/><br/>Starting as a tool for characterization of organic molecules, the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has spread to areas as diverse as pharmaceutics, medical diagnostics (medical resonance imaging) and structural biology. The principles of NMR have served as a paradigm for other physical methods that rely on interaction between radiation and matter. It is therefore not surprising that experiments in NMR also serve as good model problems in control of quantum systems. Recent advancements on the study of spin dynamics strongly suggest the efficiency of geometric control theory to analyze the optimal synthesis. Until now, the analysis of nonlinear optimal control has been mostly concerned with the class of single-input systems. Via this application in quantum control, it is proposed to extend the analysis to the multidimensional case. The proposal research will also impact significantly the field of quantum mechanics. First, medical imagery can be drastically improved through the contrast problem which will directly impact patient care in hospitals. Second, by using geometric tools to develop optimal synthesis, we provide physicists with an additional understanding about the control mechanism of the optimal solutions which in turn will help developing improved numerical schemes. We also propose an initiative to address the underrepresentation of minorities, and particularly of Native Hawaiian women, in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM disciplines) at UH Manoa and nationwide. The goal is to address the dual barriers of gender and ethnicity that Native Hawaiian females face in these fields."

Existing studies have shed some light on the ways that neighborhoods affect crime and other related problems, but have used a narrow definition of neighborhood environment that only includes the local area in which people live. This project recognizes that human social interactions do not take place at one time point and are not wholly contained within neighborhoods of residence. Rather, people move through a variety of dynamic local environments as they carry out their regular activities of going to work, school, child care, health care, informal socializing, and religious activities. These dynamic patterns of activity among people and communities produce more or less social isolation, which in turn, affects crime and other problem outcomes among young persons and adults. This research will: (1) use unique space- and time-use (i.e., activity pattern) information from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey and state-of-the-art Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to measure the extent and character of social isolation for individuals and communities; (2) describe how such social isolation varies by race, ethnicity, economic status, and neighborhood type; and (3) explore the consequences of individual and neighborhood social isolation for crime, delinquency, and problem behaviors at different points in the life course. An added benefit of the project will be the development of measurement tools that are applicable to a wide range of human behaviors across an array of disciplines. It will also enhance the training and careers of graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. The products from the research will include a conference with participants from multiple disciplines who are conducting research on the measurement, patterns, and consequences of space-time use for human problem and other behaviors, and the publication of a volume geared to academic and policy audiences."

This program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in an effort to introduce them to scientific research so as to encourage their continued engagement in the nation's scientific research and development enterprise. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects designed especially for the purpose. The REU program is a major contributor to the NSF's goal of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce. The Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) sciences Directorate awarded this REU Site grant to the University of California-Los Angeles in order to enhance undergraduate experience in scientific methods and analyses in a long-term research project at the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ifugao, Philippines. Students in this REU program are actively involved in investigating highland economic and political responses to the arrival of the Spanish in the northern Philippines. As an REU Site, the project recruits junior- and senior-level undergraduates from a wide-range of backgrounds, home institutions, ages, gender, and ethnicity, with emphasis on under-represented and female students. The PI-team strives to focus the recruitment on minority-serving institutions, including community colleges, by utilizing the institutional connections of the UCLA Academic Advancement Program-Center for Community College Partnerships. Students participating in the project are actively involved in the research design, data collection, and laboratory analysis of archaeologically retrieved materials. Students receive intensive training in archaeological field methods, faunal and botanical analyses, human osteology, and, artifact identification and cataloguing. Through the collaboration between UCLA (lead institution), University of Washington, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Philippines, the National Museum of the Philippines, and the Save the Ifugao Terraces Movement, Inc., students in this REU Site program receive intensive mentorship during and after the program.<br/><br/><br/>Although the Spanish failed to colonize the northern Philippine highlands, preliminary analysis of the archaeological record from Ifugao suggests drastic landscape and social transformations ensued after c. AD 1600. To determine the impacts of Spanish colonialism in highland Philippines, this research program conducts subsurface excavations, spatial modeling, and analyses of faunal and paleobotanical samples, artifacts, and human osteolical remains. The research program investigates the political and economic impacts of Spanish colonialism in highland Philippines, particularly, in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ifugao, Philippines, where the most extensive rice terraces in the world are located. Previous models suggest that the rice terraces are at least 2,000 years old. Recent archaeological information, however, indicates that the agricultural marvels were constructed after the arrival of the Spanish in the northern Philippines at c. AD 1600. In addition, rapid social and environmental change occurred in the region shortly after AD 1600. This research provides another perspective to our understanding of Spanish colonialism, which has largely focused on the Americas. The Ifugao rice terraces are rapidly deteriorating and the Ifugao people are losing both their tangible and intangible heritage to changes brought about by economic and political transformations. The rice terraces are examples of landesque and the assimilation of Ifugao social organization to that of the state together with the low status given to farmers and the rapid disappearance of traditional knowledge could further spell degradation of the terraces. One of the overarching goals of this study is to contribute to heritage conservation programs in Ifugao, in both tangible and intangible heritage. As such, this REU Site engages the community by promoting direct and active participation of descendant communities. The project also helps with the establishment of a community museum and on-site museum to complement the development of indigenous culture and history curriculum. In addition, this program aims to encourage undergraduate students to pursue STEM-related and anthropology graduate studies. The NSF International Science and Engineering (ISE) program co-funds this REU Site project."

For example, in the field of chemical engineering at the top 50 departments, African American and Hispanic women together made up less than 0.75 % of the reported ChE faculties; Native American Women were non-existent on chemical engineering faculties. This proposal directly addresses the goal of NSFs ADVANCE Program, which is to increase the representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering. <br/><br/>This proposal presents an initiative to bring together a group of women that are diverse in their race, ethnicity, discipline and institution type to conduct targeted peer mentoring and set in motion an infrastructure for discipline-specific career enhancement networks. The primary activity (over a three-year period) will be a series of professional development summits that are both discipline-specific and multidisciplinary. In the first year a 2-day summit will convene at NCSU for all engineering disciplines. In years 2-3, Discipline Cluster mini-summits will take place using a format designed at the first summit by women in their respective subject areas. In the final year there will be a summit to mark the culmination of the series under this grant and a strategic planning meeting to plan to move this endeavor out to the disciplines through either professional societies (if appropriate) or other channels. <br/><br/>Evaluation and project assessment will cover longer- term outcomes of the summit such as the development and utility of effective research and mentoring networks. <br/><br/> The broader impact of this effort will be seen in enhanced understanding of the factors contributing to the retention and advancement of women engineering faculty and in improved research and professional networks among a highly trained group of faculty who are often isolated in their professional settings in academic departments."

Initiated in 1994, CSU-LSAMP is a statewide program dedicated to broadening participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The current Senior-level CSU-LSAMP includes 22 of the 23 campuses of the California State University (CSU). The only CSU campus that is not included is The California Maritime Academy, which is a unique and specialized campus of the CSU. Hence, this project is truly a comprehensive effort of the CSU, the largest system of public higher education in the world, located in the largest and most diverse State in the Nation.<br/>Intellectual Merit: As a Senior-level LSAMP project, CSU-LSAMP aims to: (1) continue to enhance student performance, success, and retention in STEM disciplines; as well as maintain or increase baccalaureate degree production, (2) facilitate the transition of community college students in their first year of transfer to a CSU campus through activities that improve the retention rates of transfer students; (3) continue to enhance student interest in research and careers in STEM, as well as enhance the global awareness of CSU-LSAMP students. (4) increase the number of students who are admitted to graduate programs and obtain doctoral degrees in STEM, and (5) document, disseminate, and replicate undergraduate intervention models that increase access to, and success in, STEM baccalaureate degree programs and facilitate undergraduate admissions to STEM graduate programs.<br/>The types of activities that are offered to support each objective have consistently been shown to facilitate retention and progression of URM students in STEM, and represent a set of well-established ?best practices?. Notably, the project continues to include the top five LSAMP hallmark activities, which were identified in the Urban Institute?s national study of LSAMP (i.e., research experiences, mentoring, internships, scholarships/ stipends and academic support/tutoring). In addition, in light of the Urban Institute?s finding that LSAMP participants who participated in research were more likely to pursue and complete graduate degrees, this project includes a substantial emphasis on engaging students in research activities. The project also includes a variety of activities designed to opportunities to enhance student qualifications for graduate programs (e.g., GRE preparation, teaching experiences; research presentations, and internships), and collaborates with other student support programs on participating campuses (e.g., McNair and NIH-NIGMS Bridges to the Future programs) and with programs at Ph.D. granting institutions (e.g., AGEP) that share the goal of broadening participation in STEM.<br/>Broader Impacts: CSU-LSAMP has contributed substantially to broadening participation of underrepresented minority (URM) groups in STEM disciplines. Over the 14 year history of past CSU-LSAMP projects, the campuses participating in those projects awarded a total of 109,115 STEM baccalaureate degrees. Of these degrees, 18,513 STEM degrees were awarded to students who self declared as members of URM groups, 77,105 STEM degrees were awarded to students who self-declared as not being members of URM groups, and 13,497 STEM degrees were awarded to students who declined to provide race/ethnicity data. Although CSU-LSAMP does not limit participation to URM students or provide URM students preference in admission, the project anticipates that 85-90% of the 1600-2000 STEM students admitted to the project each year will be URM students. CSU-LSAMP also anticipates that, over the course of the project period, URM STEM baccalaureate degree production by the 22 CSU campuses in the Senior-level Alliance will increase from the current year base-line of 1,654 to at least 2,000/year and that the number of URM CSU-LSAMP participants who progress to graduate programs will increase from an estimated base-line of 95/year to 200/year by the end of the project period."

There has been ample qualitative research on the informal economy. However beginning in the early 1990's the investigators have developed, refined, and implemented a technique that allows for quantitative analysis of informal work via structured surveys administered to samples of adult individuals. The study will conduct the first nationally representative household survey of informal work in the United States.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of this study is to provide an empirical examination of the contours and correlates of informal work at the national-level. We have seven basic research questions. How prevalent is informal work in the United States? How does the prevalence of informal work vary spatially (for example, across the rural-urban continuum)? What is the relationship between household labor supply in the formal economy (both in terms of quantity and quality) and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between poverty, income, and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between social capital (for example, the strength of a household's social networks) and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between standard correlates of formal labor market stratification (for example, family size, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment) and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between industrial restructuring in the formal economy and participation in informal work?<br/><br/>Data will be collected through a telephone survey administered to a nationally representative sample of up to 1,700 adults. The survey instrument will be anchored around a set of survey items that ask about participation in several specific forms of informal work. In addition, the instrument will gather basic socio-demographic and economic information about sampled households, and geo-coding will allow us to merge and incorporate contextual information on place of residence. <br/><br/>The study will make important scientific contributions. It will be the first to provide reliable and generalizable evidence about the prevalence, importance and correlates of informal work, and to provide definitive evidence concerning several empirical and debated questions such as how informal work varies with formal labor supply, social capital of households, poverty status, and rural-urban residence. The broader impact of the study includes providing basic information on an important yet neglected economic survival strategy among households in the United States today. Research findings carry important implications for social policy as well. In recent years, entrepreneurship and small-business enterprise have been touted as viable economic strategies for households and their communities that may be struggling amidst industrial restructuring and attenuated support for social welfare programs. It is important therefore to understand informal work as a potential source of entrepreneurial vitality."

It both builds and marks an advance on decades of important study devoted to the question of why some social problems draw a great deal of attention from government officials, the public, and the media while other problems receive little notice (Baumgartner and Jones 1993; Best 1990; Blumer 1971; Cobb and Ross 1997; Gusfield 1981; Hilgartner and Bosk 1988; Kingdon 1995; Schattschneider 1975; Schneider and Ingram 1993; Spector and Kitsuse 1973; Walker 1977). One body of work emphasizes the characteristics of problems themselves as important determinants of attention. <br/><br/>This research has helped to underscore how the groups in society who are burdened by problems and the organized advocates who take an interest in problems affect the attention those problems receive; problems are constructed through a ihsocial process.le Other work on agenda-setting, however, focuses on aspects of the attention allocation process that help determine which problems receive attention. This research has demonstrated how temporal dynamics as well as the interplay between various sub-agendas (e.g., Congress, the media) affect which problems make their way into the public arena. Despite the evidence that aspects of both process and problem are integral to the phenomenon of attention allocation, researchers have tended to focus solely on one of these dimensions. Thus, empirical generalizations tend to emerge from incomplete or misspecified models. <br/><br/>The proposed project proceeds theoretically from the idea that the phenomenon of allocating attention to problems is a complex function both of problem characteristics (such as problem burden, the size and nature of organized communities associated with a problem, and a problem's cultural valence), and of process-oriented dynamics (such as the relationships that exist among the agendas of different institutions; the temporal dynamics of agenda setting, and the relationships between different problems jockeying for agenda space). Empirically, the project proposes to compare the attention given to multiple problems over time in different arenas in order to discriminate between the process-oriented and problem-oriented determinants of the attention allocation process. <br/><br/>This is accomplished by studying attention to 37 different diseases by the media, by government, and by the scientific community across 25 years. Disease offers a powerful lens to view the problem-specific and process-related dynamics of the attention generating process because diseases are both medical facts and social constructions, and because diseases have clearly defined outcomes, like hospitalization or death, so that their severity can be gauged with a common metric.<br/><br/>This study of the problem- and process-oriented determinants of agenda setting offers both scholarly and practical rewards. The research design promises to advance the theoretical and empirical understanding of both social problem construction and agenda setting. Moreover, because of the specific focus on disease, the findings will address major policy issues: how the government responds to public health priorities, as reflected in the media and via organized interest groups; how disparities in disease burden by race/ethnicity, sex and age shape priorities; how these priorities inform the complex decisions made by pharmaceutical companies, both in their research and development of new drugs and in their marketing of existing ones; and how government budgetary decisions might reflect (if not magnify) these priorities. More broadly, the proposed project speaks to how societal resources are selectively allocated across a field of seemingly equally attention-worthy social problems."

Across this spectrum fascinating new types of user interfaces, technologies, and concepts are beginning to emerge. The field is highly interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together technologists, educators, humanists, artists and social scientists, among others. ISMAR is one of the largest meetings devoted to the advancement of mixed reality, augmented reality, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction with the physical world, and encourages six different submission types: Papers and Posters, Workshops, Panels, Tutorials, Demonstrations and Contests. Because of the diverse fields relevant to mixed and augmented reality, ISMAR content is organized in two tracks: The Science & Technology (S&T) program and The Arts, Media and Humanities (AMH) program. The top papers are often extended, reviewed, and submitted for publication in the prestigious IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. More information about the conference may be found at http://ismar.vgtc.org/. <br/><br/>This will be the first Doctoral Consortium held in conjunction with an ISMAR symposium. The goal is to provide the students with an opportunity at a critical time in their careers to present their work to a group of mentors and peers from a diverse set of academic and industrial institutions, to receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the ISMAR community. To these ends participants will be asked to prepare both a technical presentation and a poster describing their work. A pre-event social dinner on Sunday evening will allow the attendees (students, mentors and organizers) to get to know each other. On Monday morning the attendees will meet for an informal breakfast at 8:00 AM, after which each student participant will have 50 minutes devoted to his/her research, beginning with a presentation for approximately 30 minutes followed by about 20 minutes reserved for an extensive discussion with the other graduate student participants and the senior researchers. The discussion will be facilitated by the Doctoral Consortium co-chairs and mentors, with the goal of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the research, challenges and issues, implications of the results, potential suggestions for additional approaches or follow-on work, and career guidance related to the student's work and area. The posters will be on display during the main ISMAR conference poster sessions (in which the students will be expected to participate), and will be marked as being part of the Doctoral Consortium. All results from the Consortium, including the procedures followed, will be archived in an ISMAR 2012 DC binder as a reference for the next year's conference.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The organizers will take steps to achieve a diversity of research topics, disciplinary backgrounds, methodological approaches, and home institutions among the students to ensure that they meet people outside their own specific area. Factors such as gender and ethnicity will also be taken into account, with an emphasis on including underrepresented groups. To further increase diversity up to half the student participants may be invited from abroad but NSF funds will be used to support the 4 expected students from U.S. institutions of higher learning plus one international student; the organizers will work with colleagues in Europe and Asia to secure other funding for the remaining international students."

It will be co-located with the 2015 iConference hosted by the University of California-Irvine and held in Newport Beach, California on March 24-27, 2015. The iConferences, the annual meetings of the iSchool community, are a leading forum that brings together faculty, students, research staff, and industry practitioners with a common interest in supporting and augmenting human engagement with information and technology. Open to broad participation, the iConferences have been successful in building a sense of community around the information field, bringing together people who otherwise might rarely interact with one another, and helping promote their interdisciplinary research. More information about the iConference may be found online at http://ischools.org/the-iconference/.<br/><br/>The 2015 iConference Doctoral Colloquium will be a meeting of 27 selected Ph.D. candidates studying all aspects of information science, along with approximately 9 distinguished faculty mentors. Colloquium activities will be woven throughout the conference, starting with an orientation on March 25th and culminating in an all-day event on 27th. The core of the event will be mentor-led, peer-critique sessions of dissertation research projects held in small four-person teams. The primary objective of the Doctoral Colloquium is to help train the next generation of information science researchers. To this end, it will provide the student participants with an environment in which they can share and discuss their goals, methods and results at an early stage of their research. By participating in the doctoral colloquium, students will gain feedback on their work both from the mentors and from other students, which should allow them to enhance their research. Students will also develop a better understanding of the different research communities engaged in the study of information science, and learn how to position their work within the community. In addition, the colloquium will provide students with opportunities to make new professional connections beyond their own disciplines and institutions. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The iConference doctoral colloquia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of researchers in information science, allowing them to develop a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Participation is encouraged from a broad range of relevant disciplines, thereby expanding attendees' perspectives on their topics of study and promoting advancement of the field. The organizers will proactively work to maximize diversity along such key dimensions as institution type, research topics, methodological approaches, disciplinary traditions, gender, ethnicity, and national or cultural backgrounds."

The questions to be asked have to do with whether Native American museums can play dynamic roles in relation to living culture of Native American communities, or whether they treat their culture as historic relics not relevant to contemporary life. This research is important because the tension between local minority cultures and the national majority culture is a fact of life relevant to all nation states. Increased understanding of how local cultures defend their own interests and maintain their cultural distinctiveness while at the same time interacting with national political institutions will help planners design programs which can productively satisfy both local and national cultural and political concerns."

For instance, while cross-country linkages between financial markets can be beneficial for diversification it also opens up the possibility of contagion of bad outcomes. In general, the network structure may determine which of several possible economic outcomes or `equilibria' are chosen and it may also affect the speed with which coordination on a particular equilibrium occurs. Besides studying behavior for a given network structure, the endogenous emergence of efficient network structures has also become an important theoretical research topic. To date, however, there has been little research of an applied nature. In this project we empirically test this theoretical work using controlled laboratory experiments with paid human subjects. <br/><br/>These experiments advance our knowledge of whether network structures matter for equilibrium selection, and whether and when certain network structures arise endogenously. These are critical questions that lie at the heart of many poorly understood issues including the susceptibility of financial and other systems to ``panics'', sorting by gender, race or ethnicity, the emergence of trading patterns and trade agreements, technological adoption and ``lock-in'' to inferior technologies, and organizational design."

Mobile home residents are disproportionately affected by tornadoes. They make up about 6% of the population of the United States, but account for about 45% of tornado deaths. Previous studies investigated what people knew about tornadoes or how they perceived danger from tornadoes. This project takes a different approach and focuses on what people know about sheltering strategies and how they perceive the effectiveness of those actions in preventing harm. For example, people who believe they are not able to carry out sufficient actions to protect themselves from a tornado may develop negative attitudes toward sheltering behavior. Such negative attitudes can lead them to ignore warnings and put themselves at greater risk from tornadoes. The first goal of this project is to identify a few common sets of attitudes and beliefs about tornado sheltering within mobile home communities. This will be accomplished by a series of interviews with mobile home residents in South Carolina, where mobile homes are as prominent in the housing sector as any other state in the United States. After the interviews, a questionnaire will be mailed to random occupied mobile home units in South Carolina; this will provide data for the remaining goals of the project. A second goal is to discover if certain types of attitudes and beliefs are more prevalent in different sectors of the population. For example, the study will investigate gender, age, race and ethnicity, family structure, education, mobility, and several other factors to determine how these relate to attitudes and beliefs about taking shelter from tornadoes. This project will also research whether mobile home residents living in different geographic situations have different tornado sheltering strategies. Many mobile homes are situated in and near urban areas within mobile home parks containing dozens of units. However, there are also large numbers of mobile homes in rural areas which are single-sited units situated in areas with fewer roads and nearby sturdy structures. The final goal of this project is to find out what mobile home residents intend to do when tornadoes threaten, and to understand which factors discussed above are most important in their decisions as to what to do. This will enable the building of a conceptual framework for how mobile home residents develop tornado sheltering plans and take action, or why they fail to do so.<br/><br/>This project benefits society by fostering awareness and education to reduce the number of deaths and injuries in mobile homes as a result of tornadoes. The interview and questionnaire data will be made available to researchers and practitioners interested in the issue of tornado sheltering. Results of the study will be presented at national meetings attended by meteorologists from the National Weather Service, emergency managers from federal, state, and local agencies, and other researchers. The findings will inform new education and outreach programs, as well as aid in improving communication between the public and those in the emergency management and meteorology sectors. The methodologies used in this study will provide an example for future work to investigate mobile home resident tornado sheltering in other regions of the United States. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this study also provides support enabling a promising student to establish a career as an independent researcher."

Predicting the responses of the earth and biological systems to rising temperatures and the complex mixture of increasing gases (carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide) is challenging as it is difficult to control these multiple parameters and create replicated experiments, especially on a scale large enough to study biological communities. How elevations in trace gases will affect the capacity of communities to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is unknown. Changes in atmospheric composition over geologic time have been hypothesized to drive major evolutionary changes, but these hypotheses are difficult to evaluate without experimental tests of atmospheric composition on organisms. Air pollutants have been implicated in the dramatic recent elevations in respiratory diseases like asthma, but facilities for experimentally testing the effect of atmospheric composition are insufficient. This award, jointly funded by the National Science Foundation's BIO and GEO directorates, will support a workshop to discuss the design and implementation of a national facility to study the effects of atmospheric composition and climate on biological and earth processes. The workshop participants constitute a diverse group of scientists in terms of scientific expertise, gender, geographic origin, ethnicity, and career stages. In addition, representatives from a variety of potential federal funding agencies will attend the workshop."

This leads to simplified, tractable computations and produces simulations of outputs that correspond to specific choices of inputs. However, most physical, biological, social, economic, financial, etc. processes involve some degree of uncertainty. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the task of determining statistical information about the outputs of a process of interest, given only statistical (i.e., incomplete) information about the inputs. The particular focus of the workshop are processes governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). It has long been recognized that mathematical models need to account for such uncertainties. However, the science of UQ in many application areas is still in its infancy. There is much current activity in disparate areas of mathematics, statistics, science, and engineering that is relevant to UQ. However, fundamental and challenging mathematical issues remain unsolved, in particular combating the ""curse of dimensionality"" attendant to solving problems in high dimensions remains an unresolved issue. The workshop is meant to help ameliorate this situation. The workshop brings together experts in all areas of mathematics and statistics relevant to UQ as well as scientists and engineers working in application areas. The objectives of the workshop are as follows: to review developments in this rapidly developing field; to bring together internationally leading experts working in relevant fields of mathematics, statistics, and other areas and enable an effective dialogue between them; to expose industrial researchers to the recent developments in the field and mathematical scientists to the important problems facing industry; to promote communication between the various relevant mathematical disciplines (e.g., numerical analysis, probability theory, statistics, high-performance computing); to encourage junior researchers to work in the field; and to strengthen interactions between researchers coming from different areas of research. The workshop commences with three short courses that are meant to get everyone up to speed on the disparate aspects of UQ and stochastic PDEs considered in the workshop. Although the short courses are of value for everyone attending the workshop, they are especially valuable for junior researchers. The workshop closes with a session devoted to a discussion of future directions in stochastic PDE and UQ research with a special emphasis on the outstanding open problems that need to be solved in order to make stochastic PDE-based UQ a tool that is easily, routinely, and readily available to those in government and industry that have to make decisions in environments involving risk and uncertainty. <br/><br/>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of accurately assessing the uncertainties in predictions made by scientists and engineers about physical, biological, social, economic, financial, military, etc. processes. For example, predicting hurricane paths, the structural integrity of a bridge or airplane, future prices of financial instruments, and the lifetime to failure of military equipment are all subject to uncertainty. Thus, accurately quantifying that uncertainty is of paramount importance to engineers in the design process, to government officials when making policy decisions including those related to homeland security and military strategies, to response teams assessing dangers and remedies in natural and man-made disaster situations, and in many other settings. The workshop objective is to advance the state of the art of the science of UQ. The objective is met by bringing together mathematicians, statisticians, engineers, and scientists from universities and industry to exchange ideas and to develop new methodologies. A significant and effective transfer of knowledge to the users of scientific UQ is also affected. The organizers of the workshop are committed to include a diverse, with respect to rank, gender, age, and ethnicity, set of participants in the workshop. There is also a well-formulated plan for the timely and effective dissemination of information about developments occurring at the workshop. The workshop closes with a session devoted to a discussion of future directions in UQ research with a special emphasis on the outstanding open problems that need to be solved in order to make stochastic PDE-based UQ a tool that is easily, routinely, and readily available to those in government and industry that have to make decisions in environments involving risk and uncertainty."

Her focus will be on how differences in religion, culture, ethnicity, race, gender, and class produce differential refugee experiences in a non-traditional relocation site. Skin color varies from dark (Southern Sudanese), to lighter (Roma Bosnians), to very light (majority Bosnians). The Bosnians self-identify as Muslims while the Southern Sudanese are primarily Christians. The social service institutions differ in that one is a private church-related social service agency and the other is a public welfare agency. Recent social science scholarship has found that the concept of citizenship is not universal but is variably applied to people with different characteristics. Her goal is to understand how the different characteristics of the refugees affect how they are viewed as citizens or potential citizens, and how citizenship processes affect access their resources.<br/><br/>The researcher will employ comparative, qualitative social science methodologies during twelve months of field research. She will collect data through participant observation at local events, in neighborhoods, and through volunteer work. She will conduct individual and group interviews with refugees, caseworkers and other agency employees, and a sample of Fargo residents. Additional semi-structured interviews will be done to collect life histories and kinship information. She will use text analysis techniques to analyze reports concerning refugees in print and non-print media. <br/><br/>In a period of intense debate about immigration, the research will provide a timely opportunity to better understand how differential notions of citizenship affect the potential for refugees to be integrated successfully into mainstream society. The research will contribute to changing social science theory about citizenship and the state. It also will support the education of a social scientist."

The global economy is in the midst of large-scale transformation driven by innovations in IT and the explosive growth of the Internet. IT is reshaping markets and consumer and enterprise behavior, while at the same time business realities determine which IT innovations are viable. Little is yet known about the economic and social impacts of this transformation. Significant new research is needed on various types of IT-enhanced economic environments, including: markets with asynchronous participation; markets with automated agents; new market formats enabled by IT; and new composite information services. Automated trading agents play an increasing role in the IT-enabled markets, and their interaction with human traders demands close scrutiny.<br/><br/>The methods to be employed in this project include the development of new theoretical models and the testing and refinement of the models in controlled experiments with human subjects. To date, the most detailed scientific knowledge of trader behavior and market performance is confined to classic market formats and to very simple goods. This research will expand that classical knowledge, test its robustness, and open new lines of inquiry by considering a broader range of market formats (one-sided auctions, two-sided markets and new hybrids), a broader range of goods (including new composite IT service products), and a broader range of behavior (including human interaction with automated agents).<br/><br/>The scientific knowledge generated by the research will disseminate swiftly into the community of e-commerce practitioners, and will help provide a sounder basis for integrating IT into the world economy. The platforms for running the various market formats and automated agents will be incorporated into the National Science Digital Library, enhancing infrastructure for teaching and research. Teaching, training and learning will be promoted directly for numerous graduate students who serve as research assistants and programmers; some undergraduates will also help with the programming and hundreds will serve as laboratory subjects who become experienced in market trading and controlling market agents. Given the ethnicity of students at the campuses, and given the history of employment at the labs, a large share of the educational benefits are likely to accrue to women and members of minority groups."

Finally, by creating a collaborative interdisciplinary environment within academia and across the healthcare delivery, HIT (Health Information Technology) corporate and academic sectors; the rapid translation of health discoveries into the practice environment to improve quality and safety of patient care will be facilitated. This project uses a technology solution to address a heretofore largely unsolved problem, viz., expedient and efficient translation of relevant research to nursing practice. The translation problem for nursing will be accomplished through the efforts of a strong inter-disciplinary team of nursing, computer science, informatics, and management researchers and with multisector partners. <br/><br/>The methods developed in this project may further be tested and applied to other areas of health care practice, particularly where there is a need for application of evidence from multiple domains, such as the practice of public health related to diseases of animals that can be transmitted to humans. There has been increasing regulatory and scientific attention to patient safety and quality in health care. There is the expectation that computer-aided clinical decision support will contribute to quality improvement and the reduction of medical errors. Underrepresented groups will benefit from changes to health practice engendered by this project, as the Knowledge Repository includes information about the gender and ethnicity of those who participated in the studies included.

The long term goal of this is project is aimed at identifying and developing changes to university policies and practices to better serve and represent its changing academic workers in terms of gender and ethnicity. The goals of the program are to bring awareness of barriers to women?s and underrepresented groups? advancement across STEM fields. The data gathered in this effort will help to institutionalize positive changes at the university level and identify department-specific barriers in order to increase overall participation and advancement of women and minority faculty to senior and leadership ranks. Activities targeting the culture, practices and structures that impede advancement of women faculty can only be successful through the intervention of the faculty within STEM departments, who are best positioned to collaborate with university leadership to improve persistent organizational problems. Through its partnerships with regional institutions in Oklahoma, OSU plans to expand the network of institutions and individuals from other STEM underrepresented groups, such as African Americans and Native Americans, to equip them with knowledge in order to empower them to begin addressing the under representation of women in academic science and engineering. <br/><br/>Project activities will include (1) Mentoring and networking programs that span STEM departments, including a two-tier mentoring program to enhance career development for women and for faculty of color; (2) University-wide programs and workshops aimed at increasing career flexibility and culturally sensitive interventions; (3) Workshops for STEM faculty from OSU and regional institutions; and, (4) OSU ADVANCE website that includes best practices, research, electronic newsletter. Given OSU's partnership with a regional HBCU and three tribal colleges, this initiative will also contribute to the development of adapting these interventions to include underrepresented groups in removing barriers for women in STEM <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the OSU Advance Partnership are significant and wide ranging. In addition to addressing the under representation of women in senior faculty and leadership positions in STEM areas at OSU, we expect to enhance recruitment and retention of women in junior faculty positions as well. This program of actions and interventions will provide an important and tested model for wider applications in supporting and promoting the success and advancement of women in STEM fields. The scientific work force of the United States will be vitally enhanced by ensuring that women and people of color, two rapidly growing segments of the labor force, are positioned to assume positions of leadership in STEM fields at OSU and nationally. Students at OSU, both undergraduate and graduate, will be an important part of data collection and analysis. This will, in turn, both advance their academic experience and training, as well as providing them the opportunity to participate in transformational research and interventions. We are committed to ensuring the highest level of diversity in recruiting student researchers from traditionally under-represented groups. We would note that OSU has one of the largest Native American student populations in the United States in addition to other traditionally underrepresented student populations. The PI and co-PIs have worked closely with the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program (OK-LSAMP), NABS (Native Americans in Biological Sciences), SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science, and similar student and professional programs."

In both the U.S. and Japan we are seeing the first successful commercial remote presence robots, but these efforts are rudimentary and primarily involve adding limited indoor mobility and the ability to direct a camera at a video conference screen. For the potential of the field to be realized, research is sorely needed to better understand complex issues such as the nature of remote social embodiment, how human-looking the robots should be, the psychological impacts of remote robot presence for the user as well as the interlocutor, what sorts of user interfaces mitigate cognitive load, and how to better support situational awareness. New directions in remote presence research could include other robot abilities such as outdoor mobility and dexterity. In addition, potential societal impacts and ethical considerations need to be addressed, especially when telepresence robot technologies are designed for applications targeting vulnerable populations (e.g., children and the elderly). Finally, telepresence robots have global implications, in that they will allow people from different cultures and different countries to interact both physically and socially. Someday, telepresence robots may even be endowed with knowledge of language, culture, and non-verbal communication cues from multiple cultures so that they can carry out multimodal, fully embodied translation. Thus, this joint Japanese-U.S. workshop is both timely and important. It will build upon two prior preliminary meetings on the topic, and bring together a diverse set of researchers who can speak to the issues from a technical, human, and global/societal standpoint. Workshop participants will share their research experiences and findings, and identify a set of challenge problems that can guide ongoing research in this field. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Participation in the workshop will be by invitation. The Japanese delegation will consist of leading researchers in human-robot interaction from some of their top universities. U.S. participants have been carefully selected because they either have done research in tele-presence robots, have worked with social robots in the context of special populations (e.g., children, the elderly, the physically disabled, or people with learning disabilities), or can speak to societal or ethical considerations. The organizers have taken pains to promote diversity with respect to gender (half of the U.S. invitees are women) and ethnicity (two are Asian, one is of Hispanic background, and one is African American). About ten graduate students will also be included in order to foster new learning and training experiences for young researchers; again, the selection will be based on their interest in the workshop topic and also on diversity considerations. The primary workshop outcomes will be a white paper that summarizes the key ideas resulting from the meeting, including challenge problems that should define a research roadmap for the field. Presentation materials will be gathered and made available to participants, with the goal of fostering a community dialog that crosses international boarders and academic disciplines."

Urban landscapes are excellent settings within which to examine interactions ecological and human communities. Urban areas that have experienced a traumatic event can be highly tractable systems for studying potential parallels between ecological and socioeconomic systems as well as feedbacks among them. With acute trauma resulting in an initial state change, the assembly and reassembly of proximate or coincident urban ecological and human communities can be a coupled dynamic, where outcomes are contingent on responses to common forcing factors or interactions arising from management interventions. The catastrophic flooding of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina resulted in a natural laboratory for investigating assembly and reassembly of coupled natural and human systems. The investigators will determine the extent to which ecological and socioeconomic diversity exhibited parallel responses to Katrina-related flooding. They also will examine how interventions executed as public health measures shaped relationships and interactions between ecological and socioeconomic diversity. They will conduct geographic information system-based analyses of landscape heterogeneity and socioeconomic variation before and after Hurricane Katrina as well as plot-based inventories of post-Katrina plant communities while accounting for flooding and socioeconomic stratification. They will examine the ecology and demography of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), a habitat-dependent primary reservoir of zoonotic pathogens, in order to understand human health outcomes of flooding. This facet of the research will involve a trap-based census; population genetic analysis of abundance and dispersal, and histological analysis of pathogen prevalence. Mail surveys and in-person interviews of households proximate to plant inventory and trapping sites as well as households in four neighborhoods having different income and ethnicity characteristics will be administered to determine how perceptions of risk compare to physical measures of exposure risk across the city. Information gained from these studies will be integrated into a spatially explicit predictive model of Norway rat demography to assess ecological and human-health outcomes of alternative control scenarios reflecting habitat suitability, movement, and risk perceptions.<br/><br/>Trauma can have enduring consequences on environments and societies. Understanding the interplay between ecological and human communities will better prepare societies to anticipate and manage trauma inflicted by catastrophic events. This project will help catalyze conceptual unification of disparate fields of research on the composition, assembly, and structure of communities, and it will generate new information and insights needed to foster and inform societal action at a time when unprecedented resources are being invested to rebuild New Orleans. By involving community partners, cross-university academic and public outreach programs will provide opportunities to promote awareness of trauma, diversity, and public health across stakeholder and underrepresented groups in the city. With urbanization placing an increasingly greater proportion of the global population at risk because of catastrophic events, lessons about the traumas experienced by New Orleans will provide new knowledge of scholarly and practical value to residents and decision makers in communities around the world.

Generally, the volatility and chaos occurring immediately after a trauma are followed by a relative stabilization, usually at levels and configurations different from the pre-trauma ""normal."" This exploratory research project will investigate the impact of trauma on urban ecological and social systems using post-Katrina New Orleans as a study area. The investigators will use ecological and social measures to track and characterize the transition from trauma to stabilization. Data will be analyzed to measure patterns of ecological and social diversification. ""Ecological diversification"" refers to species richness and dominance, community structure and composition, succession stage, land cover, and other measures. ""Social diversification"" tracks human population differentiation in terms of class (median household income), race, ethnicity, age, education, nativity, gender, renter/homeowner status, and other metrics. Toward this end, the investigators have identified two major research objectives. The first will entail a GIS-based spatial analysis of pre- and post-trauma landscape and social metrics derived from satellite imagery and the 2000 and 2010 federal census. These data will be analyzed for diversification and compared to stabilization metrics. This citywide study will be supplemented with three fine-grained studies in the neighborhoods of the Lower Ninth Ward, Hollygrove, and Pontchartrain Park. Qualitative data collected in these neighborhoods will provide insight into the relationships between trauma and ecological and social diversity, and identify variation in the timing, pace, and trajectory of neighborhood recovery. The second objective will involve the organization and coordination of a network of scholars and practitioners to exchange experience and knowledge and thereby increase understanding of the complex interactions and connections among trauma, human actions, and urban ecosystems.<br/><br/>This project will yield several empirical, theoretical, and practical contributions to understanding the interactions of humans and natural ecosystems. Empirically, this project will provide extensive numerical data and analyses on social diversification and post-trauma stabilization at detailed spatial scales. Theoretically, it will identify feedbacks and reciprocal effects among patterns of post-trauma urbanization, ecological consequences, and human responses. Practically, it will establish a broad-based, interdisciplinary research program that will identify the human and natural system drivers of post-trauma urban ecosystem changes and develop strategies for responding to these changes. With respect to broader impacts of the proposed research, the project will involve an interdisciplinary team of ecologists, biologists, sociologists, geographers, anthropologists, a civil engineer, a trauma psychologist, a U.S. Forest Service researcher, and urban planners plus members of the community who bring traditional knowledge to the project. By leveraging the research and education resources of three major universities (Tulane University, the University of New Orleans, and Xavier University, a major HBCU), this research will foster unique collaborations between ecologists and social scientists and will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in generating new knowledge about human-natural system interactions. This award was funded as an Urban Long-Term Research Area Exploratory (ULTRA-Ex) award as the result of a special competition jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service."

This dissertation investigates how controversy has affected the development of human behavior genetics and asks why some working in this field have placed group (e.g., race) differences and particular complex behaviors at the center of their research agendas. Using a sociology of knowledge approach, I explore the strategies employed by competing members of the field to acquire resources, set up norms for conduct, and establish factual claims. I investigate the ways public controversy has been both an outcome of and an influence on these strategies. I explore how controversy has marked the field's identity and map its relative autonomy from non-scientific influences and other scientific fields. To reconstruct these strategies, the competing factual claims, and the changing norms of the field, I conduct thirty interviews with key participants in the field and analyze relevant scientific articles from the late-1960s to the present. To measure the impact of these effects, I conduct limited citation, publication, media, and funding analyses during the same period. Finally, I attend annual meetings of the Behavior Genetics Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the World Congress on Psychiatric Genetics to observe the current concerns and interactions of field members. The results of this study will contribute to sociological scholarship on science, race, culture, and organizations. Its broader impacts include understanding how social and biological sciences can cooperate more productively to address social problems and how researchers investigating contentious topics might avoid unnecessary public controversy."

The major educational objective of this project is to establish an undergraduate curricular sequence starting from teaching genomics and bioinformatics, through collaborative class project to fostering independent and original research by the undergraduates. Participation in undergraduate research activities and authorship, along with academic achievement are among the significant factors mediating the effect of race/ethnicity in the scientific career choices. <br/><br/>The major research objective is incorporated into the curricular sequence and will result in an on-line map of human genome diversity across the island of Puerto Rico. The long-term goal is to create independent researchers through implementing dozens of student-initiated projects that will be communicated in various forms, including platform presentation participation in undergraduate research symposia, presentations at national meetings, online reports and peer-reviewed publications. Endpoints and outcomes such as test grades, pre- and post- evaluation of the general knowledge on the topic, perceptions of the research experience, evaluation of the course, mentorship, and recommendations to other students, as well as attitude towards entering graduate schools or other careers related to STEM disciplines, will be recorded for all participants. These outcomes will be correlated with the socioeconomic status and the career choice attitudes before, during and after application of the courses."

Questions that follow from this include: What mechanisms promote homogeneity or heterogeneity in political choice in neighborhoods or work groups? In what ways do the social contexts of work, recreation, or neighborhood life filter the perception of politically relevant information coming from the mass media or other persons? What mechanisms of social interaction enhance or inhibit social influences on political choice? In the highly dynamic context of a political campaign, how does the political influence of social context evolve over time? What mechanisms govern the changing course of social influence on political choice during a campaign? To address these questions the investigators have undertaken a three wave panel survey of 1,500 voters in South Bend, Indiana, before, during, and after the 1984 election campaign. A supplemental survey of almost 1,000 persons identified by respondents as political discussion partners was also completed. This survey employed a research design and sampling technique that differed markedly from traditional practice. Extensive scientific study of mass political behavior, especially voting behavior, has been undertaken over the past four decades utilizing national random sample survey techniques. The current investigation differs from this methodology in two important respects. First, the research site is a particular urban community. Second, the sampling design randomizes respondent selection, but within purposefully chosen neighborhoods that differ systematically in social and economic composition. A high sampling rate within each neighborhood allows the investigators to characterize each neighborhood environment. This design is believed to be unique in the study of voting behavior in that it provides for direct, comprehensive measurement of the social, attitudinal, economic, and political characteristics of the voter's immediate social milieu. The data set resulting fom these procedures provides analytic opportunities unavailable in the usual national election studies. In the determinants of voter choice or policy attitudes, measurements of respondents' social contexts may be introduced directly into the analysis. The relative importance of individual properties compared with the political influence arising from the social composition of the respondent's neighborhood can be assessed. For example, a body of evidence suggests that vote choice by working class respondents is heavily influenced not only by their working class membership but also by the concentration of working class families in their living areas. This classic effect of social context on voting behavior can be specified in extraordinary detail with the data set now available from South Bend. What mechanisms of social interaction drive this observed amplification of working class influence on individual members of the working class? Is it the composition of their political discussion networks? Is it the composition of their work groups? Is it the homogeneity of other social cleavages within their neighborhoods - - race, religion, ethnicity? Such questions can be raised, and given answers in first approximation, with these data."

IAP eliminates four roadblocks--lack of time, education and learning, social networks, and publication delays--that are major barriers to translational research, patenting, entrepreneurial team recruiting, new company formation, and funding. IAP uses a team of scientific post doctoral fellows with exposure to technology transfer and commercialization in the regions from which they are recruited to support researchers during the critical period of idea evolution. The Fellows' job will be to complete activities that the researchers may not have the time, inclination, or expertise to do. In the process, they will educate these researchers and increase their understanding of future invention disclosure and translational research. IAP engages the region's most experienced and proven leaders who know how to create a dynamic innovation environment with broad support. This leadership team has recruited seven universities, developed a plan to connect 10 pieces of established infrastructure, created the potential for collaboration with 16 industry partners, and gained support from 12 public and government members. The leadership team and the fellows will be supported by an advisory board comprised of entrepreneurs, members of industry, service providers, and investors. Six new tools have been developed to support this effort and simplify replication. Formal classroom training, peer teaching, social networks, mentoring, and free market feedback will be used. <br/><br/>NSF-PFI resource adequacy and value will be validated by contributions from industry, ensuring the sustainability and expansion of IAP. Only 30% of IAP's total five year cost will come from NSF. IAP will create a sustainable innovative commercialization structure in the St. Louis region. Teaching, training and learning occur in four ways with IAP: 1) Fellows complete rigorous curricular training; 2) the six tools support peer teaching and IAP replication; 3) frequent mentoring sessions, advisory board sessions, and industry meetings create social interactions and knowledge sharing; and 4) IAP will intersect students, underrepresented groups, industry, and university co-curricular programs so learning is shared. The very nature of the program breaks down the barriers to entry based on gender, ethnicity, and geography. It will provide experiences and role models for underrepresented populations not currently involved in science and innovation. IAP results and methods will be disseminated broadly. IAP will be offered to other regions in the country, particularly those less entrepreneurially mature. The success of the program will come from the basic premise that including everyone only serves to guarantee greater outcomes for all. <br/><br/>Partners include Washington University (lead institution), University of Missouri-Rolla, University of Illinois Edwardsville, St. Louis Arch Angels, Nidus Center for Scientific Enterprise, Prolog Ventures, Lopata Flegel & Company, Pfizer, Missouri Venture Forum, Rivervest, Biogenerator, Kauffman Foundation, St. Louis County Economic Council, and St. Louis RGCA."

The study will be carried out in Kazakhstan, where the government of Kazakhstan officially encourages repatriation. However, the return of Kazakhs from Mongolia to their historic homeland has had unexpected consequences, because state policies have not always connected well with local priorities. This situation has provoked radical new discussions of what constitutes ethnicity, belonging, and citizenship, making it an excellent opportunity for a micro-scale examination of return migration and its social and political effects. <br/><br/>In Kazakhstan, conceptions and practices of citizenship are illuminated through analysis of discursive constructions of kinship and hospitality, which are regarded as essential parts of Kazakh nomadic heritage. Therefore, the researcher will use the methods of both cultural and linguistic anthropology to explore conceptions of kinship and hospitality and their relation to ideas and practices of citizenship and national belonging. She will do participant observation, living with a local family and accomanying other returnees on visits back to Mongolia. She will conduct interviews with new returnees, other local residents, and officials; collect migration and life histories; and monitor and analyze media accounts. <br/><br/>This research is important because return migration is found throughout the world. Social science can help to explain the relationship between locally situated identifications and practices and how those connect or fail to connect with the symbolic and practical emplacement of people within larger frameworks, such as citizenship, nationhood, and state. The research also will contribute to the education of a graduate student."

Its focus is on the development of a positive physics identity (students' perceptions of themselves in relation to this field in terms of competence, performance, persistence, interest, and recognition by others) among high school students, particularly females, as a means to increase their academic performance. <br/><br/>Preliminary data analysis from an ongoing NSF-funded project (GSE/RES 0624444) suggests a strong correlation between the physics identity construct (e.g., Do you see yourself as a physics person?) and the study's proposed physics identity measures (i.e., performance, competence, recognition, and interest). Although most students, especially females, conveyed depressed attitudes toward themselves as physics learners, as well as toward the discipline, those who expressed favorable perceptions toward physics learning identified a set of activities that appear to affect the development of a positive physics identity: (a) focus on conceptual understanding, (b) frequency of laboratory activities that address their beliefs, (c) frequency of opportunities to share and interact, (d) teacher encouragement, and (e) holding discussions on current relevant science topics.<br/><br/>The PI hypothesizes that students in general, and females in particular, develop depressed attitudes toward physics, and negative perceptions of themselves as physics learners due to the lack of personally meaningful learning experiences. Thus, she submits the following research questions: (1) What high school physics teaching practices predict physics identity development?; (2) How do these strategies influence physics identity development, especially mediated by perceptions of their performance, competence, recognition, and interest?; (3) What is the long-term impact of these experiences on physics identity as students traverse their undergraduate careers?; and (4) What is the most appropriate pedagogical plan for high school physics teachers to ensure adequate development of positive physics identity?<br/><br/>The study's proposed methods consist of case studies, a longitudinal study, development of a pedagogical plan, and the implementation of this plan. Classroom case studies of successful teachers draw on the previously referred survey of which 348 (90 females) finished high school physics with a self-rating as a physics person (5 on a 0-5 scale), including positive perceptions of instructional and leaning experiences. The longitudinal study aims at understanding the long-term impact of specific pedagogical practices on students' physics identity,including 15 students (8 females) who will be tracked over 3 to 4 years through surveys and interviews at the end of each academic year. Development of the pedagogical plan will include 15 sample lesson plans with detailed activities that connect physics content to real-world contexts, counter stereotypes about physics, analysis of underrepresentation in physics, and physics identity formative assessments. The plan will be tested through a quasi-experimental study with four teachers using the same physics course with at least two groups. Each teacher will implement the plan in one of the groups; the other group will be used as control. Of the 180 physics classes, approximately 15 (one every two weeks) will use the education plan. A physics identity scale will be administered at the beginning and end of each course. Classroom observations will be conducted while the plan is implemented."

The cases will be used to introduce the lab concepts as a way to bring relevance to the analytical skills being learned in the lab. The overarching goal for this project is to reform laboratory ""step-by-step"" instruction to a method that will be more active, engaging and relevant to millennial learners. More specifically, the project will evaluate student learning preferences, student engagement, retention of material, and learning of course concepts using the case studies method. Qualitative and quantitative assessment will be conducted to evaluate student perceptions for use of the methods, student learning gains, and critical thinking of students in biology, environmental engineering, and introductory engineering courses. This study will evaluate and compare data based on gender, ethnicity, and institutional type across three very different university environments. This work has the potential for broad impact because there is widespread interest in improving educational practices across STEM fields.

First, numerous empirical efforts have examined the relationship between the location of environmental hazards and socially vulnerable populations. These quantitative studies continue to produce contradictory and contentious findings on environmental equity, due in large part to different definitions of the appropriate scale of analysis. A second group of studies have focused on the development of hazard ranking indices to evaluate and compare the potential risks of chemical releases. These efforts have produced a variety of techniques to develop toxicity weighting algorithms. These current efforts have raised interesting questions, but are limited because: (1) they have not paid proper attention to issues of spatial scale, (2) they have mostly looked at singular hazards and not at risk indices, and (3) they have not properly considered multiple indicators of social vulnerability such as race/ethnicity, age, education, rurality, income, and unemployment. Working with the Risk-Screening Indicator Model in the EPA Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, this project will introduce methodological innovations that bridge these lines of environmental justice research. In particular, the methods will help develop an empirical tool that combines both spatial and hazard screening techniques. The primary hypothesis is that scale issues have a major impact on environmental equity analysis and play a large part in confounding results across different studies. Spatial scale and issues of aggregation have not been the focus of much critical examination in the academic literature on environmental equity. The proposed project will address the following questions. How does change in scale affect the analysis and outcomes of correlation between environmental hazard locations and socioeconomic variables? Are spatial clusters of environmental hazards and community socioeconomic variables evident in metropolitan areas? Can a hierarchy of metropolitan hazards be discerned across the metropolitan riskscape? By combining spatial and hazard screening tools, decision-makers and citizens can begin to determine clusters of varying hazards that may be impacting socially vulnerable populations. These techniques can move analysts towards methods to identify high environmental impact areas for further pollution prevention efforts or more focused risk assessments."

This educational pedagogy promotes the use of cases, or interactive stories, to engage students in STEM courses and to help reform STEM instruction. The cases will be used to introduce the lab concepts as a way to bring relevance to the analytical skills being learned in the lab. The overarching goal for this project is to reform laboratory ""step-by-step"" instruction to a method that will be more active, engaging and relevant to millennial learners. More specifically, the project will evaluate student learning preferences, student engagement, retention of material, and learning of course concepts using the case studies method. Qualitative and quantitative assessment will be conducted to evaluate student perceptions for use of the methods, student learning gains, and critical thinking of students in biology, environmental engineering, and introductory engineering courses. This study will evaluate and compare data based on gender, ethnicity, and institutional type across three very different university environments. This work has the potential for broad impact because there is widespread interest in improving educational practices across STEM fields.

In 1933, following the Great Depression's catastrophic effects and Newfoundland's own impending bankruptcy, representative government in Newfoundland was suspended, as the Dominions Office in London concluded that Newfoundland needed large-scale social, economic, and political reform. In response, a six-man Commission of Government and governor was installed and remained in power until Newfoundland's Confederation with Canada in 1949. This period of Commission rule, although often overlooked, is key to wider debates in Canada over federal-provincial transfers and resource access, as well as broader controversies over Newfoundland's 'culture' and nationalist sentiment. It is also central to Newfoundland's current political, cultural, and economic situation within and beyond Canada. This project will investigate the Commission's role in transforming Newfoundland socially and economically. Through an analysis of Commission archives in Newfoundland and the Dominions Office in London, it will investigate how economic and social restructuring policies in Newfoundland were framed and understood by Commission officials, how such policies were applied and fought over across Newfoundland, and how they were linked to wider theories of development, ethnicity, and empire circulating in this time period. The analysis will focus on places in the archive where contest and protest over the Commission's legitimacy and actions are especially clear, seeking to understand why such challenges to Commission reform efforts were socially and geographically uneven across Newfoundland. In identifying these moments of contest and conflict in the archival record of Newfoundland's Commission government, the project will document and further investigate direct attempts by the Commission and those opposed to them to transform daily material life in Newfoundland.<br/><br/>This research will provide new insight into Newfoundland's 'place' within and beyond Canada. By historically examining questions of economic modernization, cultural identity, sovereignty, and 'development' in Newfoundland, it will advance understandings of how and why the region has been framed as a traditional and backward place. Understanding these historical framings of Newfoundland matters even now, as despite rising standards of living and a greater measure of economic prosperity, Newfoundland continues to be seen as distinct within both a Canadian and North-American context. More broadly, this research will show how particular historical geographies are used to justify and legitimate certain paths of economic success, 'modernity,' and 'development'. The framings of Newfoundland produced during the Commission government and examined in this project endure into the present, with clear political, economic, and policy implications. Thus understanding the period of Commission rule sheds light on contemporary circumstances in this province at the margins of Canada but central to wider colonial and modernizing practices of the early twentieth century. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

The principal investigator proposes to examine the characteristics, motivations, in and out-of-school experiences, informal science activities, and career trajectories of 1000 science hobbyists and ""master hobbyists."" Master hobbyists are individuals who have developed science expertise and spend considerable free time engaging in science as a leisure activity. Master science hobbyists are found across most areas of science (e.g. birdwatchers, amateur astronomers). This research will determine who these individuals are, their career pathways, how they engage in science activities and what motivates, sustains, and defines their science interests. One of the particular goals of this research is to develop new understandings of how science hobby interests develop for women and underserved minorities.<br/><br/>In the proposed research investigators will use the results of interviews and surveys to identify contextual factors that influence the motivational processes that, in turn, influenced choices of careers and contribute to ongoing choices in hobby and citizen science activities. Of interest in this study is how citizen scientists who are also serious hobbyists differ from master science hobbyists. Research on citizen scientists has shown that this group is highly motivated by collective motives (such as a desire to help others and further science), whereas this may not be the case with the master science hobbyist. Two groups will be sampled: a) birdwatchers and b) amateur astronomers. This sampling model will allow investigators to contrast their findings by: 1) those who have selected a science career versus those that did not select a science career, 2) those who participate in citizen science activities and those that do not, and 3) those who are birdwatchers (greater mathematical components) and those who are amateur astronomers (lesser mathematical components). Additional coding and analyses will examine any differences in the evolution of bird watching and astronomy hobbies. The results of this research will be examined in light of existing motivational and sociocultural models of career selection.<br/><br/>This research will document differences in the perceived motivational elements that influenced master science hobbyists/citizen scientists to choose a science career or not. The results can inform federal, state, and local policies for supporting youth and adults engaged in free choice learning. Results of this research will inform the design of intervention/recruitment programs and ISE outreach initiatives. Potential audiences include ISE institutions (e.g. museums and science centers), organizations with links to STEM (e.g. scouts, boys/girls clubs) and pre- and college initiatives that seek to influence career choices and life-long science interests. The proposed cross-disciplinary approach will promote new understandings of complex issues related to motivation, retention, career selection, leisure activities, engagement with formal and informal educational environments, gender and ethnicity, communities of practice and changes in interests over time. Members of the advisory board have expertise in assessment and measurement and will work closely with the project team to conduct a detailed examination of methodologies and analyses at all phases of the project."

In addressing this question, this project contributes to our understanding of political participation, the relationship between religion and collective action, the relationship between ethnicity and public goods, and the debate over the role of ideology and interests in explaining secular political activism. Previous analyses of religion and political participation have not assessed religious institutions' micro-level impacts on laity political participation. By utilizing the insight from the collective action literature that institutions structure individual incentives for producing public goods, this study forms rationalist micro-level hypotheses of religious institutions' effects on political activism. By focusing on the relationship between civil society, participation, and democracy in Mexico, the study will help the academic and policy-making communities better understand fundamental building blocks of democratic governance and stability. <br/><br/>The project's intellectual merit is associated with its examination of the relationship between religious organizations and political participation in a democratic context. The research investigates three forms of political participation and mobilization. Regional variation in political participation across Mexico will be used to uncover the conditions under which religious organizations mobilize political action. The project employs a multi-method research design utilizing: 1) a quantitative analysis of 13,500 data observations collected from the nationally representative National Survey of Political Culture and Citizenship (ENCUP); 2) qualitative field research of nearly 6 months in the Diocese of San Cristbal de las Casas in the Mexican State of Chiapas and the Archdiocese of Yucatn in the State of Yucatn; and 3) an agent based model to pattern-match simulated empirical predictions against empirical data. The main expectation is that where religious institutions devolve decision-making, monitoring, and sanctioning authority to laity, individuals develop capacities to overcome collective action problems related to political activism. <br/><br/>The project also makes important contributions at a broader social level. The global ""third wave of democratization"" involved nations whose citizenry generally score high on levels of individual religiosity, yet whose citizens also generally score low on levels of political engagement. A more precise understanding of how and when organized religion plays a role in political mobilization can help us better gauge the prospects of citizen participation in these countries. Additionally, the use of agent-based modeling is novel in the field of religion and politics. This method uses computers to simulate macro-level outcomes as the result of the interactions of individuals constrained by institutional factors. Finally, the project will incorporate training of native indigenous Spanish-speaking students directly from the field research site in Yucatan to perform content analysis. This will facilitate a cross-cultural exchange of research methods and provide a unique opportunity for underrepresented indigenous students to engage in scholarly research."

To increase the diversity of students entering this field, this program targets those students with limited research experience, first generation college students and under-represented minorities in science due to ethnicity and geographic isolation. The program entails a summer component and a continued effort during the academic year. Ten students will be selected for 10-week research experiences during the summer. The program will begin with a one-week orientation that will introduce the students to the university, research design and analysis, and report writing and presentation. The remaining nine weeks will consist of students working side by side with researchers on their projects. In addition, one day a week will involve lectures and field trips focused on different topics in conservation biology, sessions on statistics, report writing and presentation, and graduate school and career presentations. Students will complete a written research paper and make an oral presentation at the undergraduate research symposium.

Students are provided a personally registered remote control that is used to answer conceptual questions during the actual class. The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept. They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom. Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities. Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction. We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions. Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class. We are varying the types of questions, amounts of response data students see and questioning techniques to determine which combinations provide the richest learning experiences. Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity.

Focus groups will be stratified by religious orientation and social class, and we will recruit participants to achieve diversity on age, gender, and race/ethnicity. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Our main objective is to analyze how Americans respond to topics in which legal, scientific, and religious experts propose different policies, make competing claims on public resources, and receive widespread media coverage for their divergent views. We aim to provide alternative conceptual tools which can potentially affect public discourse so that it takes into account the views of a wide variety of stakeholders among the American public. This may help address recent concerns about how to engage respectfully in public discourse. The scientific value of the project is related to its design, which will let us pinpoint the cultural references that shape how ordinary citizens think and talk about complex issues, and specify the basis for both ?automatic cognition? (the initial or ?blink? reaction) and ?deliberate cognition? (cooler and more rational second-order cognition). Thus, the project will identify sources of social fragmentation, as well as sources of commonality and consensus that shape public discourse."

Processes of this type cover a wide variety of phenomena, including the diffusion of new technologies, the transmission of social norms, and sorting by class, race, or ethnicity. The research extends our theoretical understanding of such processes, and where possible compares predictions of theory with evidence. Three topics are investigated. The first is the relationship between the macroscopic behavior of these processes and the micro-response rules governing individual behavior. The hypothesis is that certain long-run properties, such as the relative likelihood of various equilibrium and disequilibrium patterns, are robust under various specifications of individuals' adaptive behaviors. This would enhance the usefulness of such models in applications where individual response rules are heterogeneous and difficult to estimate statistically. A second topic of theoretical investigation is the inertia of local interaction processes --the expected time it takes the system to reach (or come close to) long-run conditions from an arbitrary initial state. Extending previous work in this area, it will be shown how inertia is related to geometric properties of the social network. Of particular importance is the degree to which agents interact in small, close knit groups instead of large, disparate ones.<br/>The third part of the research tests certain qualitative predictions of these theories against empirical evidence. The primary application is an empirical study of principal-agent contracts agriculture, using an extensive data base covering several thousand farms in Illinois from 1977-1995. The level of detail in these data presents a unique opportunity to test various hypotheses suggested by theory. One hypothesis is that contract terms tend to exhibit a local conformity effect, that is, they cluster around certain values that can be construed as local norms. Once established, these norms shape the expectations of the contracting parties, and thus tend to perpetuate themselves through the force of precedent. This model of norm formation leads to specific predictions about spatial and temporal variations in contract terms that can be tested empirically. A second hypothesis suggested by the theory is that such norms can cause measurable distortions from neoclassical price equilibrium, that is, they create a stickiness in expectations that impedes the equilibration of factor returns. The overall goal of the research is to identify situations where dynamic models of local interaction lead to predictions that differ from those of neoclassical equilibrium models, and to put some of these predictions to the test empirically."

In particular, this research team will study the impact of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and nationality on the response to mass fatalities created by the tsunami. It will also seek to examine the current procedures in place in western countries such as the United States, Canada, France, Sweden and the United Kingdom including the international approach to DVI (disaster victim identification) as developed through an Interpol committee. The team will compare the responses in Asia to those in previous, smaller incidents in western industrialized countries such as the Estonia ferry incident, the Lockerbee crash, and the Oklahoma City bombing, among others. This research will result in a practical outcome such as revisiting of planning procedures for mass death including those developed by Interpol and in a clearer understanding of the response to mass fatalities across cultures focusing upon the transcultural elements that can be applied in the United States. Fourteen researchers from the U.S., Canada, Australia, India and Bangladesh are involved in the project. Two researchers are medical doctors, one is an architect (and dean of an Indian emergency management center), one is a minister, while the others are social scientists. Ten researchers will comprise three field teams (one team to go to Thailand, one to go Sri Lanka, and one to go to India). The other project participants will provide consulting and support. The findings will be shared with the universities of the participants, publishing in journals such as the International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, and shared via a teleconference.

Decades of U.S. dominance in science and engineering research helped create U.S. leadership in emerging industries such as information and biotechnology. But U.S. science and engineering research are likely in coming decades to take their place among many strong players on a global scene. Europe, Japan and Korea are already international powers in research and development, and China, India, Brazil, and South Africa are rapidly expanding their capabilities. <br/>Under these circumstances, the capacity to monitor the world research front and absorb research knowledge from other countries is more important than ever for the United States. Innovation in the U.S. will thrive best in an open information environment in which our ties to the rest of world research and development are strong. Many factors will contribute to the absorptive capacity of U.S. research. International collaboration is certainly one. <br/>This project explores the benefits of international collaboration for U.S. researchers and their collaborators. Several models for international collaboration exist, including informal versus formal and small versus big science. In order to take a close look at the benefits of collaboration under these models, this study focuses on two fields, bio-fuels and materials science. To compare informal with formal models, an examination is done of each area before and after a formal policy intervention in 2007 that encourages international collaboration (in bio-fuels the U.S.-Brazil ethanol agreement and in materials science the start of the user program at the Spallation Neutron Source). In addition, these examples allow examination of both a small science area and a big science project in the periods before and after a formal collaboration program starts. <br/>The research plan draws on literature- and funding-based data, interviews and a survey. The research contributes to the literature on international research collaboration through its rich mix of methods and its empirical focus on results of the collaborations. It also contributes with comparative design. The interview data compares participants in the interventions with other international collaborators in the same research areas and the secondary and survey data provides comparative information on general patterns of collaboration in those research areas, both before and during the intervention. Through before-after, participant-non-participant, North-South, and U.S.-partner comparisons, sources, benefits, costs, and barriers of a variety of dimensions of international research collaboration are identified. Questions such as whether benefits are mutual, whether the inclusion of junior researchers brings cumulative benefits over time, and whether the two types of programs under investigation have different effects are also explored. <br/>The project will contribute to teaching, training, and learning by involving graduate and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech in every stage of the research, giving them hands-on training in three different methods. The student team will be diverse in terms of both gender and ethnicity, and both senior investigators are women. The project strengthens science and innovation policy networks between Georgia Tech and Colombia by following through on dissertation research of a team member. The results will be disseminated broadly with both scholarly and policy audiences, and will contribute to moving global innovation forward more quickly by providing information on models of effective collaboration."

This project uses original survey research to inquire into opinion on policies that influence child welfare, including foster care, childcare, welfare, and parenting policies that are targeted toward low-income mothers. This project will provide new insight into the intersection of racial attitudes and attitudes about welfare policy by interrogating the impact of gendered racial stereotypes, such as the construct of the ""welfare mother."" Last, developing new measures and gathering new public opinion data in a politically important, yet unexplored, area is valuable in itself. <br/><br/>The investigator will survey online a random sample of 400 Americans from the general population, 300 Latino-Americans, and 300 African-Americans. The survey poses questions about real and hypothetical policies concerning child welfare, focusing on prenatal care, child support, and welfare. It also includes an experimental manipulation, in which respondents are primed to imagine a poor recipient of government assistance who is either Black, white, or Latino before they are asked a battery of questions about welfare recipients' behavior. Data analysis will assess, among other things, whether this racial priming impacts survey responses. The investigator hypothesizes that ethnicity and class are indeed central to public perceptions of policies that concern child welfare and parenting. <br/><br/>This project will be relevant to the interdisciplinary group of academics who study child welfare, parenting, racial attitudes, gender, and/or social welfare policy, as well as to political organizations and policymakers involved in politics of these issues. When the survey is completed, the researcher plans to present this research to colleagues at workshops and conferences, to relevant political practitioners, and to people outside academia and politics through community forums and media exposure. In short, this work will engage academics across disciplines, political organizations and politicians, and Americans at-large."

Thus, a powerful way to thwart stereotypes is to act atypically for your group. For example, women who strive to be leaders might simply ""act like men"" (e.g., be self-confident and ambitious) to avoid being judged as weak or incapable. However, people who counteract stereotypes risk being socially rejected. For example, masterful women are judged to be highly competent, but they are disliked for being insufficiently feminine. Similarly, academically gifted minority group members are judged to be highly intelligent, but they risk being disliked for acting ""too White."" Acting atypically can indeed thwart stereotypes, but it can also lead to serious reprisals, including being sabotaged and passed over for a job or promotion. Reprisals for counterstereotypical behavior have been termed backlash effects. Across nine experiments, the present research will investigate the causes and consequences of backlash effects, using a wide range of social groups (based on gender, ethnicity, religion, and politics). The research program will also show that backlash influences perceivers and actors differently, but that both groups play a role in cultural stereotype maintenance. First, perceivers who reject atypical actors (e.g., by failing to hire them) curb atypical actors' ability to stand out as role models, which in turn allows stereotypes to persist, unchallenged. Second, actors who fear backlash tend to hide their atypical behaviors (including counterstereotypical talents) from others. They also engage in other strategies that maintain stereotypes (e.g., increased norm conformity) in order to avoid backlash. In sum, when perceivers punish atypical actors or when actors closet their own atypical behaviors, stereotypes are allowed to thrive in the culture-at-large. To counter this process, the research will examine the effectiveness of an intervention strategy. Because atypical actors are critical for reducing perceivers' use of stereotypes, it is important to develop strategies that might reduce the threat of backlash for atypical actors. Doing so should encourage the visibility of counterstereotypical achievement and thereby afford actors greater opportunity to challenge cultural stereotypes. An increased understanding of the motives underlying backlash should also lead to stereotype reduction by promoting conditions under which stereotyped group members can maximize their potential without fear of reprisals. In concert, the research should inform policies for educational and workplace settings, including how to structure environments so that people can perform to their highest level without the encumbrance of stereotypes, or the need to hide their accomplishments under threat of backlash."

The global economy is in the midst of large-scale transformation driven by innovations in IT and the explosive growth of the Internet. IT is reshaping markets and consumer and enterprise behavior, while at the same time business realities determine which IT innovations are viable. Little is yet known about the economic and social impacts of this transformation. Significant new research is needed on various types of IT-enhanced economic environments, including: markets with asynchronous participation; markets with automated agents; new market formats enabled by IT; and new composite information services. Automated trading agents play an increasing role in the IT-enabled markets, and their interaction with human traders demands close scrutiny.<br/><br/>The methods to be employed in this project include the development of new theoretical models and the testing and refinement of the models in controlled experiments with human subjects. To date, the most detailed scientific knowledge of trader behavior and market performance is confined to classic market formats and to very simple goods. This research will expand that classical knowledge, test its robustness, and open new lines of inquiry by considering a broader range of market formats (one-sided auctions, two-sided markets and new hybrids), a broader range of goods (including new composite IT service products), and a broader range of behavior (including human interaction with automated agents).<br/><br/>The scientific knowledge generated by the research will disseminate swiftly into the community of e-commerce practitioners, and will help provide a sounder basis for integrating IT into the world economy. The platforms for running the various market formats and automated agents will be incorporated into the National Science Digital Library, enhancing infrastructure for teaching and research. Teaching, training and learning will be promoted directly for numerous graduate students who serve as research assistants and programmers; some undergraduates will also help with the programming and hundreds will serve as laboratory subjects who become experienced in market trading and controlling market agents. Given the ethnicity of students at the campuses, and given the history of employment at the labs, a large share of the educational benefits are likely to accrue to women and members of minority groups."

These theories, which suggest that young people commit delinquent acts because they do not consider the long term or broader consequences of their acts, have received significant scientific support. They argue that child rearing practices in the home and the school produce people with varying degrees of concern for family, school, and peers, which translates into a differential likelihood of committing delinquent or criminal acts. Major scientific issues remain, however, which center on the generalizability of such patterns, on the circularity or tautological nature of individual-level control theories, on the relation between social and individual sources of control, and on the relation between control theory and other forms of deterrence (such as activities of the criminal justice system). The research will (1) test the generalizability of earlier work to samples differing in ethnicity, gender, urban location, and historical period; (2) develop and validate measures of self- control; (3) analyze the relationship between social-control and self-control; and (4) explore the relationship between these forms of control and other types of deterrence.

The legitimacy of a nation-state depends upon its efficacy in producing citizens who see their participation in the economy, politics and the community in general, as in their best interests as individuals and as a collective national body. The proposed dissertation takes up the case of Singapore to address these issues. Singapore is a nation-state that is peculiar in several ways: it is not strictly authoritarian but certainly not democratic; it has a seemingly docile citizenry that nonetheless participates actively in the state's numerous economic and social projects; and its orientation toward ""modernity"" does not stop the state from formulating policies encouraging college-educated women to have more babies. One is led to ask the following questions: up close, what does Singapore's rule look like? How is rule organized if it is obviously not a democracy, but also not an authoritarian regime? Under what conditions has this rule been constructed and under what conditions has it been sustained? What does the type of rule actually mean for those being ruled over, and how are they participating in it? By analyzing three sets of institutions--housing, reproduction, and marriage--this project aims to address these questions. The research will be carried out along three lines: (1) a close textual analysis of key social policies, (2) interviews with citizens who negotiate these policies, and (3) by juxtaposing the cases of Singapore and Malaysia. This dissertation aims to deepen and complicate existing understandings of how developing states come to have stable rule and produce citizen subjects who find meaning in their participation in the state's imagery of ""development."" The project's contribution to sociology will be to gain more holistic views of state rule, integrate understandings about what states do in the economic realm with what they do in socio-politico-cultural realms, examine principles of social division such as, gender and ethnicity and the roles they play in ""producing citizens"" who understand and find meaningful their participation in the state's national project of development."

These indicators will measure access to IT in terms of point of access (i.e., work, home, and libraries), demographics (i.e., income, education, race and ethnicity), and technological capability (i.e., computer and modem speed, internet access, software and media). The PI will utilize data from government, commercial, and non-profit sources. These indicators will help in the evaluation of the so-called ""digital divide""--the social and economic disadvantages of lacking access to information in a knowledge-based economy. These indicators are of particular significance to the National Science Board, the Divsion of Science Resources Studies, the broader U. S. policy community, and scholars. The project will aim to synthesize the theory and empirical evidence regarding the impacts of information inequalities on information and society, develop prototype indicators of IT equity in the United States, and evaluate the potential for an IT equity indicators program. The key expected outcomes are a set of prototype IT equity indicators and detailed instructions about the construction of the measures, the data available to calculate the measures, and the institutional and data collection requirements for an on-going effort in this area."

To help students choose career paths in S & E, and persist in the face of inevitable difficulties and disappointments, we need to understand how they conceptualize their futures (Packard & Nguyen, 2003). The concepts and processes involved in this conceptualization make up a person's future time perspective (FTP). The more accurate, complete, and viable a person's FTP, the more likely they are to succeed, both in the present and in the future. By better understanding how students think about their futures in S & E, we can better support and guide them, increasing the number of students who choose and succeed in S & E careers.<br/><br/>This project will develop and validate a model of FTP and apply it to evaluating interventions intended to help students choose and persist in engineering career paths. It has three phases. In Phase I, a model of students' FTP, and, in particular, their future as engineers will be developed and tested. In Phase II, the model will be extended, tracking students from freshman year to senior year in order to explore the relationship between students' FTP, their academic performance, and their motivation to pursue careers in engineering. Because of the longitudinal nature of the project, students who move from engineering into other scientific fields, into science education, or into a non-science-oriented career will also be tracked. Phase III will begin the process of using what has bee learned in the previous phases about the motivational profiles of successful engineering students to evaluate programs already in place to recruit students into engineering. <br/><br/>This research will be conducted at Arizona State University (ASU), a university notable for the diversity of its student body, not only in ethnicity and language, but also socioeconomic status and family educational experience. The diversity of ASU's student body and the large sample that will be tracked will support the extension of findings from this project to other universities. The PI will work with a consortium of universities in the Southwestern United States for dissemination of research results and consultations about interventions at other universities."

Thanks to the National Science Digital Library (NSDL; http://nsdl.org), the opportunity exists to filter millions of resources and customize them for individual learners. This NSDL targeted research project is organizing digital libraries by dimensions that are important to teachers and learners--specifically, cognitive characteristics (cognitive development, spatial and math retrieval skills, reading level), affective characteristics (self-efficacy, motivation, beliefs/attitudes toward the subject), and social characteristics (gender, main language, ethnicity). The investigators hypothesize that customization of resources will result in visitors spending more time in NSDL and students achieving more in-depth learning.<br/><br/>As a testbed, the investigators are creating a customized learning environment, ""Customized MathForum,"" within the Math Forum Digital Library (MFDL; http://mathforum.org), which is one of the most popular instructional digital libraries and has one of the largest communities of users (over a million individuals). The investigators are indexing the digital library according to cognitive, affective, and social dimensions and are evaluating whether such indexing helps stakeholders (teachers, students, and contributors/authors) find effective and efficient material and whether such indexing results in more effective learning than when resources are chosen randomly. Project activities include:<br/><br/>* designing a customized learning environment for middle school and high school teachers and students within MFDL;<br/>* generating a portal to a special library of 750 arithmetic and geometry problems individualized for specific cognitive and behavioral skills;<br/>* developing smart search tools and intelligent agents that will search the digital library for appropriate resources;<br/>* integrating an enhanced metadata system in MFDL along dimensions that are important to teachers and learners--e.g., relation to state educational standards, and cognitive, affective, and social characteristics;<br/>* evaluating the impact of providing customized problems for students and teachers; and<br/>* disseminating tools for customized services to other digital library service providers.<br/><br/>Though described in terms of MFDL, this research is general and the methodology is applicable to many NSDL collections.<br/><br/>This project builds on tools and technologies that have evolved from several NSF-supported projects in three domains: intelligent tutoring systems, digital libraries, and instructional networks. The research directly addresses computational issues (advances in machine agents in distributed environments and the integration of intelligent tutors and digital libraries) and cognitive and affective issues (human learning characteristics and student models that improve online instruction). The research should result in sensitive instruction that is responsive to individual differences, especially among underrepresented minorities and women, and should unveil the extent to which students of different cognitive abilities learn with different forms of teaching."

For the last hundred years Southern California has provided the primary home for the U.S. aerospace industry. Although this geographic concentration had important consequences for both aerospace and Southern California, no systematic archive on the subject currently exists, and much important historical material has been lost. The project will preserve documentary collections and oral histories in an aerospace archive at the Huntington Library. <br/><br/>Southern California aerospace illuminates crucial issues in science and technology studies and in American history. It was a major sector of the U.S. economy in the last century and employed a substantial fraction of American scientists and engineers. Its history highlights disciplinary differences between science and engineering and between design and production engineering, and institutional relationships among universities, government labs, and industrial corporations. Aerospace overlaid on these relations the differences between civilian and military sectors, especially the issue of classification. Finally, the industry's concentration in Southern California underscores the effects of place in science and engineering: how technologies can reflect the particular geographical context that produces them, and in turn how the production of such technologies influences the broader context. The history of Southern California aerospace thus combines history of science and technology with scholarly interests including labor, industrial policy, gender and ethnicity, art and literature, popular culture, and the environment.<br/><br/>This project will provide vital and lasting infrastructure for research, teaching, and outreach. The aerospace archive capitalizes on the institutional collaboration of the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West, combining the curatorial and scholarly resources of the Huntington Library and the University of Southern California. The project includes strong outreach to science writers and science museums, and it supports an ongoing ""Teaching American History"" program for K-12 education at the Huntington Library. A project website will help disseminate the archive's products. The project will thus provide a sorely needed entry point for research into this vital aspect of American history."

The scientific core of the project is the biology of conjugation in the freshwater ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila. Nuclear-cortical interactions initiate meiosis and mediate a cascade of events including nuclear exchange, programmed nuclear degeneration, and the determination of somatic and germinal nuclear fates. While engaged in a broadly targeted program of gene discovery, the PI and his collaborators and students will explore the roles of 3 specific gene products: T-MEC1, which plays a role in meiosis; fenestrin, which has a role in mediating pronuclear exchange and fertilization; and T-VASA, which has a role in the determination of nuclear fates. <br/><br/>PI Eric S. Cole has developed a method of isolating intact nuclear exchange junctions and assaying their abundance with fluorescently tagged lectins. His lab is also competent at creating GFPtagged constructs and genetic knock-outs by manipulating targeted gene expression. The Cole lab is particularly well trained in conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy skills.<br/>Co-PI Robert Rutherford brings bioinformatic resources to the project, allowing the team and their students to search the Tetrahymena genome for genetic homologs. His ""CCT"" program has identified meiosis checkpoint genes homologous to those in yeast and pattern-gene orthologs from Drosophila, among others.<br/>Co-PI Douglas Beussman brings state-of-the-art proteomics to the collaboration. Beussman's laboratory can take proteins from polyacrylamide gels, fragment them, and determine precise molecular weights via mass spectrometry. This data can be used to scan the recently published Tetrahymena genome pulling out corresponding gene sequences for molecular genetic analyses.<br/><br/>Scientific Objectives of the project: The investigators will continue searching the recently published Tetrahymena genome for homologs a/o orthologs to meiotic checkpoint genes, and genes whose products participate in establishing embryonic polarity and pole-plasm determination within metazoan embryos. They have already identified target genes for the project, including Tetrahymena homologs for MEC1 (a gene mediating a meiotic checkpoint in yeast) and VASA (a gene whose product is associated with germ-line determination and polar granule formation in metazoan embryos). They are also isolating and analyzing proteins that form the nuclear exchange junction. These proteins will be used to generate antibodies for western blots and immunofluorescence localization, and to perform Mass Spectrometry in order to identify the corresponding genes for future molecular analysis.<br/><br/>Teaching Objectives of the project: Undergraduate students will enter the proposed ""Gene Stream"" from their faculty mentor's research laboratories or from independent projects launched from academic courses in the biology, chemistry and computer science departments at St. Olaf College. Students will carry a favorite gene sequence or protein from one classroom laboratory to another, effectively creating ""research bridges"" between classes which will provide project continuity and an inter-disciplinary research experience for each student.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Conjugal development in Tetrahymena has much to teach us about how nuclear-cortical interactions govern meiosis, fertilization and determination of nuclear fates. Of particular interest to Dr. Cole and his collaborators is the possibility that the mechanism for distinguishing somatic and germline nuclear fates within metazoan embryos arose initially within unicellular protozoans.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The ""Gene Stream"" program will be inviting and nurturing to students of all backgrounds regardless of gender or ethnicity. Dr. Cole and his collaborators have a long track record of including women and minority undergraduates and providing research students with opportunities for attending state, national and occasionally international meetings. The team has also been included in the Research Links 2010 initiative to share Tetrahymena as a model research system with undergraduate institutions across the nation."

Michael Oakes, and Steven Ruggles<br/>Minnesota Population Center, University of Minnesota<br/><br/>This research will assess the impact of changes in male and female economic opportunity on marriage formation in the United States since 1960. The rise in median age at first marriage over the past four decades is one of the most dramatic and consequential demographic shifts in American history. Initially, most analysts ascribed the change to rising economic opportunity and employment of women. More recently, however, demographic researchers have focused on men, contending that stagnant or declining male economic opportunity in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the unprecedented delay in marriage by reducing the supply of marriageable men. <br/><br/>The central aim of the project is to assess historical changes in the effects of changing male and female opportunity simultaneously. The working hypothesis is that that rising female opportunity discouraged marriage, but that effect diminished over time; after 1970 the decline in the supply of young men with good jobs was the key factor behind late marriage. The analysis will address three key questions: (1) How much of the rise in marriage age may be attributed to shifting economic opportunities of young men and women, rising inequality, and changing spouse availability? (2) Could the differential patterns of change between non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Hispanics be a function of differential socioeconomic conditions? (3) Has the association between economic opportunity and entry into marriage changed over time, especially among women?<br/><br/>This study will capitalize on a vast archive of restricted-access long-form census data currently in preparation by the Census Bureau in collaboration with the Minnesota Population Center. This data series includes the complete long-form census returns for the period from 1960 to 2000. Multi-level analysis will be used to assess the relationship between local economic conditions, measured as wage distributions and labor-force participation, and the marriage decisions of young men and women. The analyses will include separate models by gender, race, and ethnicity.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The unprecedented change in marriage patterns since 1960 has profound implications for American society. The wave of recent state and federal initiatives to promote healthy marriages underscores the relevance of historical perspective. Perceptions about the historical transformation of marriage implicitly or explicitly form the foundation for many of these programs. Empirical understanding of long-run changes in American marriage patterns therefore provides essential background for the formulation of effective public policy. In addition to substantive results, the project will yield important ancillary benefits. The experience of carrying out analysis of the new data series will help us improve the design and documentation of the complete long-form census files. We also plan to write a description of the research process to assist others who are planning studies using the restricted census microdata. This research process template will be posted on the IPUMS website."

The goal of Connecting Youth with Science through Mentored Experiences in Nature is to provide rich STEM activities and research experiences for 600-700 high school students through the existing EnvironMentors (EM) program. EM is a national program supported by NCSE that focuses on preparing underrepresented students for college degree programs and careers in STEM disciplines related to environmental science and the emerging green workforce. To help achieve the goal of scaling-up and organizational capacity building, the number of college and university affiliates will be increased from six to 14 to help reach more students. Additionally, traditional mentoring strategies will be reassessed and improved, cyber-learning activities integrated more fully, and research opportunities increased significantly. Students will engage in credit-earning experiences through a structured independent research element of an existing high school science class about issues related to the environment (e.g. global climate change, measuring public acceptability of alternative energy uses, monitoring water quality upstream and downstream from livestock operation). Students will also participate in field trips, compete for college scholarships, and engage in one-on-one mentoring. Each participating EM chapter will provide 10-15 mentors that will include faculty members, graduates and undergraduates students, working professionals, and retirees. Incentives will be provided for participating high school students and their teachers.<br/><br/>The main research questions are: (1) What combination of the EnvironMentors program components is most effective in engaging youth to environmentally-related STEM programs? How do those combinations differ based on type of institution (e.g., land grant, minority serving) and student demographic (e.g., ethnicity, gender, year in school)? and (2) What combination of the training and development efforts are most effective in building capacity for a university based outreach program that targets underserved audiences? Evaluation will involve qualitative and quantitative methods, measures and modes of analysis including classroom observations; interviews (teachers, students, chapter directors/coordinators, mentors, and partners); focused group sessions; online journaling; and descriptive statistics at each site. Data will be analyzed within and across sites to explore the extent to which any identified differences reveal a pattern that can inform program implementation and scale-up. <br/><br/>A cyber-learning community will be developed to network the EM affiliates and other partners (e.g. Boston University, TamarackMedia, ManuOne, DigitalUniverse, and Encyclopedia of Earth). A direct link to Encyclopedia of Earth will allow students to present what they learned from their projects in the same venues used by some of the world?s leading environmental scientists. Each chapter will be provided toolkits (e.g. digital cameras for capturing photo/video, GPS units for collecting geographic data, and basic digital air and water quality sampling tools) to augment EM?s university affiliates expansive collections of lab and research facilities. Students and mentors will have access to social networking sites from their home base to help develop personal relationships, facilitate connectivity and community-building as part of today?s social norm.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will advance discovery and understanding through a collaborative that will offer rich STEM opportunities for students, investigate how to increase participation of underrepresented students in STEM careers related to environmental science, and study the best combination for accomplishing these tasks. Large land grant universities, minority serving institutions, private colleges, and technical institutions, and schools in rural and urban areas that serve the targeted population are currently onboard. The University of California-Davis, which serves nearly 100% Latino students and Arkansas State University-Jonesboro, which serves nearly 100% African American students, have already agreed to participate in the program. Nationally-recognized college preparation activities on or near participating EM affiliates (e.g. Upward Bound, College Summit, LSAMP, the National College Access Network) are also partner-supporters of the proposed collaborative. These partners will be instrumental in helping to disseminate information learned from this effort. NCSE's participation in Encyclopedia of Earth, will provide students access to a repository of over 4000 authoritative, peer-reviewed articles written by over 1000 science and environmental professionals worldwide (www.EarthPortal/EoE)."

Students are provided a personally registered remote control that is used to answer conceptual questions during the actual class. The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept. They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom. Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities. Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction. We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions. Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class.

Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity. Such documentation is leading to recommendations for how faculty can employ such assessments in the most inclusive way possible."

They gain insight into the teamwork and decision-making inherent in industrial research. They will gain experience in professionally significant skills such as oral and poster presentations, and they attend special weekly seminar meetings which feature presentations by scientists on the frontiers of IT research (speakers are asked to spend some time on how they made their own career choices). Significant efforts will be made to select participants such that the group is balanced in terms of gender, ethnicity and educational background.

These group memberships, or social identities, motivate people's behavior and influence the way they react to others. Important distinctions exist among identities, however. Two ways in which identities differ are: (1) whether an identity is ascribed, such as gender or ethnicity, or achieved, such as an occupation or a parent role; and (2) whether the identity is enacted primarily in the private or in the public domain. Six studies, using a combination of laboratory experiments and structured interviews, will explore the implications of these differences for self-evaluation, group evaluation, and interaction with others. The overall goal is to understand how various forms of identity relate to each other and what characteristics of group membership are important for what forms of social activity."

Bruce, PI<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>How do social institutions respond to increasing diversity? This research examines the question of the accommodation of subcultures in religious institutions via an in-depth, national look at non-territorial parishes in the U.S. Catholic Church. Data are drawn from: (1) a nationwide survey of dioceses regarding the presence and creation of non-territorial or ""personal"" parishes, and (2) follow-up case studies of personal parishes in several dioceses.<br/><br/>In a context of increasing racial, political, and cultural diversification in the U.S., this study brings attention to how the largest U.S. religious denomination has fostered and managed congregations which serve sub-cultural groups. It maps an important concept (the ""personal parish"") which has growing and significant implication for how Americans build and define religion in local contexts. The creation of personal parishes to serve subcultures of Catholics on the basis of ethnicity, language, rite, or other reason reveals how religious groups act within a pluralistic religious marketplace driven increasingly by identity rather than territorial ascription. Findings carry significance not only for religious groups in their attempts to accommodate diversity from within but also for a broader understanding of homophily and heterogeneity in American life as revealed in a variety of social institutions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This project brings empirical data to bear on questions relevant to all social institutions facing subcultural diversification. Its relevance to the ways social institutions accommodate diversity and organize amidst changing local contexts can be utilized by scholars and policy makers.<br/><br/>Its broader impacts also include (1) training for undergraduate students at an Appalachian, non-PhD granting college (including multilingual and first-generation college students) in the methodology of the social sciences, (2) presentation to broad audiences interested in the theoretical and cultural implications of responses to subcultural diversity in American religion and other social institutions, and (3) public access to previously ungathered information on congregations geared toward traditionally marginalized populations. A resulting database of personal parish profiles will facilitate future studies of diversification in the American religious landscape."

Students are provided a personally registered remote control that is used to answer conceptual questions during the actual class. The questions are text-, diagram- or graph-based multiple choice questions that focus on one key concept. They are intended to reinforce material presented in class. They provide immediate feedback to students as class responses are collected in near-real time and displayed on a graph at the front of the classroom. Students and instructors analyze the graphs, discuss the results and use that information to guide subsequent activities. Small group discussion of class responses is the primary mode of instruction. We are analyzing over 9000 student responses to identify questions that can be used as reliable in-class assessments at other institutions. Teaching and learning aids are also being developed to help students identify ways to better prepare for class so that they are successful in and out of class. We are varying the types of questions, amounts of response data students see and questioning techniques to determine which combinations provide the richest learning experiences. Data are being collected in six different states at community colleges, four-year colleges and research universities. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes analyses of data regarding the utility of using electronic response system and questions across populations, disciplines and educational settings and identification of better ways to ensure a scientifically literate population of non-science majors. The broader impact of this proposal includes the thorough study and documentation of student response to these questions by gender and ethnicity. Such documentation is leading to recommendations for how faculty can employ such assessments in the most inclusive way possible."

This award is building on 5-year pilots of 1 and 2. Data from the piloted learning communities indicates that this intervention has very high potential for improving retention and graduation of undergraduate students. Hence, learning communities are the main thrust of this STEP project. They are being expanded to include 80 percent of incoming first-year undergraduates in the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, thereby doubling participation from 500 to 1,000 students. The second intervention dimension is focused on expanding another successful pilot program to transform traditional introductory laboratories to discovery-based research laboratories. A third intervention component is a new one, focused on guiding STEM majors in their second year of study into exploring possible STEM careers, with active participation by peer, alumni, and professional STEM mentors. Overall, the goal of this STEP project is to improve graduation rates of STEM majors from 24% to more than 50% in 5 years.<br/><br/>The University of California Riverside is the most ethnically-diverse campus in the University of California system, and is consistently ranked in the top ten most diverse Tier 1 research universities in the United States according to the 2011 edition of US News and World Report on Colleges.

These three variables -- behavior, personality, and situation -- form a ""triad"" in the sense that if any two were completely understood, the third should in principle be derivable. Psychology includes many tools for conceptualizing and measuring aspects of persons, including numerous personality inventories. In addition, many techniques are available for the assessment of behavior. The purpose of the present project is to develop a means to conceptualize and measure the third element of the triad, the situation. <br/>The new Riverside Situational Q-sort (RSQ) aims at specific and psychologically meaningful properties that evoke widespread agreement but still have different implications for individuals. Two studies will assess situational variables at the general level (Study I) and at the level of individual perceptions (Study II). In Study I participants will provide open-ended descriptions of situations they have experienced within the past 36 hours, as well as their behavioral and emotional responses. Addressing each of the elements of the personality triad, analyses will assess: (1) correlations between individual differences in persons and the average situations they experience, combined with the behaviors they perform in them, (2) correlations between specific behaviors and attributes of the people who perform them, combined with the situations in which they tend to appear, and (3) correlations between properties of situations and the personality attributes of the people who tend to experience them, combined with the behaviors that result. In Study II, participants will describe specific exemplars of situations from Study I using the RSQ. These individual descriptions will be compared with the average view of each situation, provided by all of the participants, and the divergence will be correlated with measures of personality and personality disorders to illuminate how situations may be distinctively construed according to personality. <br/> This research seeks to specify how personality is expressed through the experience of and response to situations. Potential long-term implications include the design of therapeutic interventions based on situational construals of individuals with personality disorders, the matching of people to environments for the promotion of behavioral outcomes (e.g., health, education, and employment), and the design of contexts to promote mental and physical health and the accomplishment of individual goals. In addition, UC Riverside is a designated minority-serving institution (MSI). This provides opportunities to conduct this research within a diverse sample of participants, to explore moderation of effects by ethnicity as well as gender, and to include members of groups underrepresented in science as research assistants who serve essential roles in the laboratory."

Lamanai is notable for having produced the first fruitful information on Maya/Spanish interaction in the southern Maya lowlands. In the Late Postclassic period the community was a small, but flourishing political and economic polity in the central Maya lowlands. Circa 1546, Lamanai was incorporated into the Spanish colonial encomienda system, which required individual households to pay specified amounts of traditional and non-traditional goods. Wiewall's excavations focused on recovery of multiple lines of data that will assess the extent to which household organization, production, and consumption strategies and their corresponding gender relations of production shifted between the Late Postclassic (A.D. 1450-1546) and Spanish Colonial Periods (A.D. 1546-1650). (132).<br/><br/>To understand how the impact of Spanish state formation altered Maya commoner households one can reconstruct household socio-economic activities through application of the house lot model. The house lot is composed of the dwelling, associated buildings and the immediate surrounding area where household activities were carried out and were traces of material and organic by-products of those activities remain. As a household under goes change, specific behaviors or activities may be abandoned or initiated, or the proportions of different activities may change relative to others. Documenting changes in house lot configurations and activities (food preparation, craftwork, gardening, etc.) across space will contribute to understanding the range of activities in which people participated and the decisions they made about labor and resource allocations. Likewise, through comparing individual household groups we gain insight into social organization (gender, age, class, ethnicity) and economic and political organization. (143)<br/><br/>This project examines four house lots and compares the activities performed within this space. A set of archaeological correlates were developed to distinguish a Late Postclassic from a Colonial house lot and thereby the extent of changes in household organization, production, and consumption strategies. Because many productive activities that differentiate households socio-economically from one another take place in areas adjacent to the dwelling this project was geared toward recovery and analysis of non-observable remains accessible through soil chemistry (phosphate) and paleoethnobotanical samples. (82)<br/><br/>This project will have a broader impact by enhancing the level of public understanding of science both in Belize and the United States. Public outreach associated with the project has focused on the community of Indian Church, located adjacent to Lamanai. The Co-PI has implemented a program for local women to receive training and skills as archaeological laboratory assistants. This training will prepare them for future employment with other archaeologists and other researchers conducting investigations in the area. These new skills will open up opportunities for employment with the Belize Institute of Archaeology. Outreach also includes tours of the site and laboratory facilities for the local community and submission of field reports to the community library. The research findings will be disseminated through class lecture, local archaeology interest groups, professional meetings, and scholarly publications. Furthermore, the award will assist in graduate student training."

Promoter escape, which constitutes the initiation-elongation transition, is a key step in regulating productive gene expression. Failure of RNA polymerase to negotiate this transition results in the repetitive synthesis of abortive RNA, a process known as abortive initiation. The extent of abortive initiation vs. promoter escape differs from promoter to promoter and is guided by the initial transcribed sequence (ITS) at each promoter. While previous research has led to the description of a general outline of the promoter escape process, current research will be directed at achieving a detailed mechanism of promoter escape. This goal will require investigation into the sequence-specific nature of promoter escape to understand how an ITS directs a unique abortive initiation-promoter escape program at individual promoters, and controls productive expression by governing the rate of escape and the extent of RNA polymerase partitioning. The proof of a promoter escape mechanism will also require structural characterization of initial transcribing complexes poised on the brink of escape. The methods to be employed in this research will include quantitative in vitro transcription analysis of wild type and mutant promoter templates, kinetic determination of rate and equilibrium constants to understand better the partitioning of transcribing complexes into productive or unproductive conformation, and footprinting techniques to characterize the static or dynamic structure of transcribing complexes. The combined approaches will shed light on how the ITS sequence directs RNA polymerase to relinquish its promoter contacts at specific positions and bring about the escape transition at a defined rate. All of the knowledge gained from studying E. coli RNA polymerase will be of relevance to understanding the promoter escape strategies by T7 RNA polymerase and eukaryotic Pol II. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Being affiliated with a women's college, the principal investigator routinely works with many undergraduate students in the research and teaching laboratories.

The goal of Connecting Youth with Science through Mentored Experiences in Nature is to provide rich STEM activities and research experiences for 600-700 high school students through the existing EnvironMentors (EM) program. EM is a national program supported by NCSE that focuses on preparing underrepresented students for college degree programs and careers in STEM disciplines related to environmental science and the emerging green workforce. To help achieve the goal of scaling-up and organizational capacity building, the number of college and university affiliates will be increased from six to 14 to help reach more students. Additionally, traditional mentoring strategies will be reassessed and improved, cyber-learning activities integrated more fully, and research opportunities increased significantly. Students will engage in credit-earning experiences through a structured independent research element of an existing high school science class about issues related to the environment (e.g. global climate change, measuring public acceptability of alternative energy uses, monitoring water quality upstream and downstream from livestock operation). Students will also participate in field trips, compete for college scholarships, and engage in one-on-one mentoring. Each participating EM chapter will provide 10-15 mentors that will include faculty members, graduates and undergraduates students, working professionals, and retirees. Incentives will be provided for participating high school students and their teachers.<br/><br/>The main research questions are: (1) What combination of the EnvironMentors program components is most effective in engaging youth to environmentally-related STEM programs? How do those combinations differ based on type of institution (e.g., land grant, minority serving) and student demographic (e.g., ethnicity, gender, year in school)? and (2) What combination of the training and development efforts are most effective in building capacity for a university based outreach program that targets underserved audiences? Evaluation will involve qualitative and quantitative methods, measures and modes of analysis including classroom observations; interviews (teachers, students, chapter directors/coordinators, mentors, and partners); focused group sessions; online journaling; and descriptive statistics at each site. Data will be analyzed within and across sites to explore the extent to which any identified differences reveal a pattern that can inform program implementation and scale-up. <br/><br/>A cyber-learning community will be developed to network the EM affiliates and other partners (e.g. Boston University, TamarackMedia, ManuOne, DigitalUniverse, and Encyclopedia of Earth). A direct link to Encyclopedia of Earth will allow students to present what they learned from their projects in the same venues used by some of the world?s leading environmental scientists. Each chapter will be provided toolkits (e.g. digital cameras for capturing photo/video, GPS units for collecting geographic data, and basic digital air and water quality sampling tools) to augment EM?s university affiliates expansive collections of lab and research facilities. Students and mentors will have access to social networking sites from their home base to help develop personal relationships, facilitate connectivity and community-building as part of today?s social norm.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will advance discovery and understanding through a collaborative that will offer rich STEM opportunities for students, investigate how to increase participation of underrepresented students in STEM careers related to environmental science, and study the best combination for accomplishing these tasks. Large land grant universities, minority serving institutions, private colleges, and technical institutions, and schools in rural and urban areas that serve the targeted population are currently onboard. The University of California-Davis, which serves nearly 100% Latino students and Arkansas State University-Jonesboro, which serves nearly 100% African American students, have already agreed to participate in the program. Nationally-recognized college preparation activities on or near participating EM affiliates (e.g. Upward Bound, College Summit, LSAMP, the National College Access Network) are also partner-supporters of the proposed collaborative. These partners will be instrumental in helping to disseminate information learned from this effort. NCSE's participation in Encyclopedia of Earth, will provide students access to a repository of over 4000 authoritative, peer-reviewed articles written by over 1000 science and environmental professionals worldwide (www.EarthPortal/EoE)."

Anne Pyburn, Dru McGill will analyze data collected from ceramic ceramics previously excavated from the Mississippian-era archaeological site of Angel Mounds. Angel Mounds State Historic Site, located on the Ohio River in southwest Indiana, is a civic-ceremonial center dating between A.D. 1000-1450, which includes large platform mounds and hundreds of structures surrounded by a fortification wall. Recent research has suggested the existence of ""neighborhoods"" at Angel Mounds, organized by kinship relationships. During Works Progress Administration-era, and subsequent Indiana University field-programs, archaeologists removed over two million artifacts from Angel Mounds, many of which have been minimally studied. McGill will focus his analysis on approximately 4,000 ceramic sherds to help understand the functions of residential groups and the organization of craft production at Angel Mounds and other Mississippian archaeological sites. The research is significant because it will shed new light on America's past. It will also help scientists to understand the basic processes which led to the development and maintenance of complex societies.<br/><br/>Research on craft production and social organization provides insight into cultural features which are thought to influence a number of other theories and practices in archaeology, including: subsistence, ethnicity, ideology, identity, political economy, socio-political complexity, and kin and gender relations. A majority of previous research on craft production has focused on highly decorated ""prestige-goods,"" which, while likely important to the political and economic strategies of Mississippian elites, constitute a small percentage of pottery found at Mississippian sites (approximately 1% at Angel Mounds). This study complements earlier work by focusing on plain utilitarian pottery likely made in domestic contexts. Utilitarian pottery will be analyzed by measuring various aspects of the ""recipes"" and formation techniques used by potters to process clay and shape pottery vessels, with the goal of determining if signatures exist for different pottery-making neighborhoods, or if pottery was made according to other standards (e.g. technological efficiency). By examining differences in pottery production techniques between neighborhoods or kin groups in Angel Mounds, this study has the potential to demonstrate intra-site diversity at Mississippian sites and support the idea that ""commoners"" were active agents in the creation of diverse Mississippian identities. Additionally, this research may contribute to our understanding of the extent of elite control over craft production, and the roles of women in households and kin groups in prehistoric societies.<br/><br/>The project will also have broader impacts for public audiences. McGill will utilize his public education contacts at elementary and secondary schools, libraries, and state parks in Indiana (developed over five years of archaeology outreach experiences) to offer public lectures, classroom visits, and informative pamphlets and posters. Through these media, McGill will increase public knowledge about archaeology, the lives of prehistoric peoples, and science generally. Project data and conclusions will also be disseminated to the scientific community through publications and presentations at professional conferences. Finally, the broader impacts of this project include graduate student training for the author, and undergraduate student training for project research assistants, who will gain insight into collection management practices, ceramic analysis, and archaeology education."

It is a two-day conference on the Binghamton University campus. Participants will include graduate students at all levels, postdocs, and professors. Approximately 160 participants are expected, with about 110 of them traveling from outside of a 1 hour radius from Binghamton. The aim of the conference is to provide a comfortable environment for graduate students from a diversity of backgrounds and schools to share their research. Graduate students will have the priority for talk space. In addition, Gilbert Baumslag from the City University of New York and Robert Ghrist from the University of Pennsylvania will serve as keynote speakers at the conference. Participation from all areas of topology and algebra is encouraged.<br/><br/>The conference strives to strengthen the sense of academic community among mathematics graduate students. Besides giving exposure to the research of advanced graduate students, the conference is an invaluable opportunity for students who have not chosen a research area yet to explore what topics are currently being fruitfully studied. The faculty members who attend serve an essential role in both providing new ideas as well as probing the ideas of graduate students, suggesting ideas for future study, and encouraging students to meet and work with people interested in their areas of research. Graduate students who attend the BUGCAT are better equipped to find academic positions and continue research and collaboration. The conference also promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences, both by encouraging women and minorities to attend and by encouraging participation from a broad range of graduate programs. The conference organizing committee, all graduate students, is remarkably diverse in gender, ethnicity, and background, and hence is well positioned to encourage participation by women and minorities."

She will analyze large series of ceramics recovered from two archaeological sites, Hummingbird Pueblo and Pottery Mound located in the lower Rio Puerco drainage of New Mexico. These large multi-room sites are typical of the late prehistoric period of the region and date to approximately 1150 to 1400 AD. Within the Southwest the centuries immediately before Spanish contact are characterized by population movements from multiple widely dispersed small sites into a more limited number of larger entities. This of necessity required the development of social mechanisms which integrated previously distinct social groups. In addition to such local aggregation, long distance migration which characterized early historic Southwest groups also occurred in prehistoric times and evidence indicates that people from well outside the local region also lived at both the Hummingbird Pueblo and Pottery Mound sites. Ms Eckert wishes to understand how integrating mechanisms developed, the extent to which distinctive social identities were retained and the degree and nature of ties beyond the local Rio Puerco region. She will also examine how these factors changed over time<br/><br/>To address these questions, she will focus on the large well controlled ceramic material excavated at both sites. Because they reflect different aspects of social interaction she will: 1. analyze pottery designs and overt stylistic attributes; 2. examine the technology, such as paste manipulation, by which pottery is produced; 3. use petrographic analysis to identify and determine source location of raw materials to determine whether specific pottery types were imported or locally made; 4. reconstruct vessel size to provide insight into function. Ms Eckert has developed a model which, through the interplay of these variables, will allow her to examine such issues as retained ethnicity and trade and the potential importance of ritual feasting.<br/><br/>This research is important for several reasons. It will increase understanding of the complex interactions which characterize social group formation and how these develop over time. It will provide important data of interest to many archaeologists about a relatively poorly known region of the Southwest and will also contribute to training a promising young scientist."

His focus is on the Epipaleolithic period (from ca. 18,000 to 5,000 years ago) in the Near East and he will study stone tools from a number of sites in this region. He will conduct a number of technological analyses, note differences among sites and attempt to relate these to a series of variables such as the availability of raw material, the nature of the local environment and prehistoric peoples' use of the environment. Because they are so common and well preserved, stone tools provide an important source of archaeological data. For over a century prehistorians have examined such materials to gain insight into the culture of the makers. Traditionally, variation in assemblages between sites has been ascribed to factors such as ""ethnicity"" or function. In recent years archaeologists have recognized that other factors such as mobility strategy can affect assemblage variation. This realization is resulting in the development of analytic approaches which may provide new insight into prehistoric life. Mr. Neeley's work follows in, and expands on this tradition. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will assist in the development of new analytic techniques of potentially wide applicability and will assist in the training of a promising young scientist. ***"

Most of the collections to be analyzed were excavated 50 to 100 years ago, yet very little is known about how or when Puebloan pointed-toed sandals were made. General belief is that these artifacts were in use from approximately A.D. 700 - 1100, were made by all northern Puebloan groups, and had a distinctive four warp construction method. However, very little empirical proof backs these claims, and in some cases directly contradicts the conventional wisdom. <br/><br/>An understanding of the basic temporal and geographic nature of an artifact is essential before it can be used to investigate human behavior. This project will provide this basic understanding for pointed-toed Puebloan sandals by examining multiple specimens through physical and radiographic analysis as well as radiocarbon dating. The physical analysis will focus on basic measurements, raw materials, and construction styles. The radiographic analysis will utilize soft-X ray radiography (for the first time in a major archaeological research program) to inspect the hidden internal construction characteristics of sandals. Ten to fifteen sandals will also be radiocarbon dated. When combined, these data will inform archaeologists how, when, and where Puebloan pointed-toed sandals were made and used. The final, and most important aspect of this research, will then be using this information to identify particular styles in footwear that may indicate prehistoric cultural boundaries. Whether such boundaries exist, the degree of permeability of the boundaries, and if they changed through time, can increase our knowledge of how prehistoric people viewed ethnicity and identity.<br/><br/>This project, while greatly benefiting archaeologists, will also provide essential information and assistance to numerous museums and the public at large. Most museums have no descriptive or technical information on the sandal assemblages they hold. To help remedy this situation, upon completion, all participating museums will receive the results of the individual analysis of artifacts from their collections. Help will also be offered to assist the museums in the creation of displays that exhibit prehistoric Puebloan sandals; helping to inform the public on these amazing pieces of prehistory. This project will also be the first to use soft X-ray radiography in a major archaeological research program. This method permits artifacts that are not very dense, such as perishables, to be X-rayed and still produce readable images of high quality. In essence, it allows a researcher to 'see inside' an artifact of low density, revealing construction details that would otherwise be hidden. Soft radiography is extremely useful because of its applicability to perishables, non-destructive nature, and low cost. This project will pioneer the utility of this technique, its methodology, and its usefulness in perishable research."

Archaeologists identify Peru as one of the hearths of civilization and although the Inca, because they were observed and conquered by the Spanish, are the best known example from this region, they were the last in a succession of complex Andean societies. The Moche first appear as a recognizable group ca. 2,000 years ago on the arid northern coast of Peru and archaeologists can trace their development into a complex urban society over the span of almost 1,000 years. The Moche peoples were associated with the construction of pyramids and other monumental architecture and developed a highly centralized form of government. The origins of Moche civilization however are poorly understood and this process forms the basis for Mr. Attarian's research. Prior work both by Mr. Attarian and other investigators indicates that in immediate pre-Moche times small groups lived in defensible positions on the edge of the Moche Valley. Their subsequent aggregation on the valley floor itself marks the start of the Moche tradition. The particular question which Mr. Attarian wishes to answer concerns the mechanisms which developed to integrate previously independent groups into a single cohesive urban unit. To address this question he will study ceramics and other remains from 6 pre-Moche villages and then compare these with materials recovered from Mocollope, an early Moche center. His preliminary work has shown that while ceramics styles from each of the precursor villages are similar and constitute part of a single tradition, individual villages had specific design elements which made their pottery unique. Mr. Attarian will conduct additional excavation at each of these villages to define individual styles more precisely. He will then collect surface ceramics from Mocollope and excavate in selected areas. With these data he should be able to determine whether these styles continue at Mocollope and are spatially segregated within the site - an indication of ""barrios"" and continued multi-ethnic groups - or whether they are replaced by a pan-city style. Through the use of ceramics and other material remains he will also examine the rise of social/wealth differentiation and how this interacts with ethnicity.<br/><br/>This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase understanding of the rise of complex societies and assist in training a promising young scientist."

The Archaeology Program provides relatively modest high risk exploratory research grants and the project is funded under this competition. In a preliminary reconnaissance, Dr. Marean and his colleagues noted that the four sites under consideration all contain intact deposit. In most, artifacts dating to the Middle Stone Age (MSA) period are either visible in exposed sections or have been discovered on the ground surface in the immediate region. Thus there is good reason to expect, although it is far from certain, that in situ materials are present. Dr. Marean and his colleagues will produce detailed surface maps for each of the rock shelters and then conduct test excavations. The lithic, faunal and shell material recovered will be analyzed after the completion of fieldwork and on the basis of the results it will then be possible to design a full research program.<br/><br/>The long term goal of this work is to understand the cultural transition from ""archaic"" to ""modern"" human behavior. While hominids a quarter of a million years ago could fashion well crafted symmetrical stone tools they lacked many of the traits such as art, religion, ethnicity and long distance trade which characterize all modern people. By 40,000 years ago these are evident in the archaeological record and it is clear that our ancestors from this latter period had modern human capabilities. Dr. Marean and many other researchers wish to understand the process which underlies this transition. Archaeological evidence indicates that this change first took place in Africa during the MSA and several sites along the South African coast provide early and tentative indications of new behaviors. However the information to date is severely limited and solid chronologies are yet to be established. The Mossel Bay sites assume importance in this context both because of their location and because of preliminary evidence that they contain datable materials. Dr. Marean's research will determine which of the sites contains the most abundant, best preserved and longest sequence and with this information it will be possible to design a long term research project."

Tombos was occupied during a period of social transition in which the foundations of the Napatan Kingdom were laid. While some researchers suggest that Egyptianized native bureaucrats provided the basis for the rise of this powerful state during the New Kingdom, others instead argue that Egyptian colonial administrators occupied the top echelon of Nubian government, co-opting local leaders. Recently excavated materials as well as museum collections will be used to address longstanding unresolved questions concerning the identities of these people. Understanding the processes that operate in situations of cross-cultural contact is not only a central goal of anthropological research but also one of great practical significance. Answering questions related to the nature of the interaction between the Nubian and Egyptian polities is of anthropological importance because of its potential to shed new light on larger theoretical issues concerning imperial strategies, cultural contact, and regional interaction patterns. Because of its unique historical context, the skeletal sample from Tombos has great potential as a source of information on the socio-political process of state formation and expansion. As a result, the proposed research will significantly increase our understanding of the processes operating in culture contact situations. <br/>New methods and research materials will be used to resolve longstanding questions about the biological and cultural identities of Nubian New Kingdom colonial administrators and determine the health consequences this period of socio-economic transition had for the local population. Most of the documents dating to this period are concerned with esoteric religious issues and the social elite. Although many royal burials in Nubia and in Egypt have been studied, little paleopathological research on lower status New Kingdom burials have been published. The Tombos burials thus provide a unique opportunity to learn about the population affinities, health status, and living conditions of an important, yet little studied population.<br/>The broader impacts of this research include its contributions to (1) graduate training and education, (b) fostering the development of international scientific cooperation, and (c) conservation of Nubian culture. The region of the Nile where Tombos is located is not well known archaeologically. The rapid expansion of settlement and cultivation threatens sites in this area, and makes their documentation imperative. Because of a lack of funding and staff at the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums in Sudan, sites are left unprotected and uninvestigated. This study will assist the people of Sudan in documenting the rapidly disappearing archaeological evidence of ancient Nubian life and culture."

She will conduct archaeological excavations and continue mapping at the site of Cerro la Cruz on the north coast of Peru. Ms. Vogel's research will examine the relationship between architecture and sociopolitical change, through a diachronic analysis of the expansion and modification of Cerro La Cruz, a hillside walled settlement on the north coast of Peru. Supplementary data such as ceramics will provide indicators of cultural affiliation, while botanical remains and soil samples will be analyzed for indications of dietary or environmental changes. These various lines of evidence will be combined to reconstruct the events which occurred at Cerro La Cruz. For the archaeology of the Andes, this project will provide a method for testing and revising current models of sociopolitical organization during the late Middle Horizon (AD600-1000), a time of great social and political change in the region.<br/><br/>These periods of cultural transition are important for understanding the development of human societies. From a historic or prehistoric perspective, archaeology can explore the ways in which people have adapted to fluctuating social and political conditions. The built environment is an essential focus of anthropological research, especially for understanding architecture and the use of space as it reflects and shapes social life. Changes in architectural form and style are often taken as indices of societal change. Some styles of household architecture have been shown ethnographically to reference ethnicity or other aspects of community identity, while the enlargement of public buildings or temples may mark the accession of a new ruler. In this project, the relationship between architectural change and social life can be investigated at one site, during a period that is thought to involve widespread social and political upheaval. Rather than the traditional ""top-down"" approach of examining political relations from the perspective of those in power, this study will emphasize the perspective of local people in their interactions with an outside political entity. A thorough spatial analysis of the expansion and modification of Cerro La Cruz as a possible manifestation of sociopolitical change will provide a critical test of earlier models of Andean political organization. From the perspective of the social sciences, the results of this case study will contribute to our understanding of the catalysts for culture change and how local people adapt during periods of transition. Ms. Vogel's research will increase our knowledge of a poorly understood period in Peruvian prehistory and will also contribute to the training of a promising young scientist."

Archaeological investigation will entail four weeks of excavation at each site as well as examination of the artifacts that prior survey crews have systematically collected from the surface. The two homesteads will be mapped in detail with special attention paid to placement, orientation, spatial layout and construction of buildings and outbuildings and location of debris. To help determine land use, flotation samples and pollen cores will be collected. The results of the excavation of the homesteads, when combined with collections of oral histories, journals and other primary documentary sources will supply key information on the material culture and life at the household level. This research has two underlying goals. The first is to examine the role of ethnicity in adaptation. Groups from different cultural backgrounds moved to this rural region of Colorado to farm and herd livestock. Anthropologists and historians have speculated on similarities and differences in adaptation which occurred and related these both to different forms of social organization and distance travelled from point of origin. Some have argued that the single set of environmental conditions led to cultural convergence while others have postulated that distinct subcultures were maintained. MS Church will attempt to determine which view is correct. The second goal is a methodological one. Because written documentation exists for both sites, a good deal of a priori control is possible. Ms. Church wishes to examine the material remains which she collects and determine the extent to which they reflect ethnicit y. The methodology she develops and conclusions she draws will be uqeful in a number of archaeological situations. This work is important for several reasons.

This emphasis has often been adopted at the expense of a smaller scale, more intimate understanding of the lives and experiences of the individual peoples comprising those cultures. A consideration of how ancient peoples perceived and identified themselves with respect to those within and without their communities will provide an important step in improving our anthropological understanding of personal and group identity in both the past and present. This research project addresses issues of co mmunity identity and its material expression on range of scales among the Late Classic (650-900 A.D.) peoples of Las Canoas, NW Honduras. Research includes the intensive excavation of both elite and non-elite houses and administrative/ritual buildings at the archaeological site of Las Canoas, as well as analysis of artifacts recovered from those structures. This information will be studied with the aim of finding patterns in the use of built spaces and the production, trade, and use of material goods, such as pottery. The design of human settlements and the changes wrought on them over time lends insight into the ways people feel their environment should be organized and communities experienced. The types of possessions made, gathered, saved, displayed, hidden, and/or discarded by individuals and families reveals much about what they value, what they are able to acquire and to what lengths they will go to access such items. Studies of both ancient architecture and artifact assemblages including pottery, stone tools, domestic refuse, burials, special caches and/or ritual deposits provide a view into how a group of people shaped, lived in, and gave meaning to their world - in essence created their identities. The proposed research will consider the layout, orientation and relationships of buildings to one another, as well as the types and styles of artifacts (especially pottery), as indicators or expressions of individual and community identity. Information recovered from Las Canoas will be analyzed with these ideas in mind and then compared to that known from contemporaneous, similarly sized sites in the surrounding area. Understanding how the peoples living at Las Canoas related to the social, political, and economic hierarchy in Late Classic Mesoamerica are basic goals of this project. The broader aim of the research, however, is to test the hypothesis that much-debated anthropological concepts such as culture and ethnicity do not always play themselves out in the daily reality of human lives. Rather, it is proposed that peoples craft their identities to suit a variety of material and symbolic needs, shifting their alliances and affiliations in response to changing pressures and situations. This research is designed to question our often-untested assumptions about the nature of interaction between different peoples and communities in achieve a better understanding of human behavior."

In Western Europe these new groups are clearly intrusive and the question is where did this transition from `Middle Paleolithic` to `Upper Paleolithic` take place. If one can solve the less interesting `when` and `where` issues it is then possible to address the central questions which involve process. Relatively little is known about the most likely time period in Eastern Europe and the researcher has located two potentially relevant sites.

The project is to study the role of popular music in defining the self-identity of young people in Trinidad. Calypso music has always played a central role in expressing popular social concerns in the country's history, from independence through its current position as an underdeveloped node in a transnational flow of people and resources. Using ethnographic techniques of participant observation and intensive interviewing, as well as drawing upon the results of a random survey of 850 households in Trinidad and extensive demographic data on music listenership by location, age, gender, socio-economic status and ethnicity, the student will document what music means to the `oil boom` (1970s to early 1980s) generation of young adults. The project will investigate the variation according to race, class and gender in how people listen to and participate in popular music. The project will analyze changes in the musical styles (some seen as more `escapist`, others as more `political` or `roots oriented`), audience reactions, and the general social and cultural antecedents to musical production. This project is important because is will advance our understanding of how locally produced music draws on a global set of sources to become meaningful to diverse communities. Given the enormous growth in importance of popular music as a source of identity for young people in the contemporary world, this case study will produce a valuable advance in our knowledge about the meaning of music for young people. In addition this project will add to our society's expertise about this important region of the world."

He is also interested in the question of whether, during the journey from adolescent talent to adult achievement, gifted women and minorities more likely than men and majorities to opt out of math and science careers? If this is so, Dr. Feist is examining some of the psychological influences on these differential rates of attrition. <br/><br/>This project explores these issues from the perspective of the psychology of science. This is a pilot project that will explore and test the basic methodology and the primary survey questions. Specifically, Dr. Feist intends to examine issues related to scientific potential and the scientific achievement. First, a sample of 160 (40 each from 1995, 1985, 1975, and 1965) past winners of the prestigious Westinghouse Science Fair are assessed on outcome measures, namely degrees obtained, career paths chosen (especially science v. non-science) and level of eminence obtained within their careers. Moreover, gender and ethnicity are examined in relation to such outcomes. Second, 100 members of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) are compared with 100 matched non-NAS scientists to determine what the early career markers of world-class scientific achievement are. Outcome measures consist of career eminence (titles, honors, awards) and predictor measures include gender, productivity (publication and citation rates over the entire lifespan) data as well as early indicators of scientific talent. Early indicators include school performance, age of first publication, as well the age that they and others recognized their talent for science. Regression analyses determine the relative importance of each ""predictor"" variable in influencing scientific achievement and eminence. The goal of such research is to provide answers to the question: Who develops interest in, and talent for, science during high school and who among those with the most talent are likely to go on to productive and eminent careers in science?"

White & Beverly R. King<br/><br/>Efforts to develop an American Indian Child Development Center on the campus of South Dakota State University in Brookings, SD, will begin with a two day workshop designed to address several issues. The workshop will help in the development of a specific mission and a set of narrowly defined research objectives. At present the purposes of a Center at SDSU would be to identify factors that influence positive development from different levels of analysis (e.g., individuals, families, and communities) and context (e.g., ethnicity, culture) among American Indian children. These influences may or may not be the same as the majority culture. Further insight into this issue is needed in order to use this information to assist American Indian children and their families in the process of understanding functional pathways to development across childhood.<br/><br/>Activities planned for the workshop include training in the life course perspective, both in terms of a theory to guide future research and in terms of designing methodologies that will be sensitive to multiple influences on American Indian child development. This will include selected faculty involved in defining the research questions and potential projects. Although much of this work will have been done prior to this time via preliminary correspondence, this initial morning session will be designed to review and refine the research questions and ensuing framework. The afternoon session will be open to the academic community at large to receive training on the life course perspective and the methodology used to work within this framework. Smaller breakout groups are anticipated to explore issues related to this paradigm. Groups will then reconvene to conclude the day's activities and to allow the consultants to respond to any final questions.<br/><br/>The second day of the workshop will include a more focused level of training from American Indian representatives from local tribes and communities. They will be asked to share presentations about their beliefs, understanding, and practice relative to children. Smaller breakout sessions will occur prior to lunch and resume after lunch. Groups will again reconvene to pull information together and provide concluding comments. Input from the tribal communities will be critical to finalizing the research questions and agenda.<br/><br/>Research collaborators will have several follow-up meetings to review the information gleaned from the workshop and integrate it into the original set of specific research questions that were developed prior to the workshop. This information will then be used to develop a more coherent and focused proposal for the development of a center. <br/><br/>Finally, visits to a few existing American Indian Centers sometime following the workshops will be invaluable. The visits may help identify ways in which a center focused on American Indian Child Development might function and how the specific research questions and ensuing projects may be facilitated."

Influences on this process which will be studied include demographic factors (such as race/ethnicity, gender, birth cohort), socioeconomic factors (parents' education, occupational status), other background variables (father a scientist) and ability. The process itself will be represented by such variables as the expressed aspirations for becoming a scientist upon high school graduation, whether students remain science majors or change into or out of a science major during college, the likelihood of attaining a college degree in science, the likelihood of continuing on in science after completing a bachelor's or master's level science degree, and the likelihood of moving into adjacent science fields following graduation from college. The project should make a major contribution to our theoretical and empirical understanding of how social factors shape some of the events between high school and mid-career which take place among students who may potentially become college educated scientists.

Consequently, the family literature is replete with comparisons between different families in order to identify those characteristics (e.g., ses, ethnicity, family composition, parenting style) which differentiate socialization outcomes in children. Critical examination suggests, however, that this ""traditional"" focus may be misplaced, since variation in outcome occurs largely within, rather than between, families. Put another way, children from the same family are as different from one another, in behavior. personality and intelligence, as are children from different families. One means by which we can understand differences within families is to consider the social constructions , (i.e., the meanings assigned to and interpretations made of interactions), that individual members bring to the socialization which takes place within the family context. In this research each member (i.e., individual parents and children) of 100, two.child nuclear families will participate in a series of questionnaires and individual interviews. The principal investigator will obtain information regarding individual perceptions or constructions of the family, its composite subsystems (i.e., the spousal relationships, the sibling relationship and parent.child relationships), and socialization. Multivariate analyses will be used to examine how individual perceptions of the family environment, including perceptions of within family subsystems (such as sibling and spousal relationships) differentiate the socialization outcomes for children in the same family. The investigation will extend the existing literature on family socialization to consider the reciprocal influence of multiple family subsystems (i.e., parent.child relationships, the sibling relationship, the spousal relationship), on individual perception and experience of the family environment and socialization. It will provide a complement to observational and sociological studies of the family, by focussing on the psychological level at which such processes occur."

The original DHS award supports the development and administration of a telephone survey with a national sample of 1,500 selected by random digit dialing. This sample is too small to make estimates about subgroups, whether these groups are defined by residential location or race/ethnicity. This project provides support to enlarge the sample (increase by 1100 respondents) to obtain better estimates of subgroups and thus enhance the ability to make subgroup comparisons. The increased support will enable the PI to sample sufficiently to obtain more stable estimates of underrepresented groups within and across both strata, and for enhanced inter-group comparisons. Specifically, this and additional support for other sources will allow the PIs to increase the sample to 3,300, with an over-sample of 1000 in the three high visibility cities and a sample of 2300 throughout the rest of the continental US. The high visibility cities is comprised of New York City (Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, Staten Island), the Washington, DC area (DC, Arlington County, Fairfax County, Prince William County, Loudoun County, Montgomery County, Prince George's County) and Los Angeles County.<br/><br/>The survey will be completed using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) over a 6-month period in English or Spanish at the request of the respondent.

Because they are engineers, the incremental education needed to teach mathematics in high school is relatively small and they can use engineering examples to provide motivation for the study of mathematics. The new teachers serve as role models and are able to encourage more of their students to pursue professional careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The engineering students in the program are recruited from south central Washington. The average resident of this area has a substantially smaller income and is much less likely to hold a BS degree than the average Washington State resident. Further, students from this area are more likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity and to attend high needs schools. They are motivated toward a teaching career by the desire of many students to return to their home communities, the relatively high pay for teachers in Washington, and support features that are effective at keeping teachers in the classroom during the critical first two years of their careers. A unique aspect of this project is the placement of the teachers in paid internship summer jobs in industry to augment their salary and keep them active in the engineering profession.<br/><br/>A significant result of this project is enhanced educational opportunities for students from Hispanic backgrounds. Each of the 12 new teachers trained in this program (four each year in years 2 through 4 of the program) influences 120 students per year. Over the four years of service required by the grant, these teachers will influence nearly 6000 students. Moreover, students will benefit from more relevant education (because engineers use math on a daily basis and can provide a real context for lesson topics) and be exposed to professional opportunities that they may not have known about previously."

Who a person knows affects their behavior and well-being in many ways including which jobs they find, which products they buy, what their political opinions are, and even whether or not they engage in criminal activities, among many other things. It is also well-documented that there is a strong tendency for people to interact with other people who are similar to themselves. This is known as ''homophily'' and has been documented in terms of ethnicity, gender, political affiliation, age, religion, profession, and a variety of other socio-economic categories. Moreover, there is evidence that interaction patterns differ depending on group size (e.g., minority groups are more likely to interact with each other). This project develops models that provide theoretical predictions concerning social network formation in the presence of a diversity of types of individuals, as well as modeling the diffusion of behavior on networks that exhibit segregation. <br/><br/>A first part of this research develops models of how friendships and other relationships form in a world where individuals are of distinct types and have higher values of interacting with their own types. The theory is based on a variation of a ''search'' model, where individuals randomly meet each other and then choose whether or not to form a relationship, or whether to continue to search. More populous types find it relatively easier to meet each other, and this affects the tendency of different groups to form inter-group friendships. This stark model provides a rich set of predicted behaviors. It offers new insights into the level of integration of a population and how inter-group ties depend on population sizes. <br/><br/>A second part of this research develops predictions of behavior in settings where heterogeneous individuals are interconnected, but with some level of segregation. This extends existing models of contagion as well as the diffusion of behavior (adoption of technologies, information transmission, etc.) to situations where the network of interactions exhibits some level of segregation. This provides a deeper understanding of when and to what extent behavior differs across partly segregated groups and how this depends on their population size and social structures. It deepens the understanding of how the segregation level of a network affects the initial thresholds for the diffusion of behavior, as well as overall eventual adoption rates in a population. <br/><br/>A third part of the research bridges these first two parts, where the decisions with whom to interact depend not only on an individual's type, but also on their anticipated behavior. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the project involves providing models that serve as a basis for empirical research on social structure, segregation, and the diffusion of various economic behaviors. It also provides new insight into the understanding of ''diversity'' and integration, and helps in developing policies aimed at improving social welfare."

Thus, the research will provide baseline data for understanding changes that may take place under a new and potentially different political and economic system. Comparison of the results with those from existing studies of entrepreneurs in China and the United States will provide insights into the social sources of growth throughout the rapidly developing Pacific Rim."

Critical attention is paid to formal organizations that mobilize individuals and present group demands and to the local and state structures that provide opportunities for influencing policy. The study is based on an historical analysis of four states, selected to vary on key attributes of race, ethnicity, and nativity as well as in organizational and state resources. %%% The research will advance our knowledge of how individuals, although disadvantaged because of their position in the community, may be able to have political influence when they become part of organizations.

A primary goal is to provide instructors with improved methods for shaping their courses and curricula so as to improve student success in STEM education, building on earlier work that produced the Science Value Inventory (SVI) and Math Value Inventory (MVI). These instruments were developed to test the idea that real STEM literacy requires students to find value in their STEM courses. Data from testing the paper versions of both instruments indicate that they are both valid and reliable. They are now in use in a variety of institutions around the country. Analysis of survey results has detected significant gender differences, and variations among instructors and curricula. Analysis has also found similarities in how students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Midwestern state universities value science. This project is more widely disseminating these tools for general education, and working on developing similar tools for STEM majors. <br/>The project phases and goals are to <br/>(1) Develop and implement an accessible, efficient web-based system for administering the MVI and SVI instruments. Project tasks being conducted include validating the online versions, and creating an automated process for recording student registration, student responses, demographic information, and submission of instructor and course information. <br/>(2) Develop new online value inventories to use with STEM majors. Project tasks being conducted include initial testing and modification of the instruments to ensure that they are valid and reliable using online protocols. This task requires the development of more sensitive instruments, because undergraduate STEM majors tend initially to place greater value on science or math (or both). The Web-based system constructed in the first phase of this work is being used to administer these inventories, analyze and distribute the results, and build a database that provides insight into how value affects STEM majors' prospects for success.<br/>(3) Conduct analyses to determine the power of these instruments in predicting student success in STEM education.

Categorical variables that summarize this type of survey data are called multiple response (or pick any/c) categorical variables. It is often of interest to test for independence between two categorical variables. When categorical variables can have multiple responses, traditional Pearson chi-square tests for independence should not be used because of the within-subject dependence among responses. This research will provide methods to test for independence between two or more multiple-response categorical variables. A modified version of the Pearson statistic will perform the test, and bootstrap procedures will provide approximate sampling distributions. First and second-order corrections will allow for chi-square distribution approximations to the sampling distribution. Generalized log linear models and multivariate binomial logit-normal models will provide a model-based approach for the test of independence. <br/><br/>Many survey questions are asked in a multiple-response manner. Examples include: ""What types of cars do you own?"" and ""For what criminal offenses have you been arrested?"" Other questions naturally fall into a multiple-response format, but some researchers avoid asking them in this format due to statistical analysis problems. For example, most survey questions dealing with ethnicity allow respondents to make only one choice, which is entirely inappropriate in today's highly multicultural population. Other researchers may analyze multiple-response questions as if they came from single-response categorical variables, which can lead to very conservative tests of independence. This research will allow researchers to incorporate these types of questions into surveys and use statistically correct methods of analysis. The research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies under the Research on Survey and Statistical Methodology Funding Opportunity."

The prevailing assumption of many journalists, responders, and observers, was that any sensible person--taking appropriate personal responsibility, making choices based on official warnings, and acting to control the situation--would evacuate. This understanding of how to act reflects a particular model of agency, one especially prevalent in European American middle class contexts (Kitayama & Uchida, 2005; Markus & Kitayama, 2003). Notably, however, the marked variation associated with social class, race, and ethnicity in U.S. sociocultural contexts has given rise to multiple models of how a person should act. Many who did not evacuate lived in largely working class and African American contexts where other models of agency, models that diverge from those invoked by the media and most observers and responders, were prevalent. The failure to understand that people engaged in different sociocultural contexts may have had different understandings of what they should have been doing and why, and that they may have needed different types of relief, is likely to have been a critical element in the system failure that accompanied Katrina. <br/><br/>A team of interviewers from diverse racial and social class backgrounds will interview Katrina survivors, contrasting the perspectives of those who stayed and those who fled prior to the disaster. The interviews will consist of a series of open-ended and multiple-choice questions designed to capture participants' models of agency-implicit ideas about how to be a normatively appropriate person. In explaining their behavior, those who evacuated prior to Katrina are expected to draw on a model of agency that is prevalent in middle class European American contexts, one that emphasizes independence, choice, personal control, and future-mindedness. In contrast, those who stayed are expected to be relatively more likely to explain their own behavior in terms of a model of agency prevalent in working class contexts, one that emphasizes interdependence with one's community and kin, staying tough and enduring hardship, maintaining integrity, and making the best of difficult circumstances. The goal of this research is not just to document differences among people, but rather to focus on a catastrophic event to demonstrate that differences in how people understand action can have profound consequences for their lived experiences, as well as for the policies and institutions that regulate relief efforts. <br/><br/>Applying a models-of-agency perspective to emergencies provides a basis for predicting why people respond differently to a call to evacuate. These differences in models of agency are not just of theoretical interest. Such knowledge is crucial for emergency preparedness. Preparing for disaster and effectively responding to it requires understanding the different meanings of the events and actions for those affected by the disaster. Without acknowledging these differences, it becomes difficult to formulate an effective response. Understanding that other models of agency organize behavior should allow emergency management to better prepare people for future situations, and to anticipate potential divergence in their response to emergency guidelines and aid."

This may be the result of national legislative efforts starting in the 1960s. Firms no longer engage in one particular form of differential treatment of men and women. Former socialist societies in Eastern Europe were committed to the principles of gender equality and the gender wage gap generally was known under socialism to be smaller than in the West. What has happened after transition from socialism to market economies is however highly contested and not known. As a backlash against socialist ideologies gender equality and affirmative action efforts became weaker or non-existent and some researchers hence claim gender inequalities-along with race, ethnicity, and class-based inequalities-grew fast. This project will investigate the gender gaps in the workplace in former socialist economies. The PI hypothesizes first, that one main source of gender inequality in the workplace-namely, unequal pay for equal work-a source that has gradually disappeared in some mature market economies, have reemerged in post-socialist economies, even when the source, was absent during state socialism. Second, that there are sex differences in wage changes, promotions, and career advancement.

It is believed that not only will well-defined and enforced property rights encourage people to invest in their land, but they will allow people access to credit through mortgages. Many countries around the world have attempted to write new laws that will make property rights more clearly defined and secure for their citizens. But, while law can be written and then accepted by legislatures, the implementation and enforcement of the new law is left to the courts and to local administrations, often far from the decision-making center of the country and with very few resources in terms of both personnel and budgets. Enforcement of new laws cannot be taken for granted in developing countries. There is often an unequal application of the law throughout the country. In this research project we will examine three different common law African countries and their land law. We will examine the text of the laws regarding property rights and the effectiveness of their implementation<br/>Specifically, we will address the following questions with regard to the enforcement of property rights in land.<br/>1) What are the mechanisms for the communication of legislative decisions from the center (the law-making bodies of the state usually the national legislatures located in the capital city) to the geographically peripheral areas of the state?<br/>2) Is there sufficient cooperation between the legislature and the judicial institutions of the state at the national and sub-national levels?<br/>3) Within a locality, who is obligated to enforce the decisions of the state? Do those people, police or local officials, with the legal obligation to enforce decisions perceive their role as such? <br/>4) Are there differences in the enforcement of laws in urban areas in the capital city where the strength of the state is most focused and in the rural areas where the state may be weaker?<br/>5) When a legal decision is made at the local level that affirms a national law but is contrary to custom or tradition, is the court decision enforced?<br/>6) Are there functioning non-legal institutional regimes in rural or urban areas which are regulating access to land independently of and/or in defiance of state law?<br/> As we ascertain the answers to these questions we will also be paying close attention to the issue of socioeconomic status, gender and ethnicity to determine if these factors seem to promote or impede the enforcement of the law. In addition to contribution to the growing research on property rights and development, the results of this project will be helpful to policymakers as it will identify the factors that impede the enforcement of law in some developing countries. There is an additional practical outcome to this project, as it will identify inequalities in the enforcement of laws regarding property for such disadvantaged groups as those infected and affected by AIDS and rural women."

It is puzzling, however, that these beliefs are often based largely upon the unordered or nominal categories, such as gender and ethnicity, to which these individuals belong. This proposal examines the interactive processes by which such consensual status values may be acquired. A theory is proposed that argues that if a correlation occurs between a given nominal characteristic and the distribution of economic resources, it constrains face-to-face interaction within the population. In encounters between people differing in both resources and the nominal characteristic, these constraints lead to an association between that characteristic and status-type beliefs. When individuals bring this status association to other encounters and treat people according to it, the structural constraints on interaction allow it to diffuse widely, and it becomes consensual. Specifically, two experiments will be conducted to test this theory. The first experiment will show whether or not an individual participant who works with a person who has a different pay level and a different nominal characteristic will form expectations states which then transfer to a later situation where that individual differs from the other person only in nominal characteristics but not in pay level. A second experiment examines a more ""advanced"" stage of the process, exploring situations in which the nominal characteristic might acquire low status value even for people who have obtained a high value of the resource. This project will contribute better understanding of the linkage between social processes at the micro-level and the distribution of resources reflecting social and economic arrangements at the macro-level. It will also provide information for researchers and policy makers who are concerned with issues of inequality and equity."

The U.S. accounted for more than 50 percent of all intercountry adoptions worldwide in 2006. Although policy-oriented approaches, focusing on issues of physical, mental, and emotional effects upon children and families dominate the literature, the study of cross-border family formation as an outcome of globalization and uneven development has not yet been fully theorized. This doctoral dissertation research project uses qualitative social science methods to study both global processes and local conditions sustaining the practice of intercountry adoption between the Philippines and the United States. The doctoral candidate will employ world systems, globalization, migration, and network theories as frameworks for analysis. Conditions and perspectives in both the sending and receiving regions will be analyzed to better understand the structural, temporal, and place-specific factors that have brought about a systematic and persistent migration of children from the Philippines to the United States in the post-World War II era. Through a series of semi-structured and in-depth interviews with U.S. embassy officials, orphanage directors and staff, foster families, staff at non-governmental organizations, representatives of local government agencies, and adoption attorneys, the student will examine the significant factors that explain intercounty adoptions from the perspective of a major source country. The study also will examine patterns of ethnicity, native language, age, economic and social conditions, and home region of recently adopted children to better understand the local conditions surrounding internationally adopted children in the Philippines. These data, in combination with interview, survey, and published data on the corresponding set of stakeholders (adoptive parents, adoption agency staff, and adoption attorneys) in the United States, will facilitate further understanding of the structural, historical, political, ecological, demographic, and economic conditions associated with this contemporary form of cross-border family formation. The results of this study will help illuminate the complex contradictions of power at play in both the sending and receiving regions of this tenuous migration stream.<br/><br/>This study will evaluate an important topic from a variety of theoretical vantage points to increase understanding about how the process of intercountry adoption operates at multiple geographical scales (global, local, and intermediary). In addition, the study will provide valuable insight on a matter that directly influences human lives and livelihoods. Findings will inform public agencies, non-profits, individuals, and the governments of both the Philippines and the United States at a crucial time when international policy is undergoing significant changes as a result of greater public awareness and the emergence of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. While the contemporary popular discourse on intercountry adoption in the U.S. has focused largely upon the needs of adopting parents and families, this study will examine societal concerns at both the sending and receiving end of the migration stream. Previous studies in anthropology, medicine, and social work have targeted China, Korea, Romania, and Russia as sources because these countries have provided large numbers of children for adoption in the United States in particular years. The Philippines, however, has not been studied in the same context, presumably because it represents fewer annual adoptions than the aforementioned places. Over the course of the past fifteen years, however, the Philippines stands as the fifth largest provider of internationally adopted children in the United States. This study will inform the literature on migration, development, and globalization while simultaneously informing public policy on an important emerging topic. In addition, this Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

There has been ample qualitative research on the informal economy. However beginning in the early 1990's the investigators have developed, refined, and implemented a technique that allows for quantitative analysis of informal work via structured surveys administered to samples of adult individuals. The study will conduct the first nationally representative household survey of informal work in the United States.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of this study is to provide an empirical examination of the contours and correlates of informal work at the national-level. We have seven basic research questions. How prevalent is informal work in the United States? How does the prevalence of informal work vary spatially (for example, across the rural-urban continuum)? What is the relationship between household labor supply in the formal economy (both in terms of quantity and quality) and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between poverty, income, and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between social capital (for example, the strength of a household's social networks) and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between standard correlates of formal labor market stratification (for example, family size, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment) and participation in informal work? What is the relationship between industrial restructuring in the formal economy and participation in informal work?<br/><br/>Data will be collected through a telephone survey administered to a nationally representative sample of up to 1,700 adults. The survey instrument will be anchored around a set of survey items that ask about participation in several specific forms of informal work. In addition, the instrument will gather basic socio-demographic and economic information about sampled households, and geo-coding will allow us to merge and incorporate contextual information on place of residence. <br/><br/>The study will make important scientific contributions. It will be the first to provide reliable and generalizable evidence about the prevalence, importance and correlates of informal work, and to provide definitive evidence concerning several empirical and debated questions such as how informal work varies with formal labor supply, social capital of households, poverty status, and rural-urban residence. The broader impact of the study includes providing basic information on an important yet neglected economic survival strategy among households in the United States today. Research findings carry important implications for social policy as well. In recent years, entrepreneurship and small-business enterprise have been touted as viable economic strategies for households and their communities that may be struggling amidst industrial restructuring and attenuated support for social welfare programs. It is important therefore to understand informal work as a potential source of entrepreneurial vitality."

However, some recent experimental evidence suggests that households are myopic in the sense that rates of time preference are very high over the near term but much lower between dates advanced some time in the future. This project will assess the theoretical implications of this form of preferences for observable macroeconomic behavior and then test the hypotheses on cross country data. The neoclassical growth model is modified to allow for a non constant rate of time preference. If the household cannot commit future choices of consumption and if utility is logarithmic, then an equilibrium is found that resembles the standard results of the neoclassical model. In this solution, the effective rate of time preference is high, but constant. Although this model has potentially important implications for institutional design and other policies- because households would benefit from an ability to commit future consumption-there is a sense in which the results are observationally equivalent to those of the conventional growth model. When the framework is extended to allow for partial commitment ability, then some testable hypotheses emerge. Steady state results are obtained for more general utility functions, and some properties of dynamic paths are worked out for the case of isoelastic utility. Further theoretical research will assess the uniqueness of the equilibria. Multiplicity of equilibria have been found in analogous contexts by other researchers but only when the household's horizon is infinite. The properties of the transitional dynamics will be worked out numerically for the case of isoelastic utility, and further testable hypotheses will be derived from the theory. The theory will also be linked with existing analyses that endogenize population growth and technological progress. Previous cross country empirical work on the determinants of economic growth will be extended to evaluate the macroeconomic significance of the kinds of time preference analysis that form the theoretical part of this research. The analysis will consider institutional and cultural elements that affect people's ability to make and enforce commitments. The institutional side will consider measures of the rule of law and political stability and other features of the legal environment that affect people's ability to organize financial markets and enter into contracts and other market relationships. The cultural side will assess aspects of religion, language, and ethnicity as possible influences on thrift, a propensity for honesty, and a willingness to work hard. In each case, the hypothesis to be tested is that the explanatory variables have joint influences across a group of dependent variables, including the rate of economic growth, the saving rate, the extent of financial market development, fertility decisions, and the intensity of investment in human capital +^"

Research on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota will analyze how economic production occurs both in family networks and through market transactions. The project will investigate how households integrate the market and the social economy using methods of time allocation and ethnographic participant observation. The project will study consumption and social networks, cash requirements, responses to new economic opportunities, and the relationships of gender, class, race and ethnicity to build models of labor time allocation and household consumption.

This research has two distinct projects that contribute to a deeper understanding of the sources of disparate treatment and how to remedy it. The first project studies disparate treatment in the context of law enforcement. Previous research on law enforcement focuses on explaining discrimination based on observable characteristics, but this project shows that disparities in treatment need not be related to observable differences. The research develops a theoretical model in which minimizing crime may require a subgroup be policed more intensely within a group of observably identical individuals. The analysis suggests that the identity of individuals subjected to more intense policing may be rotated over time, so that over time the overall impact of policing is distributed equally. This theory can help achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the trade-off between fairness and efficiency. The analysis is also applicable to other settings such as tax auditing, and it affords comparative-statics results. The theory is used to analyze data on highway speeding and to compute the benefit, in terms of lives saved, of a marginal increase in police resources. The modeling methods developed as part of this project and the estimates produce will be useful for analyzing the effectiveness of policies that reduce unsafe driving and therefore accidents.<br/><br/>The second project concerns match complementarities, mentoring and role model effects. These effects are often used to provide a rationale for affirmative action (itself a form of disparate treatment). While there has been much discussion in education, sociology, economics and psychology about mentoring and role model effects, these effects have proved difficult to demonstrate quantitatively partly to lack of detailed data to control for the endogenous nature of the matching process. This project will study matching effects in the context of higher education. A data set is constructed that allows estimation of the benefit of pairing students and instructors by race, ethnicity and gender. The estimation approach takes advantage of randomization in the process by which students are assigned to instructors. By gathering comprehensive data on the types of interactions that take place between students and instructors, the project also provides insights into the channels through which mentoring and role model effects take place. The goal of this second project is to establish the notion of mentoring and role model effects on a firm experimental basis. This research will provide a better understanding of the effects of disparate treatment."

Pearson did not take up statistics until about 1892, when he was 35 years old. Before that he worked at a remarkable variety of topics and causes, including German religious history, history of philosophy, feminism, socialism, and the ethical value and cultural significance of science. He also wrote a romantic novel and a ""nineteenth-century passion play."" In many ways his early beliefs and values seem at odds with his later advocacy of statistics in almost every domain of inquiry. As a young man he wrote movingly of his desire to know nature directly, in contrast to the putative superficiality of quantitative knowledge. Yet his career displays striking continuities as well, above all in his lifelong opposition to individualism. This was expressed early in a strong moral commitment to socialism and an impulse to dissolve the self in nature. In his later writing, he exalted the rigors of scientific method as a vehicle for taming the individual and creating citizens.<br/><br/>This work is also about objectivity, considered not mainly as a set of public, intellectual values, but rather from the standpoint of the internal life of the scientist. For Pearson, statistics was a strategy of self-discipline and renunciation. By giving up the impulse to know nature directly, he was able to define science in terms of method rather than subject matter, and in this way to universalize its claims. Pearson's early professional life provides the historian an unusual opportunity to integrate the private life with the research commitments of a mathematical scientist, and to show something of the sacrifice as well as satisfaction in fashioning a life of exact science. This work should be of interest not only to historians, but also to anyone concerned about the role of science in modern culture, or about patterns of recruitment into science according to intellectual and religious values, social class, ethnicity, and gender."

So cultural competence is an essential criterion of the successful multi- or cross-cultural collection. A culturally competent resource or collection should present accurate, non-stereotypical, and non-judgmental views of the ideas, objects, and other aspects of the culture(s) it represents; should communicate, whenever possible, in the language(s) of the culture(s) it represents; and should communicate, whenever possible, within the cultural paradigms of learning and knowing of the culture(s) it represents.<br/><br/>This collection will serve the 2.07 million Native Americans residing within the continental United States and Alaska, will provide an important science education resource for Native American students at all levels, and will help recruit Native Americans into SMET careers.

The pilot collection will also serve the general American public and engage learners who are not usually interested in science but are interested in Native American culture. The collection will serve DLESE by providing a concrete example of ""a culturally diverse collection"" for policy development, and a template for the development of more such collections The collection will serve the American scientific reseach community and the public that relies on it, by diversifying the ways that research scientists, and Americans in general, think about science and the natural world itself."

With the end of apartheid and the dramatic social, economic, and political reorganization of South Africa have come comparable changes of the nation's urban areas. The growing demand for housing coupled with chronic shortages in the housing stock have exacerbated urban change. Differences in the quality and quantity of housing coupled with various governmental policies and programs designed to alleviate the housing crisis have begun to alter the social geography of South African cities, but it is not clear whether these changes and policies are challenging the legacy of apartheid or reinforcing the apartheid landscapes of segregation. This doctoral dissertation research project will focus on a case study of the rental housing market in Cape Town in two phases. The first phase will focus on the collection of empirical data about the changing geography of the rental housing market. The second phase will use three kinds of surveys to gather quantitative data and qualitative information from rental households, local residents, and local officials. Structured interviews with 600 rental households drawn from a stratified clustered random sample will provide data about changing social and spatial patterns of rental housing as well as changing perceptions and key issues of concern among rental households. In-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted with at least 60 rental households to qualitatively explore changing social realities and mental landscapes of tenants. Finally, individual and group open-ended interviews will be conducted with non-governmental as well as other local organizations involved in issues related to housing provision and policy. This project will advance understandings of the changing character of housing markets in contemporary South African cities, and it will have practical utility for those engaged in policy making for rental housing in that nation. The significance of this research extends beyond South Africa's borders, however, because this project will examine the difficulties in transforming urban systems that have been stratified territorially based on ethnicity and race. As such, it will offer insights into the interplay between formal government policies, socioeconomic dynamics, and cultural factors that affect the ways that different groups of people relate to each other as they reorganize the spaces they occupy and use in urban settings. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

A comprehensive theory of language must explain both what goes on in the minds of individual speakers and how those individuals attend to and coordinate with their interlocutors. Psycholinguists study the unconscious mental processes involved in speaking and understanding language; sociolinguists study how social factors like age, gender, class, ethnicity, and regional differences influence language use. These two types of investigators often study the same linguistic phenomena from their own perspective, but there have been few attempts to combine the perspectives.<br/><br/>A special session at the 2011 meeting of the annual CUNY Conference on Human Sentence Processing will focus on the role of processing in language variation and change.

National-level activities, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, have positively impacted thousands of women. They cannot, however, reach all women. In particular, national meetings have limited ability to recruit women from isolated areas of the country, to include women at institutions that cannot afford expensive and time-consuming travel to national meetings, to provide leadership roles, to encourage participation by high school students, and to support interactions that are frequent enough to spark and sustain collaborations among budding students and professionals. This project -- called WWW.2 for Wide Web of Women -- aims to overcome these impediments. The project will create twelve new and upgraded Regional Celebrations of Women in Computing that will bring students, faculty and indistry representatives together for biennial conferences. The conferences will increase women?s participation in computing through intentional role modeling, networking, group and indivudal career mentoring, providing career information, and oportunities for experiences in presenting their work. The attendees will be encouraged to continue their interactions between Celebrations, for example, by forming ACM-W student chapters, hosting multi-institutional get togethers, and maintaining connections through a wiki. Focusing on women (as well as regions) serves a population powerfully united by gender, yet diverse in experience, with personal stories varying by race, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation. This ""Web of Women"" will build momentum toward a tipping point of cultural change in stereotypes about gender and computing."

Specifically, the project examines how rural legal aid centers address certain externalities of China's economic development and its concomitants of urbanization and migration, namely, the legal consequences of changing policies toward real property and its regulation. Transitional China shows the emergence of new privatized actors operating within socialist administrative systems. These relationships are both produced by and productive of valuations of land, its use, ownership, and transfer, which differ markedly from those of just a generation ago. Emergent markets in rural land complicate views of land value held by local social groups defined by region, religion, and ethnicity. Land laws, as the product of compromise and calculation, may create a set of conditions preferable to the realization of certain types of value of land over others. The leading question of this research, therefore, is: what role do legal aid centers play in mediating the different modalities of land ownership held by diverse actors in transitional societies? <br/><br/>To address this question, the project compares the operation of different legal aid centers in rural China to examine the capacity of such institutions to address differences in views toward the use, value, and meaning of land. The methodology employed is on-site participation in client counseling and observation of claimants' visits to legal aid centers and their interaction with legal aid personnel. Further, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with members of the local community as to the wider impact of the legal aid center. The project uses the case of China to build theory about the role of public interest law in transitional economies."

These dynamics have practical significance because the use of stereotypes by powerful decision makers has more impact than their use by the less powerful. They have theoretical significance because the lowered social contingency (lack of reciprocal outcome dependency) of powerful people paves the way for more autonomous motives to guide their impression formation (e.g., values, individual differences, relationships external to the power relation). The relative lack of contingency of the powerful also creates a greater challenge for influencing them. Six studies will test the PI's theor y utilizing two paradigms supported by preliminary data. These paradigms employ both manipulations of power and individual differences and include a range of stereotyped targets varying in ethnicity, race, and gender. The first three studies test the hypothesis that the powerful do not need to attend to their subordinates. One implication of this perspective is that the powerless may become anxious, a prediction supported by previous work. To examine this implication, three additional studies investigate the dynamics of power and control feelings to test a related hypothesis: Some kinds of power do not make the powerless anxious, and so avoid the debilitating interpersonal effects of anxiety. Together, these six studies examine situational and personality dynamics of the relationship between power and stereotyping, as mediated by control feelings and capacity limitations. Studies of power and stereotyping are critical to the nation's effective use of its human capital. Stereotypes ignore the merits of the individual. Thus, powerful decision makers who stereotype their subordinates will make uninformed, inefficient, and ineffective decisions. Yet the PI's theory, tested in this program of research, suggests that the powerful are especially vulnerable to stereotyping. It also suggests that a dominating, stereotypic leadership style undermines subordinate performance. This research will reveal how the powerful can avoid the debilitating effects of stereotypes and make the best use of the available human resources."

Questions that follow from this include: What mechanisms promote homogeneity or heterogeneity in political choice in neighborhoods or work groups? In what ways do the social contexts of work, recreation, or neighborhood life filter the perception of politically relevant information coming from the mass media or other persons? What mechanisms of social interaction enhance or inhibit social influences on political choice? In the highly dynamic context of a political campaign, how does the political influence of social context evolve over time? What mechanisms govern the changing course of social influence on political choice during a campaign? To address these questions the investigators have undertaken a three wave panel survey of 1,500 voters in South Bend, Indiana, before, during, and after the 1984 election campaign. A supplemental survey of almost 1,000 persons identified by respondents as political discussion partners was also completed. This survey employed a research design and sampling technique that differed markedly from traditional practice. Extensive scientific study of mass political behavior, especially voting behavior, has been undertaken over the past four decades utilizing national random sample survey techniques. The current investigation differs from this methodology in two important respects. First, the research site is a particular urban community. Second, the sampling design randomizes respondent selection, but within purposefully chosen neighborhoods that differ systematically in social and economic composition. A high sampling rate within each neighborhood allows the investigators to characterize each neighborhood environment. This design is believed to be unique in the study of voting behavior in that it provides for direct, comprehensive measurement of the social, attitudinal, economic, and political characteristics of the voter's immediate social milieu. The data set resulting fom these procedures provides analytic opportunities unavailable in the usual national election studies. In the determinants of voter choice or policy attitudes, measurements of respondents' social contexts may be introduced directly into the analysis. The relative importance of individual properties compared with the political influence arising from the social composition of the respondent's neighborhood can be assessed. For example, a body of evidence suggests that vote choice by working class respondents is heavily influenced not only by their working class membership but also by the concentration of working class families in their living areas. This classic effect of social context on voting behavior can be specified in extraordinary detail with the data set now available from South Bend. What mechanisms of social interaction drive this observed amplification of working class influence on individual members of the working class? Is it the composition of their political discussion networks? Is it the composition of their work groups? Is it the homogeneity of other social cleavages within their neighborhoods - - race, religion, ethnicity? Such questions can be raised, and given answers in first approximation, with these data."

Property rights are the form of institutional arrangements that will be the focus of research. Forests constitute the resource type to be studies. <br/>The research is carried out in the Kumaon region of the Indian Middle Himalaya where nearly 5000 village-level community forests exist side by side with privately held forests and other forests managed by the Revenue and Forest Departments of the Indian government. The investigator selects 100 cases and, in each case, four different forms of tenure over forests exist. The existence of different tenurial forms in the same region provides an ideal setting in which to examine l) the effect of pro0perty rights in comparison to other factors that are often asserted to influence the condition of resources (the research pays specific attention to population, migration, market, and cultural perceptions about resources), and 2) the different impact of variations in property regimes on forest condition, and 3) the importance of different monitoring and enforcement mechanisms in the effectiveness of property rights regimes. <br/>The data set constructed and analyzed through the research complements an earlier data set created by the investigator through research in the Kumaon region to study intensively forest management institutions in 24 villages. The existing data was collected using a stet of ten questionnaires that allow researchers to relate resource condition to biological, climatic and edaphic, socio-economic, demographic, and institutional variables.<br/>By locating and identifying the processes and precise means whereby institutional arrangements influence resource management and conditions, the research lends greater specificity to attempted policies on the subject. In addition, few studies have undertaken a comparative examination either of the relative importance of property rights in comparison to larger socio-economic or climatic variables, or of the variable influence of different property regimes. Thus, this research enhances significantly our understanding of the topic."

It will examine the institutional culture of and relationships between organizations involved in co-management, and map how these initiatives provide an arena to strengthen, negotiate and contest claims to forest resources at the local level. The Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and its co-management initiative in East Kalimantan will be the focal points through which these issues are examined. The study seeks to understand the process of knowledge production about forests and forest dependent communities in Indonesia, as well as the consequences of that knowledge for forest dependent communities. Research objectives are as follows: (1) to document the processes of and identify the factors that affect selecting, implementing and reporting research on forest co-management in Indonesia by CIFOR; (2) to trace the types and flows of information between CIFOR and other actors at local, regional and national levels; (3) to examine how local level actors negotiate and contest rights and claims to forest resources and determine how CIFOR's co-management initiative affects these contestations and negotiations; (4) to compare the consequences of CIFOR's intervention with the initiative's intentions; and (5) to contribute to a broader theoretical understanding of the culture and political economy of institutions that produce knowledge about forests and forest dependent people. Meeting these objectives requires an ethnographic focus on how knowledge is produced, used and transformed. Over a 12-month period, multi-sited research will be conducted in Indonesia, employing the following methods: participant observation, semi-structured and open-ended interviews, and content analysis of documents. Using this set of methods will allow triangulation of interview, observational and documentary data collected from multiple sources, as well as the analysis of the continuities and disjunctures between data sources. On a logistical level, collaborating with CIFOR provides the necessary access to conduct this study successfully.<br/>This study will contribute to theoretical debates concerned the culture and political economy of knowledge producing institutions, and the effects of that knowledge at global, national and local levels. Investigating the institutional culture of a forestry institution fills a major gap in the literature on development and environmental institutions. It also contributes to the science studies literature by investigating the nexus of science and management, and moving from the laboratory sciences, which has been most examined, to the field sciences and their application, which has been least studied. While most studies of forestry institution interventions at the village level limit their scope to village level dynamics, this study integrates an understanding of an intervention at the village level with an investigation of the institutional culture that gave rise to it, as well as analyzes the interplay between village and institutional realities. In doing so, it interrogates the assumed boundaries between western knowledge and its non-western subjects and between experts and those ostensibly in need of expertise."

This system will facilitate research in textual analyses, conversation and interaction analysis and statistical computing - all areas in which faculty members specialize. Historical sociologists rely heavily on texts and search and analyze them based on particular works and phrases - a very time consuming process. With the new system, it will be possible to scan such materials into the computer and conduct quick and efficient searches. This will facilitate current work such as the study of peasant economics and the relationship between agricultural production practices and a range of social variables. Interaction analyses focus on the relationship between individuals and this will be facilitated by two laboratories with visual and sound equipment. Issues such as the relationship between doctors and patients can be studied and feedback is directly useful in physician training. Because, in good part, of lack of appropriate instrumentation, powerful new techniques developed by statisticians are rarely used in the social sciences and the equipment provided will make many of these available not only to senior researchers, but to graduate and undergraduate students as well."

As cyberinfrastructure becomes integrated into research, there are accompanying changes in work practices, requisite skill sets, organizing structures and career trajectories. Research on these concomitant changes is in its earliest stages so it has focused predominantly on commonalities among the majority of scientists. However, previous literature has determined that there is often considerable variation in the ways that majority and minority groups within a field experience scientific work. Very little is know about the different experiences of minority group members working in multi-disciplinary, distributed collaborative research teams or about their distinctive work practices within those collaborative projects. As scientific and engineering research moves toward this new cyber-enabled collaborative model, understanding both majority and minority member experiences will be crucial to the design, development and deployment of appropriate cyberinfrastructure support tools and will have important implications for increasing participation among members of underrepresented groups. This research is a first step in identifying best practices in use so that all groups can be fully supported in scientific and engineering research collaborations.<br/><br/>This project investigates how women scientists engaged in collaborative, multidisciplinary research build and use interpersonal relationships and the effects of these relationships on their careers. Using ethnographic methods and narrative analysis, the research team will conduct a pilot study of researchers using large-scale databases in astronomy to identify everyday research practices, the organization of work, planning, career trajectories, and the transmission of knowledge to the next generation of scholars. They will focus on collaborative work practices, the design, maintenance, revision and interpretation of large-scale databases, their career strategies, and on mentoring activities. Further, it will shed light on whether underrepresented groups are more likely to succeed in new fields or using new methods and are more likely to engage in interdisciplinary research. If so, they may be a crucial asset in innovation and transformative science. <br/><br/>This research has important implications for both theory and practice. It investigates an area related to cyberinfrastructure use and team science and engineering that is currently understudied: How do minority group members use cyberinfrastructure and the emergent team science structure to achieve success? How can this information inform the development and refinement of the next generation of cyberinfrastructure? What steps can be taken to improve participation by members of underrepresented groups? New cyberinfrastructure tools have enabled transformative changes for some areas of science and engineering, but little is known about which of these changes differ for various groups and how each achieves success. Results of this project could enable us to design collaborative science and engineering projects that increase the participation of underrepresented groups and provide valuable information for the development of appropriate cyberinfrastructure to support a variety of work practices. Identifying the experiences of minority group members will enable funding agencies to better understand how to support and nurture the work required to meet future scientific and engineering challenges and improve national competitiveness."

Situated learning, a major theory about cognition and education, centers on apprenticeship in ""communities of practice"" (moving from newcomer to expert within a sociocultural structure of practices). MUVEs are a promising medium for fostering and assessing classroom-based situated learning because they can support immersive, extended experiences incorporating modeling and mentoring about problems similar to those in real world contexts. This project will extend an educational MUVE developed with prior NSF funding; its curriculum is based on a problem-solving community in which students gain knowledge through co-interpreting data with other participants who have varied levels of skills. This project will study whether such a virtual environment can sufficiently replicate authentic contexts and multi-leveled communities of practice to provide students with classroom experiences in situated learning.<br/><br/>In addition, the limited ability of students to apply school-acquired knowledge to real world settings is a longstanding, crucial problem that a controlled study of instructional design for situated learning could help to clarify. ""Transfer"" is the application of knowledge learned in one situation to another situation and is demonstrated if instruction on a learning task leads to improved performance on a transfer task, typically a real world setting requiring expert performance. MUVEs provide a unique experimental vehicle for studying how situated affordances (supports for particular activities created by relevant properties of the situation) and constraints (regularities that are invariant under the transformation that changes the learning situation into the transfer situation) affect students' capabilities for learning and transfer. Situated learning involves constellations of architectural, social, organizational, and material vectors that shape particular settings.<br/><br/>This project will develop and study multiple variants of a learning environment in which these vectors are manipulated, allowing investigation into near and far transfer. The project will develop MUVE-based curricula centered on alternative models of situated or constructivist learning and will assess their differential outcomes for student motivation and learning, as well as interface usability and classroom implementation. The project will implement these alternative curricula in Boston Public School (BPS) classrooms with high proportions of ESL and free-and-reduced-lunch students, matching experimental to control classrooms to determine the relative efficacy of our approach."

More than a billion people, some 20 percent of the world population, live on less than one dollar a day; most of them in rural conditions where natural resources provide a tenuous but vital lifeline. In conditions of extreme poverty, disruptions to the natural resource lifeline are acute, whether from shocks associated with political factors like wars or poor governance, environmental factors like drought or floods, or health-related factors like HIV or malaria. The lack of financial or other buffers exaggerates the effects of system shocks and changes household survival strategies. In this research project, the investigators hypothesize that the fundamental design and valuation of protected areas can be updated to mitigate the effects of these systems shocks. This project will integrate health, climate change, ecology, remote sensing, history and economics to develop the scenarios required to accurately forecast future resource use. Located in two study sites in Central Mozambique and Western Uganda, the research will be undertaken in some of the most vulnerable and resource-dependent societies on earth. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will involve several different methods of analysis: (1) a reconstruction of resource use history during times of stress and mapping temporary migration patterns; (2) an economic analysis of the role and value of natural resources in the household strategies and the effect of resource shocks to this strategy; and (3) a spatial analysis of the location and likelihood of resource use based on current conditions and the simulation of scenarios based on government, health, climate and economic changes. The investigators expect to extend traditional static mapping that simply locates poverty and other similar conditions by creating a dynamic model that will assess changes in population and resource demands over time.<br/><br/>This research will bring new light to strategic resource use planning and protection by basing it on a convergence of perception, empirical analysis, and forecasted conditions. Forecasting resource demands under different shocks, providing accurate valuation of those resources, and tying it together in a new protected area paradigm in which set aside value includes possible temporary access is expected to encourage the long-term economic viability of resource protection. The research will develop a means to link non-market household activities with resource value. It therefore should facilitate the development of effective protected-area strategies and identify alternative investments that may reduce the demand for park resources. A focus on U.S. graduate and undergraduate education and training will be complimented with an emphasis on local counterpart researcher involvement. The results and raw data will be made widely available to government and international agencies.

In order to achieve our mission, the goal of our institutional transformation start-up project is to develop an evidence-based approach toaddress factors resulting in the under-representation of women in STEM faculty positions at RIT. Objectives supporting achievement of this goal include: 1) Identify barriers for current women faculty in regards to rank, tenure and leadership role progression, 2) Examine faculty recruitment patterns in terms of gender equity, and 3) Establish how well RIT does in addressing these factors when compared with the competition. Through initiatives currently underway, from the Women in Engineering Program?s tremendous growth to the President?s launching of an Equity Scorecard program, RIT has gathered momentum to position itself for institutional change in regards to gender inclusiveness and equity within faculty ranks. The proposed NSF project will allow RIT to build upon this energy and accelerate the transformation process through careful data driven studies of our current position.<br/><br/>Our proposed activities fall into assessment and evaluation general categories using: a) current climate with respect to gender inclusiveness, and b) benchmark data comparing RIT against peer institutions in regards to policies, hiring/retention/promotion patterns.

This research evaluates this claim by analyzing neighborhood variation in crime within cities. The project also probes the impact of racial difference in communities by examining neighborhoods that are racially variant, but similarly situated in economic status. Crime data for neighborhoods in 75 cities with populations over 100,000 are collected. These crime data are combined with socio-demographic data for cities and tracts from census and other published sources to construct a contextual data set of neighborhoods characteristics with city variables appended to each neighborhood unit. These data are used to conduct multi-level analyses evaluating the direct and indirect effects (through neighborhood conditions) of city labor market structure, socioeconomic inequality, and population change on neighborhood crime. Further, the analyses assess whether and how city contextual factors condition the influence of neighborhood social disorganization, structural disadvantage, and socioeconomic inequality on crime. Finally, the research examines the extent to which neighborhood conditions (particularly economic status) have similar influences on crime in predominantly black and white neighborhoods. The research will determine whether and how a number of important city-level factors influence neighborhood crime by empirically evaluating the multifaceted influences of the macro-structural context on local community crime using cutting-edge statistical procedures. The project will also demonstrate whether the influences of socioeconomic conditions on crime are (or are not) invariant across areas with varying racial compositions, and whether the answers to these two issues are the same for different types of criminal behavior. The knowledge gained from addressing these questions will help explicate the determinants of neighborhood crime, and provide a foundation to inform public debate about the differential consequences of de-industrialization."

The Consortium will coordinate empirical and theoretical research multidisciplinary research and research training across a broad range of individual and societal aspects related to the subject of interpersonal violence. The Consortium is comprised of a team of prominent researchers with a significant variety of disciplinary backgrounds (i.g. biology, criminology, economics geography, operations research, political science, psychology, public health, public policy, sociology, statistics) and extensive research experience and methodological expertise that will be applied to the study of violence. This multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research team consists of 39 individuals at 24 institutions in 11 states and 4 countries. The Consortium will focus on increasing knowledge about the dynamics of violence at three levels of violence: (1) Individual Development Level--how and why people develop into violent individuals, and how and why they cease to be violent; (2) Situational Dynamics Level--how and why some conflict situations escalate into actual violent encounters, while others do not; and (3) Community Dynamics Level, how and why some communities, including public-housing communities in particular, develop high levels of violence. As an integral part of its extensive research agenda, the Consortium is strongly committed to training the next generation of scholars in research on violence. This will be accomplished through a post-doctoral program that emphasizes strong technical and research skills; a decentralized pre-doctoral program; re cruitment of undergraduates to do research with consortium members; and recruitment as research collaborators faculty members from institutions with large minority populations. External communications, especially with practitioners and policy-makers, will also be an important activity. Spurred by the extremely high levels of violence in the United States compared to other industrial nations, and by the dramatic rise in violence among young people in recent years, interpersonal violence has emerged as a highly salient matter of public concern that urgently needs major concerted scientific attention. The search for effective public policy and intervention strategies has made it clear that much more intense effort is needed to develop sophisticated and comprehensive scientific approaches to generate valid and applicable knowledge about the many facets of violence. In supporting this National Consortium, the National Science Foundation seeks to create a vehicle to advance fundamental knowledge on violence and to serve a catalytic and leadership role in stimulating new scientific connections on this issue. ***"

On the basis of associated ceramic remains these have been dated to the Classic period (300-900 AD) and are associated with the Mixtequilla civilization. Dr. Stark now wishes to set them into a broader geographic context and reconstruct the functional relationships among them. To accomplish this goal she will conduct a large scale surface survey of surrounding regions to locate additional structures and complexes. Surface materials including pottery and stone artifacts will be collected and analyzed. On this basis it will be possible to date individual occurrences, determine the degree of interaction among them and gain insight into the range of manufacturing and subsistence activities which took place. Based on relative size and associated remains it will also be possible to determine the extent to which individual features were incorporated into a centralized hierarchical political structure. Although archaeologists know a great deal about the Mayan civilization, this is only one of many cultures which flourished in prehistoric Middle America. Scientists wish to understand the range of variation in political, economic and social organization which characterizes these complex entities and the Mixtequilla civilization provides an excellent source of data. Although the number of habitation groups is surprisingly high in the relatively small region surveyed, it is not clear how they fit (or don't fit) together. Were they closely integrated into a single hierarchical system or did individual units function with relative autonomy, in contrast to the Classic lowland Mayan case?

The focus of her research will be on culturally mediated risk factors for type 2 diabetes within Cambodian American communities in Connecticut. <br/><br/>Watkins' research will engage both established risk factors for diabetes and also sociocultural factors, including ""status syndrome"" (those with lower status are at risk due to limited control and decreased social participation) and cultural consonance (the ability to live according to the standards of a culture). She will use a multi-methods approach. She will undertake participant observation and semi-structured interviews to produce an ethnographic description of how diabetes is culturally situated in a population that has a history of trauma, starvation, and migration. She will use structured interviews to collect quantitative measures of established (BMI, blood pressure, family history, nutrition, cholesterol, and physical activity) and culturally mediated factors, including mental health, perceived control, social participation, and cultural consonance.<br/><br/>These data will allow Watkins to do a comparative assessement of the explanatory power of both established risk factors and status syndrome and cultural consonance measures, for diabetes risk within Cambodian American communities. This will be the first time such a comparison has been done for this community. By applying anthropological theory and methods to an escalating public health threat, the research will contribute to an understanding of socio-cultural factors in chronic disease and health disparities. It will contribute to a better understanding of biocultural factors that may place anyone at increased risk for diabetes. This research is a partnership between academia and community, ensuring that the research is both theoretically and practically grounded from the development of the research topic to the dissemination of findings. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."

It argues that because cooperation (reciprocal altruism) varies extensively cross-culturally, that culture must play a major role in shaping pro-social norms. Culturally transmitted beliefs (norms) concerning pro-sociality maintain cooperation among large groups of unrelated individuals despite the evolutionary expectation that ""free-riders"" will undermine the viability of the group. The two migrant groups chosen for the study differ significantly in their cultural patterns of cooperation. The research is framed within theories of economic/evolutionary ecology."
