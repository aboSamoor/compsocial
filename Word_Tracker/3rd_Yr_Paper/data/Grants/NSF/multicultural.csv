Moreover, recent globalization is not a uniquely American phenomenon; the number of people living with multiple cultural identities has greatly increased across the globe. As a result, an increasing number of individuals persistently face the challenge of navigating between multiple cultural identities. This research will focus on how individuals negotiate their multiple identities. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ying-yi Hong, one of the eminent scholars in the field of multicultural identity, at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Singapore is considered one of the most multicultural nations in the world, and thus an ideal location for studying multicultural identity. <br/><br/>This research will measure how cognitive styles facilitate integration of multiple cultural identities and how people manage conflicts between identities. In Study 1, participants will complete a task that measures ability to resolve conflict, as well as self-reported measures of multicultural identity integration. The relationship between these two measures will be tested. In Study 2, the relationship between multicultural identity integration and the resolution of intrapersonal (role) conflicts will be measured. In this study, participants will be presented with a series of hypothetical role conflicts and asked to generate solutions to these conflicts. For example, a working student may be presented with the conflict of staying late at work or going home to study for finals. The influence of an individual's cultural identity integration on their solutions will be measured. Finally, both studies will investigate whether participants' impressions of certain characteristics of Singapore influence how they adapt to the culture. In conclusion, this research seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and outcomes of multicultural identity integration and how these processes are moderated by perceptions of the cultural context. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Singapore."

At the root of this problem is the lack of science content knowledge preparation of elementary teachers. Elementary teachers often are only required to take as many as three science courses for certification, and they often are not exposed to a variety of pedagogical strategies for working effectively with girls in the classroom. These two factors, combined with a broad and superficial elementary science curriculum, work against making SMET relevant to students at an early age. At the same time, there is a desperate need to implement innovative and responsive intervention programs. Therefore, the proposed study will build on current research on gender inclusive teaching, inquiry-based learning, multicultural education, and sociocultural and constructivism to provide an alternate framework for enhancing the academic performance and participation of girls in SMET.<br/> Hence, we seek to explore the following research questions:<br/> 1. In what ways does an inquiry-based, sociocultural constructivist, and multicultural orientation to teaching enhance cooperating and preservice teachers' abilities to work effectively with girls in the elementary classroom?<br/> 2. In what ways does an inquiry-based, sociocultural constructivist, and multicultural orientation to teaching enhance girls' attitudes toward and academic performance in SMET?<br/>In what ways does an inquiry-based, sociocultural constructivist, and multicultural orientation to teaching help address the factors that negatively influence upper elementary girls' attitudes and academic performance in SMET over a period of three years (i.e., grades 4 though 6)?<br/> To explore these research questions, a three-year longitudinal study will be conducted. Three two-week summer institutes for 36 elementary teachers. The first institute will start with science, followed by mathematics and science, and then the integration of SMET during the third institute. Gender inclusive, minds-on activities will be modeled by the principal investigators in collaboration with three master teachers. Participating teachers will also be responsible for preparing a two-week curriculum unit in teams according to the grade level in which they teach. Data on pupil attitudes toward and performance grade level in science and mathematics will be gathered via questionnaires, unit pre- and post- content knowledge tests, and ethnographic interviews with a focus group.<br/> Preservice teachers will be paired with the teachers who participated in the summer workshop to increase the opportunities for professional development. Finally, the cooperating teachers' growth will be followed up as the girls in their classrooms progress from grades 4 to 6. Data will be analyzed using an ethnographic approach. Thus, all participants will be visited regularly using an ethnographic approach. Thus, all participants will be visited regularly by the research team, and several in-depth interviews and classroom observations will be conducted at key times during the course of the study. The results of this study should increase our understanding of how to effectively prepare teachers to teach SMET in gender inclusive and socially relevant ways. Similarly, this study will add insights on how to enhance the academic performance and attitude toward science of girls in diverse elementary schools."

The dual needs of innovation and adaptability make teams the focus for skill development, knowledge sharing, and action. Moreover, the push toward collaboration and teamwork is global, as critical expertise is sought wherever it is located. Aided by technology, virtual teaming is ubiquitous. This has increased the diversity of team members and the heterogeneity of their cultural and ethnic backgrounds. This places primary emphasis on melding diversity and minimizing the potential for fragmentation, subgroup formation, and faultlines that fracture teams. Modern work teams are increasingly global, multicultural, and virtual. Given the increasing prominence of multicultural teams, one would expect that there would be a strong scientific foundation and conferences devoted to this topic, but that is not the case. There are literatures on culture and diversity, but they are not team centric. There are well-developed literatures on composing, training and developing, leading, and managing teams, but a focus on multicultural issues and their implications for team effectiveness theory and research is diffuse. This represents a significant gap in the literature. The purpose of the conference is to surface key conceptual gaps, synthesize differing perspectives, and advance an agenda for theory development and research to enhance multicultural team effectiveness. Multicultural team effectiveness encompasses important substantive topics of culture, diversity, and team effectiveness. Integrating these topics advances broader scientific and societal concerns as well. Recent research shows that science and engineering are increasingly collaborative and cross-disciplinary, and that collaborative science has more impact. Collaborative science entails multicultural teams. Advancing knowledge of how to ensure the success of multicultural teams will also advance diversity in science and technology.<br/><br/>Technical Description <br/><br/>There is a clear need to develop a more integrated understanding of the effects of culture and diversity across the spectrum of topics relevant to forming, developing, and leading effective teams. The fragmented literature necessitates theoretical integration, new research to close knowledge gaps, and the development of innovative applications to aid teamwork in multicultural contexts. The conference is designed to advance this integration by (a) targeting key experts across core topic areas (i.e., culture, diversity, team training, team leadership, and team effectiveness); (b) having them share their knowledge and insights on new developments across core topics; and (c) engaging them and diverse conference participants in interactive, focused discussion sessions to integrate ideas, identify gaps, and propose promising directions for synthesis, theory development, and new research. This approach will help to integrate this fragmented literature and to organize a coherent framework for conceptual progress, research advancement, and practical applications to improve multicultural team effectiveness. In addition, products from the conference will be publically available. Presentation materials and consented videos of presentations will be available for downloading from the Consortium for Multicultural Psychology Research (CMPR) website at the Department of Psychology, Michigan State University."

The group is working together to change the way introductory physics is taught in a particularly challenging context. The project focuses on strategies and curricula that are student-centered, based on physics education research, and that integrate advances in instructional technology, but that were all developed for a different audience. <br/><br/>Most of the successful reform strategies require significant interactions among students and between students and instructor. Therefore the adaptation requires care, since students come from many different cultures and most speak English as a second language. The intellectual merit of this project is in using the tools of physics education research to systematically study how students learn and to develop an understanding of issues specific to the multicultural context. The project is having a significant impact within the department and institution. In addition, this project making a much broader impact nationally because the college is representative of a large number of multicultural urban colleges"

Ongoing political debate over the issue was only exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 because major immigrant flows to Western Europe are from Muslim countries. In this context, the Netherlands is the only Western European nation to commit itself to the ideal of constructing a ""multicultural state."" The Dutch state sees this policy ideal as crucial because it will maintain the coherence of the increasingly multi-ethnic country, alleviate growing fear and suspicion of immigrants among sections of the population, and overcome growing ethnic segregation in the big cities. But while this is the policy ideal, a massive political shift has occurred in favor of anti-immigrant parties, and increasing segregation occurs in the big cities. Current academic analysis lacks a grounded empirical focus on the relationships between multicultural policy ideals and their implementation and negotiation in urban space. This doctoral dissertation research project explores this connection in four neighborhoods in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The project asks the following questions: What constitutes policies aimed at integration and multiculturalism? What are their roots in different cycles of migration? Who defines these policies? How is the implementation of policy negotiated geographically? How do they affect socio-spatial interaction in urban space? To answer these questions, the investigator will draw on a variety of methods, including the collection and analysis of census data, an extensive archival study of policy documents, semi-structured interviews with key actors involved in multicultural policy development and implementation, and semi-structured interviews and participant observation in four comparative local case studies. These methods will address how it is that within an overarching state commitment to multiculturalism, policy is negotiated differently in different urban neighborhoods in the two largest cities in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>This research examines the uneven geographies of state multiculturalism and integration policies. It examines how diverse urban populations in different neighborhoods of Dutch cities negotiate an overarching national state commitment to multiculturalism differently, and it highlights the implications of this differential negotiation for policy at various scales and for geographic understandings of multi-ethnic cities. The research will contribute to geographical understanding of urban transformation in multi-ethnic societies, and it may impact teaching and policy in multi-ethnic societies. The project will impact the literature on multiculturalism and the production of urban space, state-immigrant relations, and active citizenship by emphasizing the increasing importance many Western states place on promoting active citizenship as a means for promoting social cohesion in multi-ethnic societies. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

Engineering work has become increasingly complex, and big engineering projects are almost always undertaken by teams of engineers whose members are multicultural and distributed around the globe. Effective coordination is crucial for success, yet recent research suggests that team coordination practices vary with national culture. Experts have warned that engineering education fails to prepare engineers for these differences.<br/><br/>We will use scripts theory, which lies at the intersection of the fields of social psychology and artificial intelligence, to characterize the culturally-specific coordination practices of engineering teams, introducing the notion of ""cultural coordination scripts."" We will 1) characterize and understand the coordination scripts of several specific cultures, 2) show how cultural coordination scripts are intertwined with technical training and technical tasks and 3) determine how differences in cultural coordination scripts in multi-cultural globally-distributed teams affect their capacity to coordinate highly precise work and achieve innovative, safe, timely and cost-effective outcomes. We seek to predict likely points of coordination failure. Data collection will include unobtrusive longitudinal observation of the coordination activities of mono-cultural and multi-cultural collocated and distributed engineering design teams.<br/><br/>This research program will help engineers -- and others who work in multicultural, multi-national project teams -- become more adept in anticipating and working across different cultural expectations related to project coordination. Recommendations will be developed for engineering education and practice. Cultural differences in coordination practices are understudied across domains of application, so our work will provide new knowledge concerning this central team process. We also offer a new approach to capturing the complexity of teamwork ""an approach grounded in scripts theory"" that has the potential to influence research across disciplines."

The current proposal seeks to develop a more elaborate skilled perceptual-memory account of the CRE that is grounded broadly in the cognitive skill acquisition literature. The intellectual merit of the proposal is aimed towards advancing our theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, and bridging the findings of such a framework to field investigators and eyewitnesses in multicultural communities. Given the over-representation of minorities in the U.S. prison system, yet their under-representation in the law enforcement community, each of the proposed studies will focus upon the participation of Hispanic and Black individuals. Florida International University, located in Miami, Florida, provides a unique multicultural setting for exploring this phenomenon. Thus, the broader impacts of the proposal involve improving the discrimination and identification of CR faces for field investigators working in such multicultural communities or in other countries, and reducing the fallibility of eyewitness evidence leading to the wrongful conviction of these minority populations. The first three studies in the proposal are designed to address remaining issues of theoretical interest, including the assessment of early perceptual processes in the CRE. In Study 1, the variation in research exploring the expertise-based ""inversion effect"" within the CR domain will be assessed, and a paradigm will be proposed to validate predictions based upon a skilled perceptual-memory framework. Study 2 will explore several aspects of expert-novice performance differences that have received little attention in the CR domain, including (a) perceptual identification, (b) short-term memory span, and (c) ""speedup"" in recognition performance. Recent research on ""change blindness"" has provided a paradigm for exploring attentional and metacognitive effects of perception, including expert-novice differences, and Study 3 will explore such effects in the perception of own- and other-race faces. The final three studies are designed to examine the potential application of a skilled memory framework of the CRE. Given recent national events and the over-representation of minorities in the criminal justice system, of critical necessity is the development of a training program that can be administered to field investigators working in local multicultural communities or in other countries. A 2-week intervention will be tested in Study 4 involving a novel computer-based discrimination and memory task. Study 5 will attempt to extend previous research on the construction and assessment of own- and other-race photograph lineups, while Study 6 will introduce a novel paradigm for assessing the influence of lineup administration procedures with the potential for improving the diagnosticity of CR identifications."

Although it is assumed that such multicultural education will foster harmonious relations among different ethnic groups at the university and in the broader society at large, this assumption has yet to be empirically tested in any rigorous manner. This project aims to achieve a process-oriented understanding of the ways in which a multicultural educational environment influences the development of intergroup attitudes and behaviors over the college years. Gaining a satisfactory understanding of the process by which the educational experience influences intergroup attitudes and behaviors would help answer the more general question of whether or not a multicultural educational experience actually increases or decreases intergroup tension. Several university experiences will be explored, including: a) the formal contents of course curricula; b) the informal and university sponsored extra-curricular activities; c) membership in various types of student organizations (e.g., fraternities, sororities, minority student organizations, and support groups); d) experience with conflict resolution programs; and e) dormitory living arrangements. Specific questions to be addressed include whether or not ""ethnic studies"" courses (e.g., African-American history) and membership in ""ethnic"" student organizations (e.g., African-American, Chinese-American student clubs) actually exacerbate or attenuate ethnic conflict and students' willingness to interact with people from other ethnic and racial groups.<br/><br/>These issues will be addressed by use of a longitudinal study of the freshman class admitted to UCLA in the fall of 1996 (approximately 2,000 students). The students have been interviewed once a year since their time of entry, and interviews will continue once a year until the students graduate (most of the students are expected to graduate in the spring of 2001). Measures were taken of students' baseline intergroup attitudes, behaviors, and expectations of the university environment before their entry into college (Summer 1996), and three additional waves of data concerning these attitudes, behaviors, and university activities have been collected.<br/><br/>Because of its high degree of ethnic diversity, the UCLA campus offers a unique opportunity to study the institutional factors that both facilitate and undermine the degree to which students engage in positive interactions with members of different ethnic groups.

Each of these processes will be examined within the context of the Programme d'Enseignement des Langues d'Origine, or PELO. This is a state-funded program designed to teach spoken ""heritage"" languages to children of immigrants and their descendants. By using a variety of ethnographic, linguistic, and historical methods, the student will investigate the ideological impact of one Tamil PELO program on the beliefs and linguistic practices of Tamil-speaking children and adults. <br/><br/>This project differs from other studies on Quebec's language issues because it directly examines how multilingualism, multicultural agendas, and nationalist policies have influenced Montreal residents' ideas about language. In doing so, this project will account for universal and culturally specific features of language in society. Furthermore, by investigating the salient differences in language use and ideology that result from the institutional mediation of Tamil citizenship, this project will contribute to a broader understanding of transnational subjects. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In addition to contributing to the doctoral education of a linguistic anthropologist, this project will further our understanding of language use and ideology as integral components of teaching and national policy-making. The collaboration with teachers, administrators, and school commission officials throughout the research process will foster new interactions between the academic research institution, educational institutions, and the government."

The current proposal seeks to develop a more elaborate skilled perceptual-memory account of the CRE that is grounded broadly in the cognitive skill acquisition literature. The intellectual merit of the proposal is aimed towards advancing our theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, and bridging the findings of such a framework to field investigators and eyewitnesses in multicultural communities. Given the over-representation of minorities in the U.S. prison system, yet their under-representation in the law enforcement community, each of the proposed studies will focus upon the participation of Hispanic and Black individuals. Florida International University, located in Miami, Florida, provides a unique multicultural setting for exploring this phenomenon. Thus, the broader impacts of the proposal involve improving the discrimination and identification of CR faces for field investigators working in such multicultural communities or in other countries, and reducing the fallibility of eyewitness evidence leading to the wrongful conviction of these minority populations. The first three studies in the proposal are designed to address remaining issues of theoretical interest, including the assessment of early perceptual processes in the CRE. In Study 1, the variation in research exploring the expertise-based ""inversion effect"" within the CR domain will be assessed, and a paradigm will be proposed to validate predictions based upon a skilled perceptual-memory framework. Study 2 will explore several aspects of expert-novice performance differences that have received little attention in the CR domain, including (a) perceptual identification, (b) short-term memory span, and (c) ""speedup"" in recognition performance. Recent research on ""change blindness"" has provided a paradigm for exploring attentional and metacognitive effects of perception, including expert-novice differences, and Study 3 will explore such effects in the perception of own- and other-race faces. The final three studies are designed to examine the potential application of a skilled memory framework of the CRE. Given recent national events and the over-representation of minorities in the criminal justice system, of critical necessity is the development of a training program that can be administered to field investigators working in local multicultural communities or in other countries. A 2-week intervention will be tested in Study 4 involving a novel computer-based discrimination and memory task. Study 5 will attempt to extend previous research on the construction and assessment of own- and other-race photograph lineups, while Study 6 will introduce a novel paradigm for assessing the influence of lineup administration procedures with the potential for improving the diagnosticity of CR identifications."

It compares how the movements invoke their identity to justify demands for land, territory, and political autonomy -- rights that are crucial to indigenous citizenship and that, when granted, can dramatically alter power relations and the locus of state authority. Bolivia's indigenous movement politicizes its identity to justify demands for ""territory"" and ""autonomy""; their Guatemalan counterparts, by contrast, demand land redistribution and focus on building ""local power"" within community government. In both countries, indigenous people are a historically marginalized and racialized majority, and the challenge of including them as full citizens of the state is tremendous. Why do the Bolivian and Guatemalan indigenous movements respond to this challenge in such different ways, and how can we explain their differing demands? I propose that political opportunities and institutions interact with indigenous identity to produce the different demands -- and different politicizations of identity -- in the Bolivian and Guatemalan movements. Using data from semi-structured interviews, observations, and documents, I will reconstruct the processes of demand-making through the local and national level experiences of major indigenous social movement organizations in each country. The findings will contribute to theory on social movements and identity politics, and will reveal the socio-political factors that lead to very different ways of reconfiguring citizenship in multi-ethnic and racially polarized democracies. Additionally, the results of the study will carry important practical implications by investigating indigenous movement agency in influencing multicultural rights policies, which are debated in both national and international arenas."

However, at this time Muslim immigrants from diverse cultures are creating multi-cultural ethnic, national and linguistic religious communities in the US. The Muslim religion is this nation's fastest growing religion. This dissertation research project by a student of cultural anthropology studies the process of creating a religious community where adaptation and similarities of belief and custom are emphasized over significant differences. The research will be conducted in the Islamic Society of Vermont, in northern Vermont, where immigrants from the Middle East, Bosnia-Herzegovina, India/Pakistan, Southeast Asia, North America and elsewhere are creating a Muslim center. Using ethnographic techniques of participant observation and structured in-depth interviews the student will examine how immigrants manage their significant internal differences in order to construct a cohesive religious community. Focusing on religious law, parenting strategies, community leadership and conflict management, the student will examine how a uniquely American vision of Islam is being created. The results of the study will be valuable to society at large, as a corrective to the prevalent image. In addition the new information will be valuable to policy makers dealing with immigration from Muslim regions. The project also contributes to the training of a young social scientist."

For each of the three years, research projects will be organized around a central research stream: 1) ""Memory, monuments, and commemoration,"" 2) ""Multicultural heritage in Europe"" and 3) ""Producing localities."" By developing their projects in relation to a central set of research questions, students will contribute to three key areas of inquiry for global, comparative investigation of cultural heritage as a site of contestation, conflict, and cohesion. Anthropol-ogists have critically engaged the concepts of culture and heritage for decades, but the rise of the field of heritage management offers new opportunities for ethnographic investigation of how core disciplinary concepts are used by policymakers, citizens, and other social actors. The proposed program provides an integrative framework for an ethnographic field school that will draw the participation of students across the four subfields of anthropology and serve as a model for interdisciplinary teambuilding in applied heritage anthropology. <br/><br/>Government institutions face new demands to develop public programming that reflects our nation's diverse, multicultural heritage, and there is a growing need for social scientists trained in applied heritage anthropology and related fields. Broader impacts of this project include: 1) training a diverse group of US students for international, comparative anthropological research on cultural heritage policies in multicul-tural, democratic societies; 2) developing scientific networks between anthropologists in the US and Spain that will form the basis for further international sponsored research; and 3) collaborating with faculty and students from Spain to produce a body of systematic, comparative research publications available to the public through an online project hub.

Mergers between galaxies of different mass are very common in the universe and may affect the majority of galaxies including our own Milky Way galaxy. The debris produced in these minor mergers is a unique place to study the factors that influence star formation since it is away from the dense centers of the mergers. Due to the lower pressures and densities in the tidal debris, this study probes the lower bounds of where star formation is possible. To attract a diverse workforce in science and engineering, a new astronomy outreach initiative, Multicultural Milky Way, will engage under-served populations in Arizona in learning about our Milky Way and other galaxies. Arizona is home to many diverse populations with rich cultural histories such as Mayan, Navajo, and Apache. Linking astronomy practiced by one's indigenous culture to that of Western astronomy may increase the interest in science. Through multicultural planetarium shows and associated hands-on activities, under-served families will learn how the Milky Way is represented in different cultures and about the science of galaxies. <br/><br/>This project will characterize how star formation occurs in tidal debris and the origin of the debris. Narrowband infrared images of molecular hydrogen will provide a picture of the hot molecular gas component and how the interstellar medium of the tail has been molded by in-situ star formation. This project will provide the first survey of molecular hydrogen in minor mergers. With optical, H-alpha, and submillimeter observations, these data will give a more complete picture of star formation in tidal debris of minor mergers. Using the metallicity calculated from spectra of tidal clumps in minor mergers compared to regions in the parent spiral and dwarf galaxy, the origin of the tidal debris of minor mergers can be determined: the cannibalized dwarf, the outer regions of the spiral, or the center. In addition, a new astronomy outreach initiative, Multicultural Milky Way, will engage under-served populations in Arizona in learning about stars and galaxies. New shows featuring how different cultures view the Milky Way will be created for the Digistar static and STARLAB portable planetariums. STARLAB shows and associated new hands-on activities will feature at Community Astronomy Nights around Arizona. For authentic assessment, evaluation techniques and procedures will be developed with education mentors."

The effects of increased social interaction and of changing social and legal contexts on perceptions of and memory for individuals of other groups is a topic of perennial scholarly interest. The accuracy of cross- racial eyewitness identification is an important area of concern; yet, there is no consensus in the scholarly community about the psychological mechanisms which affect these judgments. This is an area in which there are interesting theoretical developments that have implications for both formal and informal interactions among people of different groups. This project is for a planning grant to facilitate development of a research project that will assess factors associated with global changes in racism, discrimination, and ethnic conflict. The project being planned will focus, in particular, on the effects of social structure, social experience, and attitudes on cross-racial identification in the Republic of South Africa as the legal system of apartheid or ""separateness"" is dismantled. At the core of the approach is the notion that the relative heterogeneity of the social resources afforded by a particular group will determine the ability of individuals to differentiate on the basis of facial and other appearance. The more homogeneously another race is viewed in social terms, the less likelihood of individual recognition. During this planning period the investigators will (1) establish a multi-national, multi-discipline, multi-racial research team that will participate in the research; (2) travel to South Africa to discuss research plans and study materials; and (3) develop a comprehensive plan for the subsequent research. This research addresses an important dimension of racial and social conflict and has specific implications for cross-racial eyewitness identification and reliability. The results of the study will enable revising existing theory to accommodate multicultural dimensions of racial bias. The research will also contribute to our understanding of broader issues of social perception."

During the second quarter, students will take a Scientific Communication course and two additional courses covering various marine science topics. Broader Impacts: Results from prior funding indicate that this program is highly successful in efforts to encourage students to pursue advanced degrees in science. Of the 155 participants who have completed their undergraduate degrees, 15% have pursued the doctorate; 44%, the Master's degree. Overall, 68% have pursued advanced education. Alumni contributions to the sciences include over 381 presentations at science conferences (49 best student paper awards) and co-authorship on over 112 publications in the refereed scientific literature. The impact of these alumni as role models for their peers will multiply the effects of the program. Training and mentoring approaches will continue to be shared nationally, and alumni will continue to participate in other ocean science programs. MIMSUP students are trained in and participate in K-12 marine science lessons in the local school system and in providing ocean science outreach activities at local festivals serving a general audience."

The research objective of this award is to consider how people manage their attention in multi-cultural collaborations between geographically distributed individuals. ?Virtual organizations??aggregations of individuals, facilities and resources that span geographic and institutional boundaries?allow large numbers of people to collaborate across geographic, temporal and cultural barriers to achieve important societal goals. Despite the advantages of virtual organizations, it can be difficult for people to work effectively together at a distance. Most virtual organizations include communication tools, such as instant messaging, email, and even real time video conferencing. But because virtual organization members lack awareness of who is around and whether or not they are busy, they can?t use these tools effectively to coordinate their work with colleagues. <br/><br/>This award considers the issue of managing attention in virtual organizations in which people must collaborate with a culturally heterogeneous set of remote partners. The work addresses three critical issues for the support of awareness information in these organizations: 1) How do people assess others? availability, and what cues to availability do they themselves wish to provide others? 2) How can these processes be supported in awareness tools, both for desktop use and for use in mobile environments? And 3) how can these processes be supported in a way that tools will be accepted by the diverse membership of global organizations? These questions are addressed through a combination of tool development, survey and interview research, and controlled laboratory studies. <br/><br/>This work builds on substantial research in the area of interpersonal awareness and fostering informal interaction in geographically distributed groups and on awareness and attention in distributed groups. The work provides four unique contributions: (a) integrating empirical behavioral research with technology design and implementation, such that technology and theory inform each other directly; (b) understanding and harnessing culturally appropriate attentional behaviors in distributed groups to enhance our understanding of human behavior; (c) building and evaluating novel technologies for interaction in geographically distributed groups; and (d) considering how awareness and attention tools can meet the needs of a culturally diverse workforce. The work will lead to new theories and tools that will improve collaboration in virtual organizations of all types."

Modern citizenship denotes membership in a political community and the rights and responsibilities attached to that membership. It also denotes membership in a national community defined by cultural norms, values, and ethnocultural markers. Those deemed unassimilable in the national community often lack full, substantive access to the rights and privileges enjoyed by dominant groups. Thus, universalistic conceptions of citizenship exist in tension, to varying degrees, with the de facto marginalization or exclusion of particular groups. Estonia has seen growing social and political divisions between the ethnic Estonian majority and the large Russian minority since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. With its accession to the European Union in 2004, Estonia expressed its commitment to Europe's post-national political project. In practice, however, the EU's directives regarding multiculturalism and minority rights have coexisted uneasily with Estonia's post-Soviet nation-building prerogatives. This project will study the politics of citizenship in Estonia from the perspective of secondary school students in Tallinn, Estonia's largest and most ethnically mixed city. Schools traditionally are key sites of citizenship formation, and the doctoral student will explore how educators and administrators as well as EU youth-policy makers articulate and implement particular citizenship ideals and national narratives through school curricula. She will explore how current secondary school students (part of the first wholly post-Soviet generation in Estonia) interpret, respond to, and act upon the citizenship narratives that they learn in school as well as how their experiences within and outside of school inform their understandings of citizenship and belonging in Estonia. To explore these issues, she will conduct focus groups with students in seven secondary schools, including schools that are predominantly Estonian, that are predominantly Russian, and that have mixed ethnicity. Focus group participants will participate in mapping exercises and a walking tour of Tallinn's controversial memorial sites and monuments, the purpose of which is to explore how young people's understandings of citizenship and their sense of belonging are informed by, and shaped within, material spaces within and beyond the school.<br/><br/>The results of this research will enhance basic understanding of citizenship as sets of political discourses, policies, and practices that people encounter in their everyday lives. This research will demonstrate how citizenship, while often conceived of in universalistic terms, has uneven meanings or outcomes, both spatially and socially. The project will shed new light on the role of young people as political actors, illuminating the ways they engage in the politics of citizenship even as they may be excluded from formal modes of political participation. In doing so, the project will bring together the fields of youth geography and civic education, and it will help focus attention on schools as key sites of citizenship formation and negotiation. This project also will contribute to current discussions about ethnonational politics in the former Soviet Union and will help clarify tensions between EU norms and nation-building projects in post-communist states. Project results will help inform discussions about divided societies, providing important insights into the role of youth and education policies in addressing ethnonational tensions in divided societies. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

Therefore, it is imperative<br/>that preservice teachers are offered better opportunities to connect what<br/>they learn in the university context to the school context. This issue is<br/>even more urgent in science education when one considers the calls for<br/>finding effective ways to prepare secondary science teachers to meet the<br/>needs of an increasingly diverse pupil population.<br/> Hence, the study proposed here seeks to explore the following<br/>research questions:<br/><br/>1. What are the difficulties cooperating and preservice teachers encounter<br/>while trying to implement a sociotransformative constructivist orientation<br/>in diverse middle school classrooms (i.e., an orientation that intersects<br/>inquiry-based science teaching with sociocultural constructivism and<br/>multicultural education)?<br/>2. In what ways does a sociotransformative constructivist orientation to<br/>teaching enhance cooperating and preservice teachers' abilities to teach<br/>science for diversity and for understanding?<br/>3. In what ways does a sociotransformative constructivist orientation to<br/>teaching enhance pupils' attitudes toward and academic performance in<br/>science?<br/> To explore these research questions, a three-year longitudinal<br/>study will be conducted, and will include three parts. The first part<br/>consists of a two-week summer institute for twenty middle school teachers.<br/>The hands-on and minds-on activities offered at the institute will be used<br/>to illustrate how a sociotransformative constructivist orientation can be<br/>implemented in the classroom. The principal investigator and two master<br/>teachers (from the local area) will offer instruction. The second part of<br/>the project will consist of pairing preservice teachers with the teachers<br/>who participated in the summer workshop. By this time, the preservice<br/>teachers would have completed a required science methods class based on the<br/>same theoretical frameworks that guided the summer institute. The third<br/>part of the project will consist of a follow-up study of the preservice<br/>teachers after they graduate and secure teaching jobs. The new graduates<br/>will be followed up for the first two years of teaching. Two summer<br/>conferences will be held with cooperating and novice teachers to strengthen<br/>the on-going efforts for mentorship and professional development.<br/> Data for all stages of the study will be analyzed using an<br/>ethnographic approach. Thus, cooperating and preservice science teachers<br/>and a focus group of their pupils will be visited regularly by the research<br/>team, and on-going in-depth interviews and classroom observations will be<br/>conducted. Some lessons will be videotaped and a variety of teacher- and<br/>student-produced work will be gathered to add more context and<br/>opportunities to contrast emerging themes and categories.<br/> The results of this study should enrich our understanding of how to<br/>effectively prepare science teachers to teach for understanding in<br/>increasingly diverse schools. Similarly, this study will add insights on<br/>how to enhance the academic performance and attitude toward science of<br/>diverse middle school pupils."

In response, the State Board of Regents has developed an Engineering and Computer Science Initiative within the state system of higher education with intentions to double the number of graduates in engineering and related technology majors by the year 2006. The faculty within the College of Engineering believe that efforts to improve retention, and to increase enrollment opportunities for students from underrepresented minorities, will contribute significantly toward that goal. Central to this effort is an increase in the number of scholarship opportunities available to engineering students within each of the 5 departments in the College of Engineering. For each year of the four year duration of this project, 30 need-based scholarships at $3,125 each are being awarded. The scholarships allow students to spend more time on academic pursuits, and less time employed outside the University. Scholarship recipients must: 1) be U.S. citizens, 2) enroll full time within the College of Engineering, 3) demonstrate financial need as defined by the U.S. Department of Education rules for Federal Financial aid, and 4) show academic potential or ability. Recruitment is done through the USU Office of High School/College Relations, the Multicultural Student Center, and the College of Engineering. In addition to traditional recruiting methods, the college recruits through its annual Engineering State program, a four day event held each spring in which approximately 250 high school juniors from throughout the State of Utah are introduced to the opportunities available in the various fields of engineering. In addition to scholarship opportunities, the program also provides CSEMS scholars with: 1) a formal program through which they can receive academic assistance and advising, 2) a mechanism to promote interaction with upper-division students and faculty on a regular basis, 3) research opportunities with faculty mentors, and 4) early access to co-op/internship opportunities and industry mentors.

Within social psychology, the Common In-group Identity Model (CIIM) is well established as one of the central organizing frameworks for understanding intergroup relationships. The proposed research examines the CIIM in order to understand when and why a dual identity will serve to decrease or increase intergroup bias and conflict. The research project includes nine experimental laboratory and field studies to be conducted at 3 different institutions. Taken together, the studies examine the following four potential moderating factors that may explain the inconsistent effects of dual identity obtained in previous research: (a) minority/majority group status; (b) domain of subgroup and subordinate group identity; (c) threat to original group identity implied by different integration patterns; and (d) anticipated context (i.e., harmonious or contentious) of intergroup relations. Importantly, this research will be conducted from the different perspectives of racial majority and minority group students attending the University of Delaware and the University of Connecticut (where a large majority of undergraduate students are white) and Delaware State University (an historically Black college where a majority of undergraduate students are African American). Doing this enables the researchers to study the effects of numerical and broader cultural conceptions of majority and minority status on representations and bias. This research has as many important practical implications as theoretical benefits. For example, the research has the potential to demonstrate that, because majority and minority groups have different perspectives, and possess different integration ideologies (e.g., assimilationist or multi-cultural), effective interventions to reduce intergroup bias and conflict (e.g., in educational settings) need to consider these different orientations. Improving intergroup relations requires a consideration of both perspectives. Perhaps even more importantly, the implications of this research extend well beyond the scope of social psychology and can contribute to current debates about whether assimilationist or multicultural strategies are most effective at fostering harmonious relations between groups. Indeed, this research can suggest when and explain why each of these integration patterns may be especially effective for producing harmonious intergroup relations."

The project title is ""The Role of the Serotonin Transporter Gene and Cultural Tightness-Looseness in Social Perception and Cooperation."" The host scientist is Dr. Ying Yi Hong.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to examine how individual variability in genes that regulate affective processing may interact with one's cultural environment to facilitate or hinder cooperation with ingroup and outgroup members. Specifically, we study how tightness-looseness (TL)--a cultural dimension measuring the strength of social norms and tolerance of deviance--and the serotonin transporter gene influence interpersonal cooperation. Due to the influence of TL on norm abidance and outgroup perceptions, the role of the serotonin transporter gene on threat sensitivity, and research showing that TL and the serotonin transporter gene have evolved in tandem across geography, investigating the dual influence of these factors on a risky undertaking, such as cooperation with outgroup members, sheds light on the complexities that underlie prosocial behavior. Specific to this project, the majority of peer-reviewed studies examining neural and genetic variation come from Western, industrialized nations and do not acknowledge the influence of cultural values on the relation between human brain function and behavior (Chiao, 2009). Hence, the present research aims to address the external validity of both psychological intergroup processes and behavioral genetic paradigms. Additionally, Singaporeans are an underrepresented population in research, so this project will broaden participation in science while illuminating an unexplored gene-environment interaction in two distinct cultures: the United States and Singapore.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, another primary goal of this research is to equip the Fellow with a deeper understanding of the factors that influence prosociality to aid in the preparation of a nuanced intervention-training program to cultivate cooperation. Finally, this research has the potential to be an intellectual bridge between scientific advancement in the Social, Affective, Cultural Neuroscience Lab at Northwestern University and the Multicultural Identity and Processes Lab the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Both of these labs value the dual influence of biology and culture on interpersonal behavior, and this advantageous collaboration will foster future cross-cultural work in the fields of behavioral genetics, social psychology, and cultural neuroscience."

In the career exploration phase of the study, young women who are academically-able but not already interested in engineering will be encouraged to direct and document their own approach to what they learn about engineering. By encouraging the women's own career explorations and reflections, and using current and appropriate-for-youth communication technologies, the PIs intend to elicit their ""authentic"" perspectives on engineering as a field of study and a career choice. This approach is different from much current research that documents young women's lack of interest and participation in engineering but does not directly investigate how young women see and perceive the profession while they explore its career potential. In addition, the study will contribute valuable information to the career development literature by identifying features and themes of young women's attitudes and decision-making about engineering as a career option. Moreover, by examining diverse young women's own views over time, this research will provide a deeper and richer understanding of gender, youth, and multicultural standpoints in relation to the engineering profession.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>On a broad national scale, this study seeks to discover and describe the career exploration experiences of a diverse population of young women.

Dissemination of the findings will be through higher education, business communities, and professional societies, catalyzing deeper sensitivity toward those underrepresented in the engineering ranks. This will be accomplished primarily through presentations at professional association conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals and popular press venues, and web sites."

We pay special attention to female innovators and scientists to provide positive, ""technological"" female role models to help encourage girls to explore the sciences while advancing creative thinking, problem solving, and originality.<br/> We hope this project will increase time girls spend with the computer, increase their comfort level with technology, improve their learning by contextualizing concepts and problem solving, and provide characters engaged in science, math, and technology in order to promote scientific concepts and the associated disciplines.<br/> Josie will be promoted with textbook publishers, national school boards, and international education organizations. In addition, as an internet-based activity, Josie True will be accessible wherever the Internet is, such as public libraries and some schools."

Not all women have the same experiences in science education, however. Asian Americans have high levels of education and socio-economic status, even relative to Whites. Educational paths in science are often seen by Asian Americans as good options given their objective criteria and high social returns. Among Asian Americans, both men and women are heavily represented in the sciences. Thus the image of the ""model minority"" does apply to Asian Americans in the science education system. But Asian Americans are not a monolithic group. The major focus of this research is on the complex ways in which race and gender come together to influence Asian American women's experiences in science education.<br/><br/>Although the gender gap in science participation is smaller in the Asian American student population than in the White population, it is important to note that it still exists. Asian American women are virtually invisible in the social science literature. Simplistic stereotypes about submissive, subservient Asian American women and notions of Asian<br/>Americans as the model minority have worked to limit careful research on Asian American women in science. This study will explore the STEM education experiences of young Asian American women using both mature (National Educational Longitudinal Survey) and new (web-based survey that includes vignettes) data collection technologies to test hypotheses about how race, gender, and Asian American culture come together to influence the science experiences of young Asian American women.<br/><br/>The project's intellectual merit includes the use of innovative methods that promise to provide new approaches to data collection and survey techniques. The conceptual framework used to examine young Asian American women's (and men's) experiences in science integrates critical gender theory (which acknowledges gender as a powerful macro structure that hierarchically organizes society but which also acknowledges gender as a source of agency) and a multi-cultural approach (which stresses the diversity in these structures and the unique gender and family systems in minority cultures). The study will provide information on science experiences, perceptions of science abilities, and sources of encouragement and discouragement for Asian American women at various points in the STEM education system (from 8th grade through the post-secondary school years).<br/><br/>The broader impact of this research will advance knowledge in the area of science talent development beyond simplistic notions of race and gender that do not acknowledge the complex ways in which race and gender interact and do not focus on diversity and complexity within the ""model minority"" Asian American subculture. The research will draw attention to a little studied population. Additionally, it will reveal potential agency in understudied groups and the ways in which immigrant communities invest in their children's (male and female) education. These issues have implications for how science is taught, how minority students' talents are perceived, and how other programs and STEM interventions could integrate multi-cultural issues into programs and policies."

The collaborative three-year study, using participatory action methodology, qualitative methods, and quantitative measures, will ""seed"" the women's explorations of engineering as a career and then examine how racially, socio-economically, and geographically diverse young high school women come to know the profession of engineering. It aims to analyze the young women's career exploration journey, the influences that shape their sense of the profession, and their views and feelings about their career options in engineering at the conclusion of the exploration experience and beyond. The study will include 120 diverse (African American, Latina, American Indian, and Euro-American) participants in 3 states and 11 sites.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>The study offers a new perspective and innovative methodology to address the question, why are there so few women, including women of color, in engineering and how might this imbalance be lessened? In the career exploration phase of the study, young women who are academically-able but not already interested in engineering will be encouraged to direct and document their own approach to what they learn about engineering. By encouraging the women's own career explorations and reflections, and using current and appropriate-for-youth communication technologies, the PIs intend to elicit their ""authentic"" perspectives on engineering as a field of study and a career choice. This approach is different from much current research that documents young women's lack of interest and participation in engineering but does not directly investigate how young women see and perceive the profession while they explore its career potential. In addition, the study will contribute valuable information to the career development literature by identifying features and themes of young women's attitudes and decision-making about engineering as a career option. Moreover, by examining diverse young women's own views over time, this research will provide a deeper and richer understanding of gender, youth, and multicultural standpoints in relation to the engineering profession.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>On a broad national scale, this study seeks to discover and describe the career exploration experiences of a diverse population of young women. It also seeks to examine the reasons for the disinterest in engineering of young women as they consider future career options. The study aims to provide knowledge to expand the engineering workforce as well as to support diversity and multicultural initiatives currently underway in academia and industry. Dissemination of the findings will be through higher education, business communities, and professional societies, catalyzing deeper sensitivity toward those underrepresented in the engineering ranks. This will be accomplished primarily through presentations at professional association conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals and popular press venues, and web sites."

The goal of this project is to gather new insights into the ways people organize and understand their worlds within and across different cultures by means of innovative methodologies and tools from the fields of psychology and computational linguistics. The findings from this project will provide a better understanding of people on the individual psychological level as well as the cultures themselves, while developing and demonstrating new research techniques that can be used in future by many disciplines to exploit the vast troves of scientifically valuable textual data currently available online. Specifically, the project targets the following three main research objectives: 1) Construct a very large multicultural database of writings from English-speaking cultures, covering several styles and genres, including: social media (e.g., blogs, tweets); news articles; literary works; student writings. 2) Build computational linguistic models that can automatically identify differences in concept usage for different cultures, and apply these models on a large scale. 3) Validate the findings of these computational models through psychological qualitative and quantitative methods in laboratory studies. <br/><br/>The ways people use words can provide insights into the ways they see and understand their worlds. Everyday language can also tell us about people's social, emotional, and psychological states and even the ways they think about themselves and others. Particularly interesting is that many of the social and psychological insights we find with the language of individuals can be extrapolated to groups, communities, and entire cultures. This project seeks to analyze the written language of people across several cultures in a way that will allow us to better understand the ways groups of people understand their worlds. In short, it will use advances in computational linguistics and social psychology to track the underlying values, beliefs, and concerns of very large groups of people by analyzing the ways they use words. Unlike previous studies, which have been limited to relatively small self-report surveys targeting a handful of concepts across cultures, this project will help us understand the differences in perception for thousands of concepts, by several cultures representing hundreds of thousands of people.<br/><br/>This project promises to shed new light on cultural differences by analyzing the ways people understand their worlds through their everyday language use. The approach will inform applications in communication, threat control, tracking of cultural values, and others. The project will also provide educational opportunities, in the form of training for students in both computer science and psychology, who will be directly exposed to interdisciplinary research, cultural diversity, and international experiences. Finally, the large multicultural dataset that will be created as part of this project, along with the tools to process it, will be made publicly available, thus enabling future research, as well as educational projects concerned with the analysis and understanding of cultural diversity and worldview."

Science teachers from the Madison and Milwaukee school districts will meet in Madison with Institute staff and faculty for four weeks during the summer to develop instruction in three areas that are predicted to enhance the science classroom environment for minority students. The Institute is designed to foster changes in teachers' attitudes (toward minorities, role of teachers, organization of classroom), and empower the teachers to develop the skills necessary to put those attitudes into practice. The three areas in which teachers will work are: (1) developing greater understanding of the strengths and needs of minority students; and investigating the applicability of (2) the cooperative learning approach and (3) the problem solving approach to enrichment of multicultural science classrooms. Throughout the Institute, teachers will themselves learn in the cooperative learning/problem solving mode, with continuing attention to the needs of minority students. The major task will be to develop new instructional units for teaching their science classes the following year utilizing those modes. Cost sharing is equivalent to 52% of the NSF award."

In addition to providing a means for teachers and communities, particularly those with traditionally under-represented groups, to share their own scientific ""funds of knowledge"" (Moll, 1993), other currently undigitized resources also will become available to schools. For example, The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History will contribute historical, scientific and cultural resources from its highly acclaimed The Seeds of Change program; and New Mexico State University will contribute scientific results and video clips from its experiment station and video productions (such as Survivors in the Sand). The project will build on other work already underway, such as The Desert Classroom, a laserdisc and instructional materials developed with teachers through New Mexico SIMSE (NSF-funded Systemic Initiative in Science and Mathematics Education); and Los Ninos y La Tierra (The Children and the Earth), with cultural and gardening resources from small villages in Northern New Mexico gathered by a non-profit group to support cultural traditions in science education. Collaboration will be the key method employed, meaning teachers will work with, not for, university and museum multimedia developers and educators to create exciting resources and spaces for learning science, including well-developed models, accessible through this digital library. The Objectives can be summarized as: 1) creating top-quality electronic library resources through collaboration among diverse students and teachers, with nationally recognized specialists in information, multimedia, video, science, and education; 2) creating digital and real-world environments for asynchronous and synchrono us learning across time, location and cultures; 3) modeling adaptation of exemplary curricula with local, real-world learning in multicultural classrooms through the power of digital technologies; 4) distributing both the library resources and successful development and implementation models; and 5) institutionalizing the Digital Desert Library, the developmental process, and the implementation strategies to ensure sustainability. The numerous expected outcomes focus on both creating an outstanding digital library of resources from scientific and multicultural communities, and also on modeling a process for integration of these products into meaningful learning. The DDL, its development process and implementation strategies will be institutionalized within the Smithsonian's Natural Partners Initiative, the systemic change initiative programs, and NMSU's Extension and 4-H programs to ensure sustainability and expansion of the processes after this funding is completed. ***"

In addition, with the Federal mandate of ""no child left behind"" an increasing national priority is learning objectives that prepare students to do well on national standardized tests, and many of these learning objectives rely on literacy skills. Yet literacy remains a critical unsolved issue in our educational system, with national test scores showing that non-white children (e.g., African Americans and Hispanics) still score well below their Caucasian counterparts. Increasingly, approaches to this problem derive from the recognition that primary school education is based on a set of mainstream oral practices and literacy-preparation skills. Because many children do not share the same cultural experiences typical of mainstream culture, educational practitioners have applied a cultural-historical approach to identify common characteristics of ethnic groups, and then designed cultural supports for literacy learning by children of diverse backgrounds. But while classroom practice has been influenced by this approach, and training programs for parents have been instituted along these lines, it has been rare to see technological learning environments that leverage diversity in any but the most superficial ways (for example identical content characters with different skin color, or content based on traditional associations such as the Anancy myths). The PI believes she can do much better. To this end, in the current project she will first conduct an in-depth investigation into African-American peer-oriented oral language and literacy practices, in order to understand how cultural practices support individual learning and development in this population. Using these findings, she will then design a virtual peer that engages in authentic cultural practices with African-American children as a bridge to school-based literacy. As the technology is developed, the PI will bring it into classrooms and community centers, formatively evaluating and iteratively redesigning as necessary until the virtual peer is capable of being like African-American children in important ways, can exploit that affinity to establish rapport, and can leverage this rapport and linguistic interaction to help the child acquire literacy skills. Project outcomes will include a rich comparative description of the language and nonverbal practices of African-American and Caucasian children in peer-emergent literacy interaction, a set of behaviors that allow a virtual human to establish rapport with users (including local-level moment-by-moment interactional behaviors and larger scale culturally specific practices), and a Flash virtual peer and set of virtual peer behaviors that have been shown to improve literacy in the children interacting with the virtual peer, both for Standard American English (SAE) speakers and African American Vernacular English (AAVE) speakers. A summative evaluation will address transfer from interaction with the virtual peer to other standard literacy contexts and tests. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project addresses fundamental issues relating to acquisition of literacy skills by young children who are members of an underserved population, and will lead to new technology for improving their literacy readiness. The PI will pursue an innovative program of dissemination of results and research practices that involves undergraduates from HBCUs, local schools with high populations of African Americans, and local churches and community centers, in order to broaden in the short term participation by African-American undergraduates in the engineering research behind this project and in the longer term participation in STEM by young African-American school children."

This research project addresses cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary perspectives of faculty and graduate students on ethical issues relevant to the graduate education of scientists and engineers. The research team, composed of an engineer, a philosopher and a psychologist, is qualitatively assessing the delivery of the research in the classroom by focusing on several questions: Can cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary perspectives be readily discovered in individuals? If so, How? Can they be brought together with ethical theories into a coherent and justifiable whole? If so, How? Can that whole be applied to the ethical decision making of individuals seeking to function harmoniously in multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary communities? If so, How? These research questions are being examined with five objectives. First is the three-year research objective to produce study modules each consisting of an ethical topic in either science or engineering (S&E), cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary perspectives of individuals on that topic, and a systematic arrangement of each individual perspective and that topic into a prescription for behavior that can be accommodated in multi-cultural, multi-disciplinary, US communities. Second is the three-year research and education objective to conduct a seminar series bringing external experts to the project and culminating at the end of the third year in a major national symposium. Third is the educational objective to conduct workshops in the second year on modules for lecturers in ethics to graduate students. Fourth is the educational objective in the third year to observe as lecturers deliver modules to graduate students. Fifth is the publication of all modules in a textbook for the ethics instruction of S&E graduate students. The chief activity of this project is the development of a narrative approach to the first objective. This approach combines previous works published by the three principal participants of this project on (1) the uses by psychologists of auto-biographies to discover African American ethnic factors of self-identity, (2) the uses of mythic stories to discover heroes in one's own family or ancestry identified as African American engineers judged, by reference to African experiences, worthy of imitation in Western ethical situations, and (3) the comparison of African and Western ethics and the accommodation of African ethics to Western values. This project will extend these works to include Asian, Indian, Hispanic and other perspectives, and to adapt them to ethical problems in S&E. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is in the development of a coherent arrangement of a narrative theory of personality, the mythic story, and comparative ethics, and in the application of that arrangement to practical problems in science and engineering. This is a novel activity promising to enhance the ethical decision making skills of individual scientists and engineers without requiring them to become specialist experts on ethical theory and argumentation. Rather, compensation for this specialty is made on the presumption that most of them are already generalist experts on believable stories. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity will be on the globalization process and the fitness of the US participatory democracy to govern its technological society. The cross-cultural empowerment promised by this project to scientists and engineers will ready them for the challenges of globalization, and the cross-disciplinary empowerment promised by it will ready them for effective leadership in academia, the professional, governmental, and business sectors of society, and in the decision making venues open to citizens, experts and non-experts in technological democracies."

These school districts are located in Brooklyn, and include Bedford-Stuyvesant and other high minority and low income areas. This project would train more than half of the 1,000 teachers in the 25 elementary schools in these districts in constructivist inquiry-based approaches to interdisciplinary science teaching. The intent of this comprehensive district-wide effort is to create a ""seamless"" day in which science forms an integral part of instruction in all subject areas. Education and science faculty from Brooklyn College would act as resources in the project, and staff trainers from Lawrence Hall of Science and other curriculum developers would instruct teacher trainers in several exemplary hands on curricula. Teachers, principals, and school administrators will receive hands on training. In addition, exemplary teachers will receive additional training that will prepare them to act as mentors for pre-service teachers from Brooklyn College. The project includes several other extensions, such as a summer science camp, a materials support center, and supervisory training. This comprehensive approach to science instruction can have significant and lasting impact in the classrooms of these underserved school districts. Science will become a vehicle for teaching reading, language arts, music, social studies, and all other subjects. Math instruction will use data gathered by the students during their science activities, thereby reinforcing the relationships among subject areas. This integration of subject areas will be modelled through an internship program for teachers in training at Brooklyn College, making this a systemic and potentially permanent change in science teaching in Brooklyn.

In the early part of the three year project, curriculum is highlighted: (1) Quantitative thinking is being developed as a systemic strand through science courses; this involves the use of lab-based science instruction as a way of teaching mathematics, and using mathematics as a way of allowing active learning to extend beyond the bounds of lab and human scales. This project addresses the science and science education courses. The PI's are cooperating with colleagues concurrently working on revision of the mathematics sequence for elementary education majors. (2) Since teaching in the constructivist mode involves a major shift for most faculty, the PI's are working to enhance consistency in teaching throughout the science courses. (3) The science faculty are developing a revised model for set-up of laboratory work, to allow for flexibility and spontaneity in student activities. In the latter part of the grant period, the PI's will prepare a book about their experiences in devising a constructivist curriculum, including discussion of pedagogical, scientific, philosophical, and political issues. In addition to curricular illustrations, the book will demonstrate how faculty with traditional backgrounds can be encouraged, motivated, and taught to develop teaching style s appropriate to inquiry-based learning."

However, they also know that the reasons for this are complex, seem to vary by cultural group, and are shaped by global as well as local processes. The goal of this research project is to see if increased multicultural contact, such as that brought about by economic and cultural globalization, affects student STEM achievement and success. Drawing on an interdisciplinary suite of theories and methods, Dr. Rosalyn Negron and Dr. Adan Colon-Carmona, both of the University of Massachusetts Boston, will undertake research to refine the conceptualization and measurement of multiculturalism, and examine specific interactions between multiculturalism and STEM skills as correlates of STEM success. The researchers hypothesize that multiculturalism will be associated with key STEM skills, and that under-represented minority students who persist in STEM studies beyond the first academic year will be more likely to be multicultural than students who drop out of STEM studies.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted in the College of Sciences and Mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Boston, a minority serving institution. The researchers and a team of graduate and undergraduate assistants will recruit STEM students who self-identity as belonging to one of the university's underrepresented minority categories (American Indian/Alaskan Native, African American/Black, Hispanic/Latin, Cape Verdean, Hawaiian Native/Pacific Islander, and Southeast Asian). They will administer standard scales and conduct life history and social network interviews with a small sample (N = 18). Results from that first phase will be used to develop a Multiculturalism Scale and survey that will be completed by 100 students. This will be followed by testing for STEM competences and cross-cultural communication skills. Finally, they will employ a case-control methodology by comparing students who persist in STEM programs with those who do not."

Alliance members are OSU, the University of Oklahoma (OU), the University of Tulsa (TU); Langston University (LU), an Historically Black College or University (HBCU); and seven regional universities: East Central University (ECU), Northeastern State University (NSU), University of Central Oklahoma (UCO), Northwestern Oklahoma State University (NWOSU), Southeastern Oklahoma State University (SOSU), Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), Cameron University (CU). Most programs are coordinated through multicultural/diversity offices on each campus.<br/><br/>This proposal accords with NSF?s goal to increase the number of students completing degree programs in STEM fields from historically underrepresented groups. In Oklahoma, this population consists primarily of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. OSU has the largest Native American enrollment in the United States. The Principal Investigator has more than 30 years experience leading multicultural/diversity programs. OK-LSAMP has developed a variety of innovative academic strategies over 14 years, resulting in a dramatic increase in minority STEM undergraduate enrollment and success, and transition to graduate study. Both OSU and OU have Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) programs in place. The Alliance has a committed mentoring cadre of counselors, faculty, staff and alumni. The OK- LSAMP?s main goal for this phase is to recruit and graduate at least 25% more underrepresented minority undergraduates and graduate students compared to 2007-08 numbers.<br/>Program activities will be to recruit increasing numbers of students into STEM fields using enhanced recruitment strategies; support students academically and professionally, relying on strong mentoring networks and links to research opportunities such as EPSCoR and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs); prepare students for global success, including Study Abroad, domestic international activities, and Fulbright Exchanges; and to strengthen an infrastructure that supports student success and professional development. An Advisory Board of minority STEM faculty and staff provides culturally sensitive advice to program leaders.<br/><br/>The proposed activities will result in increased numbers of a wide range of minority groups in the STEM workforce of the United States. The Alliance provides an important national model for promoting the success of Native Americans ? one of the least represented groups in STEM careers. Results of this research will be disseminated widely to inform understanding of how to encourage and support minority STEM education. Building on well-established relationships with local, state, and Indian Nation authorities, OK-LSAMP can expand its impact into diverse communities. By drawing on Oklahoma?s half century of international outreach experience, students will have tremendous opportunities for global engagement ? an essential asset for career and research success. This program will exert a transformative impact by diversifying and internationalizing the scientific work force of the United States, particularly with respect to Native Americans and other underrepresented groups, and by ensuring that all aspects of America?s cultural and ethnic heritage contribute to future leadership in STEM nationwide"

All these issues, many of which interact with changes in land use, are impacting communities that depend on natural resources for recreation, jobs, and economic stability. How can we prepare the next generation of public land stewards with the multidisciplinary skills needed to address impacts of climate change? The Rocky Mountain Sustainability and Science Network (RMSSN) will combine real-world careers and biological education using field experiences to address critical issues for the sustainability and ecological integrity of public lands.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this network focus on undergraduate understanding of biological and sustainability concepts and their application to land management.The RMSSN strives to increase the representation of the multicultural demographic of the western states through active engagement of minority serving institutions and purposefully outreach. The RMSSN has four principle goals. First, identify and assess opportunities for students to develop their understanding of sustainability and biological sciences through experiential learning. Second, build partnerships among federal agencies, non-profits, and academic institutions to address issues of sustainability and student development. Third, build a model of experiential science learning and design assessment tools which will facilitate the application of the RMSSN learning model to other experiential learning programs throughout the country. Fourth, establish a diverse next generation of land stewards who excel in the sciences required to address sustainability issues in the rapidly changing and multicultural intermountain west. <br/><br/>This project is supported jointly by the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Division of Undergraduate Education."

Naturalization rates not only measure the number of new citizens in a society, but also measure the extent to which states and societies formally integrate minorities into their realm. As such, naturalization rules and rates will have a large influence on: the quality of life of immigrants and their children, on ethnic conflict and social solidarity, on attempts at social control, and on the recent efforts at transnational unification (e.g., European Union citizenship and the possibility of North American citizenship). Given the importance of these issues, why do some countries willingly integrate and others block the transformation of strangers into full-fledged citizens? This proposal uses a political economy and institutional framework to explain naturalization rates in 20 countries, and collects new data on naturalization rates and innovative explanatory variables.<br/><br/> Naturalization rates are explained using three methodological approaches-comparative/historical analysis of law and institutions; four case studies; and pooled time series analysis. First, from a comparative historical analysis of law and institutions, it is hypothesized that experiences with colonization and settlement cause high naturalization rates, while non-colonizers have no particular reason to integrate strangers into their country. The main explanatory factors are: colonization from 1855-1955, indigenous population decline from 1800-1920 as a measure of settler country labor supply, and a barrier index to naturalization constructed from national laws. Cross-national regression procedure will be used to explain a major part of the variance in naturalization rates from 1970-95. Controls are used for economic, demographic, cultural, and other variables, and arguments are made against the impact of immigration itself as an explanation of naturalization.<br/><br/> Second, in four case studies using Millsean methods, pairs of culturally similar countries are examined to identify the institutional mechanisms that affected multi-cultural approaches to naturalization. In a comparison of the primary colonizers of France and the UK, the effects of the method of colonization and the elite decisions to pursue citizenship for a larger empire are examined. A documentary and time-series analysis of Germany and Austria show Germany as a non-colonizer developed into a mono-cultural empire hostile to naturalization and Austria as a European colonizer transformed itself into a multi-cultural empire that was more friendly to naturalization. Another documentary analysis of culturally similar countries shows that the Netherlands, as an early and extensive colonizer, has a much more liberal naturalization regime than Belgium, which was a late and reluctant colonizer. And the final comparative case study is of three Anglo-Saxon settler countries where the impact of differential treatment of indigenous peoples on naturalization will be examined. Throughout the case studies, the emphasis is on demonstrating the how elites made open or restrictive decisions about naturalization.<br/><br/> Third, in a pooled time-series and cross-sectional analysis, the unit of analysis is the ""yearcountry"" (i.e., 20 countries from 1970-95 with about 500 cases). This allows a year-to-year analysis of political party power, unemployment, demographic changes, and other factors that are purported to influence naturalization.<br/><br/> Zolberg's approaches to immigration) and will challenge previous economic, demographic and cultural theories of naturalization. It embeds cultural institutions within a larger political economy framework of colonization and emphasizes that theories of naturalization are clearly distinct from theories of immigration."

The research is grounded in the Smith-Zarate exemplar model of perception which holds that social judgments are based on a target's similarity to past specific memory traces of persons rather than on the target's similarity to abstract prototypes or group stereotypes. Eight studies will test this model within an inter-ethnic context on an international border, investigating how past experiences with individuals from various social groups influence the application of social stereotypes. Questions addressed include how minorities are perceived, how the passage of time influences specific memory traces about people, how people learn about new groups, and how a perceiver's own gender and ethnicity influence social perception processes. The consequences of targets' multiple category membership (e.g., ethnicity and gender) on social judgments are examined in this work which, by using photographs rather than linguistic labels, provides more ecological validity than much of the existing research on stereotyping. Another significant strength of the project is the use of an ethnically diverse subject population, which will provide meaningrful answers to the question of how target and perceiver attributes influence intergroup categorization processes. Finally, the project will advance the theoretical development of exemplar theories of memory and categorization, incorporating modeels of steroetyping into other domains of decision making. This research addresses how and why humans categorize others into groups, the mediating processes predicting categorization, and the consequences of categorizations for stereotype formation and change. The fact that any individual can be categorized in multiple ways (e.g., by gender, ethnicity, occupation) is explored in investigations of how categorization of people is influen ced by the social context in which they appear as well as by the perceiver's own attributes. Thus, for example, one study will test the hypothesis that people will be categorized according to whichever of their attributes is most salient (e.g., most unique) in the social context in which they appear, and that such contextually induced categorization can produce later stereotyping even by judges who were not intially so disposed. This research employs a population of Hispanic students that is underrepresented in basic research on stereotyping and it has the unique advantage of advancing theoretically relevant steroetyping research in an envrionment where a disadvantaged minority (Hispanics) are the local majority. The subject population make these studies ideally suited to providing meaningrful answers to the theoretically important question of how target and perceiver attributes influence intergroup categorization processes. This work is highly relevant to the goals of the NSF Human Capital research agenda in the domain of 'disadvantage in a diverse society', since it will contribute to the understanding of basic cognitive processes that foster stereotyping and discrimination as well as how these effects can be exacerbated or ameliorated by different social contexts."

The present research brings together three previously separate bodies of knowledge to further illuminate the nature of choice processes, with a particular emphasis on choice justification -- a phenomenon involving increased preference for a chosen option and decreased preference for a rejected option. The research involves a Gene X Situation X Culture Interaction Framework. Although the present effort is ambitious, recent developments in three relevant areas of research make the effort, not only possible, but also potentially fruitful. <br/><br/>From cultural psychological work we know that choice justification is ubiquitous and, yet, the situations in which it occurs vary systematically across cultures: Whereas European Americans (who tend to see themselves as independent from others) justify choices they make for themselves, Asians (who tend to see themselves as interdependent with others) justify choices they make for their friends. From the neuroscience of decision-making, we know that choice justification occurs at the mesocorticolimbic neural pathway of reward processing. From genetics we know that the neural pathway of reward processing is regulated closely by several dopamine system related genes. In combination, these three bodies of literature add importantly to the current view that choice making is neither static nor merely cognitive. Instead, choice making is best conceptualized as an open, dynamic process that receives constant input from genes, situations, and culture.<br/><br/>To investigate how choice justification depends on genes, situations (i.e., self vs. friend choice), and culture (i.e., European American vs. Asian), the current proposal involves one large-scale, cross-cultural imaging genetics study -- the first of its kind. Both European Americans and East Asians who have either high or low genetic profiles of dopamine signaling capacity will be recruited. They will be scanned while making choices for themselves or for their friends. It is anticipated that when choices are made for the self, choice justification as revealed in activity in the ventral striatal area will be most pronounced for European Americans and, moreover, among European Americans the effect will be stronger for those with genetic profiles linked to high (vs. low) dopamine signaling capacity. In contrast, when choices are made for friends, the choice justification effect as revealed in the same ventral striatal region will be most pronounced for Asians and, moreover, among Asians this effect will be stronger for those with the genetic profiles associated with high (vs. low) dopamine signaling capacity. <br/><br/>If confirmed, the current prediction regarding Gene X Situation X Culture interaction effects will support the view that the study of human mind requires a multi-disciplinary point of view. For example, neither genetics nor neuroscience can be neatly separated from careful analysis of society and culture that provides the context for both genes and the brain to operate. The current work will therefore contribute to teaching, training and knowledge creation of several different fields. Furthermore, the current work will be conducted by a multi-cultural and ethnic group of researchers and research assistants with participants who have multi-cultural and ethnic backgrounds. This work will therefore help educate and train underrepresented groups of individuals in the biological and behavioral sciences."

Reporting directly to Academic Affairs, the Program works in partnership with six campus offices: Equity Programs, Career Services, Multicultural Affairs, Institutional Research, the Center for the Advancement of Teaching and Learning (CTL), and the MU Research Corporation. The inclusion of Administrative Partners in the analysis and review of existing barriers to the success of female STEM faculty has led to the development of work/life policies, programs, and best practices that have built-in administrative support. The objectives for this project are to 1) continue to support pre-tenure female STEM faculty; 2) coordinate faculty recruitment, retention, and policy efforts with the university offices that will sustain them; and 3) establish a Path Forward Committee to monitor the progress of institutionalization.<br/><br/>During this project, MU-ADVANCE will work with university offices to build sustainability for the recruitment, retention, and policy efforts. Recruitment efforts will be coordinated with Equity Programs to implement improved search procedures. To support this implementation, MU-ADVANCE will continue to provide liaisons to STEM search committees, and will maintain a reporting procedure for hiring departments and their college offices that will provide information about the diversity of the applicant pool, the interviewees, and the hires. The Dual Career Services is already a university-wide program sustained by MU Career Services. This service will be expanded by collaborating with neighboring institutions' career development officers. Faculty Development efforts in collaboration with CTL will focus on a university-wide comprehensive new faculty support program for faculty within their first two years, which is a critical transition time when Marshall experiences significant STEM faculty attrition. This program will begin with New Faculty Orientation and continue with a fall Seminar Teaching Series and spring Research Boot Camp, a program that offers new faculty an opportunity for intensive, focused, distraction-free, supervised writing time; thus helping them make steady progress in their specific projects. MU-ADVANCE and CTL will also develop a permanent mentoring program for new faculty based on MU-ADVANCE's coaching sessions which have helped new faculty form networks within Marshall and the community. Efforts to retain tenure-track STEM faculty will continue through strong individualized support and networking. The Policy Committee will conduct ongoing research on faculty teaching loads and salaries, and continue the review of university policies and practices. This Committee will be sustained as the Policy Advisory Committee, which will report to Academic Affairs. University evaluation has been the driving force used to identify barriers and to guide the development of focused plans for each of the Program's initiatives. In collaboration with the Office of Multicultural Affairs, MU-ADVANCE will expand data collection to include the status of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities for our entire campus. A permanent Path Forward Committee, housed within Academic Affairs and reporting to the Provost, will oversee the institutionalization of these efforts. <br/><br/>Because West Virginia (WV) women are among the least likely to succeed professionally and have the lowest levels of education in the country, programs such as MU-ADVANCE are of critical importance. Of Marshall's student population, 56% of undergraduates and 70% of graduate students are female, many of whom are first generation college students. While 41.5% of the faculty at Marshall are women, only 27% of the STEM faculty are women. Therefore, the MU-ADVANCE Program's impact on the number of female faculty represents a broader impact of providing much-needed role models for WV students. In addition, MU-ADVANCE's faculty development programs help female STEM faculty balance and integrate their teaching and service commitments, while building competitive research programs. This increase in research activity has the potential to increase external funding, providing the state of WV, and the metropolitan area of Huntington, economic development opportunities. MU-ADVANCE and the WV Division of Science and Research will develop a state-wide project to disseminate institutional transformation methods. This project will include evaluation (e.g., climate surveys, the status of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities) to provide a data-driven approach to support diversity efforts, create family-friendly atmospheres, and foster faculty development activities at WV colleges and universities."

This dissertation compares how local Evangelical congregations in the United States and Canada construct subcultural identities to define the relationship between their moral values and their increasingly secular, diverse countries. It is proposed that, while Evangelicals in these two countries have equally conservative moral beliefs, they have very different ways of talking about the tension between these beliefs and public life. The researcher will draw on in-depth observation and interviews in four congregations in Hamilton, Ontario and Buffalo, New York, to show how Evangelical congregations in the US and Canada provide the faithful with different cultural resources to negotiate their relationship to the larger society. This research will help us better understand the multiple ways that religious communities negotiate their relationship to multicultural, democratic societies. It will also help us understand how national context affects the relationship between religious commitment and civic engagement. As both Canada and the United States struggle to accommodate ever-greater religious diversity, social-scientific research can contribute to better a understanding of the effects of religious participation on the formation of democratic citizens. Many people in government and civil society are pressed to make policy decisions that respect the autonomy of religious communities, but also build broad support for individual freedom and multicultural democracy. To improve the public's understanding of the role of religion in public life, the researcher will publish a series of concise policy briefs which outline the relevance of this research to government agencies, political parties, and civic organizations. The researcher will also broadly disseminate the results of this research as an adviser to social movement organizations that collaborate with religious communities."

With the addition of an Imaging Center to existing research capacity, scientists at SPMC will be better able to address questions from subcellular to organismal levels within an existing framework of field ecology, oceanography, experimental ecology, chemical/physiological ecology, and molecular biology. The center will allow researchers to take full advantage of existing SPMC resources while developing new research themes in, for example, seagrass ecology, invertebrate larval behavior, ocean acidification, and molecular ecology. The center will house three research-quality microscopes (epifluorescence, DIC-capable compound and stereo microscopes), associated cameras (monochrome, color and high-speed video), imaging software, and supporting computer equipment. This new equipment will support the increasing breadth and complexity of research activities of resident scientists and visiting researchers. It will also provide opportunities for training and research by a host of student researchers at SPMC, including undergraduates participating in NSF-supported REU Site and COSEE internships, and the Multicultural Initiative in the Marine Sciences: Undergraduate Participation (MIMSUP) program. SPMC also trains faculty from local community colleges to incorporate marine science into the curricula of introductory courses, impacting students who typically do not pursue degrees in marine science or science of any discipline. The Imaging Center will play an important role in training workshops for these groups and in outreach efforts to public audiences through the SPMC Public Education Experiential Learning program. Based on activity at SPMC during the past 5 years, we expect that the Imaging Center will annually benefit up to 13 full-time faculty and staff researchers, 20 undergraduate student and 15 graduate student researchers, and some proportion of the 150 students and 700+ visitors who, each year, spend time at SPMC taking courses, participating in workshops, attending lectures or taking tours.<br/><br/>Founded in 1973, and located in Anacortes, Washington, SPMC has as its mandate 1) research on the marine habitats and living resources of the Puget Sound basin, 2) support of undergraduate marine science courses offered by Western Washington University and a number of other public institutions, 3) close articulation between research and instruction at the undergraduate and graduate student levels, 4) expanding the potential for research and training by promoting participation of visiting scientists and 5) assuring broader impact of research and training activities by actively promoting ocean literacy in the general population and by effectively translating research to a broader audience. To fulfill these goals, SPMC participates in a graduate program, an NSF-sponsored program for underrepresented minority students (Multicultural Initiative in the Marine Sciences: Undergraduate Participation) and other undergraduate programs nationwide (REU Site and COSEE programs). The participation by SPMC staff in the work of the Northwest Straits Commission and their local Marine Resource Committees has led to new initiatives to study proposed Marine Protected Areas. Research on other topics of local concern includes studies on the dynamics of macroalgal and microalgal blooms and the impacts of ocean acidification on phytoplankton and on larvae of commercial species. Access by students and visiting scientists to local study sites, including the Shannon Point beach and the nearby Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, enhances the value of SPMC as a location for research on long-term processes that results from the accumulation of data over time and from the stability provided by Shannon Point's supporting facilities."

There is experimental evidence that polyethylene, the most common semicrystalline polymer, actually nucleates via an intermediate ?rotator"" mesophase. However, no theoretical basis yet exists to assess this intriguing hypothesis, or to ascertain how widespread this phenomenon might be in other polymers. Progress requires a theory of the mesophases, able to compute not only their free energy relative to the melt and crystal phases, but also the free energy of the interface between the melt and the mesophase or crystal.<br/><br/>An effective theory of the crystal-melt interface in semicrystalline polymers would also predict the concentration of ?tie chains"", which link together adjacent crystalline lamellae and lead to the toughness and ductility of plastics. Also, there is much current interest in the effect of flow on crystallization kinetics and morphology. This is crucial in commercial use of semicrystalline polymers, which are very sensitive to flow effects. Without a good theory of quiescent crystallization, any effort to understand how flow speeds up nucleation is severely handicapped.<br/><br/>The PI aims to develop the theoretical basis to understand the mesophases in polyethylene. It will lead to predictions for bulk and surface free energies, and it will determine whether nucleation in polyethylene can indeed occur via a mesophase. Given the inherently multiscale nature of the problem, a transformative synthesis of techniques will be employed: atomistic simulation of ordered phases, novel use of ?solid-state simulations"" to characterize mesophase domain walls, mesoscopic discrete-spin simulation of partially ordered mesophases, and a new adaptation of grafted chain ?brush"" theory of the interface between ordered polymer phases and adjacent melt. This unique combination of strategies will lead to a better understanding of how polymer crystals nucleate, and will bring us closer to achieving optimal properties of these truly modern materials.<br/><br/>This intellectually rich problem of practical importance provides an excellent opportunity for education, offering students and postdocs broad exposure to theory, analytical methods, atomistic and mesoscale simulation. The PI is developing an undergraduate course for Fall 2009 in Polymers and Complex Fluids, which is well aligned with the multiscale approach of this proposal. The Chemical Engineering Department has a strong record of minority and gender representation among its graduate students, with about 30 percent women. The College of Engineering has an active Women In Engineering Program and a Multicultural Engineering Program. All simulations will be performed with open source software, to remove any barrier to use by others. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on how polymers crystallize. <br/><br/>Semicrystalline polymers, although relatively young, are the most ubiquitous materials of the modern age. The mass of such materials now produced worldwide each year exceeds the production of steel. Even so, their ultimate potential for desirable mechanical and physical properties is as yet unfulfilled. This is because, in contrast to the centuries-old field of metallurgy, the science base for semicrystalline polymers is still very much a work in progress, with many key results obtained only in the past few decades. Likewise, improved control of polymer molecular structure through advances in catalysis has emerged only relatively recently.<br/><br/>The PI will use theoretical techniques to explore a possible microscopic mechanism for crystallization through an intermediate polymer phase. <br/><br/>This intellectually rich problem of practical importance provides an excellent opportunity for education, offering students and postdocs broad exposure to theory, analytical methods, atomistic and mesoscale simulation.

Mr. Fisher's studies inform the anthropology of both Australian Aboriginal cultural practices and the appropriation of electronic audio and visual media by Indigenous and 4th world peoples. These developments have received increasing interdisciplinary attention as Indigenous communities around the world pursue engagements with media production to ensure their material survival and cultural futures. This project also contributes to anthropological and sociolinguistic research on electronically mediated speech practices, the strategic mobilization of register, dialect stylization, and code-switching in multilingual and/or socially stratified language contact zones. Finally, this work will interest scholars of pidgins and creoles by contributing to our general understanding of the social and linguistic specificity of Aboriginal English."

The research contrasts two visions of a multicultural state: plural society, with distinct and separate ethnic communities that exhibit a high degree of segregation and polarity, and multicultural society in which the various ethnic groups integrate freely, shaping creolized cultural forms and traditions. In Trinidad and Tobago performance is a well-established means of representing identities and engaging in social commentary, and serves in this project as a significant context in which to understand interethnic social relations. The project will analyze performance as individual activism and as community engagement, and will also analyze performance practices, traditions and symbolism.<br/> Intellectual Merit: Focusing on the intersection of the Afro-Trinidadian and Indo-Trinidadian communities in Trinidad and Tobago through reanalyzing the creole concept and its present exclusion of Indo-Trinidadian culture, will contribute to Diaspora Studies, redirecting the focus from relationships between European and non-European communities to relationships between non-European diasporas.<br/> Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this research include creating new survey data on the ethnic composition of Carnival masquerade bands, which will be made available to scholars at the University of the West Indies to be used in further studies on ethnicity and festivals. In addition the researcher is an African-American woman, a member of a group historically underrepresented in the sciences, who will receive training and assistance toward the completion of her doctoral degree in anthropology."

This research will address the processes of incorporation and inclusion of immigrant populations resulting from globalization and transnational processes presently occurring. Specifically it will focus on the interactions of Spanish and first-generation immigrant youth in high school classes designed to promote democratic values and ethical living (part of the EU's so-called ""Citizenship"" curricula). <br/><br/>The researcher will use participant observation, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and audio/video recordings to document how immigrant and Spanish students examine their own multicultural existences with each other and with teachers. The research will take place at high schools in three towns with distinct demographic profiles, with the objectives of (a) assessing the prevalence of East-versus-West arguments around ideals of freedom, equality, autonomy, and secularism taught in the Citizenship classes; (b) documenting political and cultural debates inside and outside of classrooms; and (c) historically contextualizing current debates about immigrant inclusion, education, and citizenship at the local, national, and pan-European levels. <br/><br/>There are numerous broader impacts from this research. The project is significant because it will deepen understanding of how publicly-schooled youth in highly diverse settings engage with civic and ethical education intended to promote ""unity-in-diversity"" across the entire EU. Given the racial, linguistic, religious, and cultural differences that have segregated communities in southeast Spain, the findings from this study will also contribute to education policy and curriculum development while offering a first-hand view of an upcoming, newly multicultural generation of citizens learning to handle social inclusion and democratic action. Such results will prove relevant to policy makers, educators, community organizers and scholars around the world who seek ways of understanding how democracy and pluralism can grow in tandem, particularly when it comes to marginalized and often stigmatized, non-Western groups."

The wild-type p53 protein acts as a controller of cell growth and cell death. The negative feedback regulator of p53, Mdm2, is critically important to sustain development. p53 activates expression of mdm2 and the Mdm2 protein in turn inactivates p53 by either repressing its transcriptional activity or facilitating its degradation by the proteasome. The Bargonetti laboratory and colleagues are among only a few groups that have provided evidence that Mdm2 forms both soluble as well as chromatin-bound complexes with p53 in human cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that this process exemplifies an important basic transcription regulation program where Mdm2 influences the recruitment of factors to chromatin to prevent functional transcription, but this has yet to be fully elucidated. Human cell lines are used to investigate the chemical nature and function of p53-Mdm2 chromatin-associated complexes and their impact on transcription. The Bargonetti group is carrying out basic research in combination with a strong broader impact objective to produce the next generation of multicultural and multiethnic scientists. The core objectives of the project are the following: 1) Determine if Mdm2 blocks transcription initiation or elongation at p53 target genes. 2) Characterize the role of Mdm2 on histone modifications at p53 target genes. 3) Determine if Mdm2 and p300 act as competitors for the p53 transcription factor in Mdm2 over-expression cell culture models. 4) Examine the regulation of chromatin-associated p53 by Mdm2 proteins produced from alternatively spliced mdm2. Based on the results obtained from this project the ability of the alternate forms of Mdm2 to influence p53 transcriptional activity, recruitment of p300 and PCAF, and regulation of local and distal histone modification will be determined. 5) Integrate research and teaching as a method to excite the next generation, multiethnic, science work force.<br/><br/>The project being carried out by the Bargonetti laboratory group integrates research and teaching as a method to excite the next generation, multiethnic, science work force.

The project will add samples of Hmong and Cambodian refugees from different urban areas to an existing data base on minority identity among Southeast Asian refugees. The quantitative data base is a survey of 50 Hmong in a small, nearly all-white city and 50 Cambodians in a large, multicultural city. Even with control variables, the Hmong consistently have a stronger minority identity as measured by social distance, expectations of discrimination, and the belief that their group is disliked by native whites. The project seeks to determine if this difference is due to ethnicity or urban location. Qualitative data from follow-up interviews suggests that ethnicity is a cause of the variation. Cambodian ethnicity has fluid ethnic boundaries which leads to a weak sense of in- and out-group opposition. Hmong ethnicity has rigid ethnic boundaries which leads to a strong opposition between in- and out-groups. Fluid or rigid ethnic boundaries are due to (1) being a majority or minority group in the homeland, (2) one's view of the U.S. state in the Vietnam War, and (3) the role of ancestry in creating kinship groups. Obtaining samples of Hmong from a large, multicultural city and Cambodians from a small, nearly all-white city will provide the needed data to establish that homeland ethnicity can minimize or magnify the formation of a minority identity in the United States."

Media accounts on television, radio, or in print make vivid the extent of physical damage and the most evident consequences to life and limb. While word spreads with dispatch both nationally and internationally, lead stories change with almost as much dispatch. Often there is mention of crime, altered patterns of victimization, or looting, but the impact of such events on the social fabric of a community is little understood. Dr. Kuhl seeks to respond to this gap in our knowledge by a timely, sustained, and systematic study of social control in three communities affected by the California earthquake. The research focuses on crime, victimization, social service, and social control both prior and subsequent to the earthquake in communities that differ in terms of cultural, economic, and social conditions. Specifically, the study focuses on the hardest hit communities in San Francisco (primarily upper-middle class, Caucasian areas), Oakland (black, lower-class areas), and Watsonville (lower class areas with migrant and illegal migrant Hispanic residents). Multiple methods will be used in the research including agency records, periodicals, crime reports, and in-depth interviews with private individuals as well as with community leaders, agency workers, and public officials. This project will create a unique data set that should be invaluable to understanding how social control systems operate and how patterns of crime and victimization evolve in crisis situations."

Hawai' i is a multicultural society in which there is no racial or cultural majority, and where a strong indigenous cultural and political movement brings to the fore a clear cultural and epistemic dimension to technology policy controversies. The nature of open ocean mariculture technology that depends on a common resource demands a level of consensus among the broader community. These two conditions make the case of mariculture in Hawaii highly instructive for understanding the role of culture in mediating the interplay between technology and society. The main research questions are: <br/>How does culture influence the mutual interplay of technology and society in a multicultural plurality? <br/>How do cultural differences complicate conflicts, in this case those surrounding property changes brought by mariculture technology? <br/>What are the implications of the findings for the technological development, the evolution of property regimes, and cultural transformation? <br/>This investigation of the introduction of mariculture uses the qualitative method of event analysis; it follows the actors from different standpoint epistemologies to solicit their framing of the events, interactions and surrounding controversies. Key actors include mariculture entrepreneurs, scientists, Native Hawaiian advocates and cultural practitioners, fishers, state agency personnel, land-based <br/>aquaculture farmers and state legislators. Operational questions are organized along four areas of inquiry including: a) substance, character and dynamics of controversies; b) property claims; <br/>c) social contests, techno-scientific choices and evolving property regimes; and d) cultural norms and practices."

Increasingly, they resist scientific inquiry that they view as in conflict with their values. In the U.S. and Canada, our research sites, indigenes are regulating research, making property claims on scientific data, and requiring certain benefits in return for granting researchers access to their communities. Native American tribes show interest in initiating/funding genomic research in order to directly bolster their intellectual and governance capacities. Tribes also emphasize and fund training in science and technology fields as a capacity-building strategy that they see as necessary for self-governance and community flourishing. Accordingly, Native Americans and Canadian First Nation individuals enter technoscientific fields in order to support indigenous self governance and to diversify in terms of personnel and modes of thought fields that impact indigenous lives. <br/>This project will investigate indigenous genome scientists as agents in the democratization of genome science fields using archival and ethnographic methods. Because they facilitate or challenge indigenous genome scientists? roles as knowledge producers at the intersection of genomics and indigenous governance, tribal regulators, cultural experts, and community members will also be a focus of research, especially as they address the intersections of genomics with both indigenous ?traditional? and bureaucratized ways of knowing. Subjects will be drawn from fields to which indigenous peoples and governments are connected; they include basic human population genetics research (i.e. on human migrations and evolutionary questions) and biomedical research. Indigenous scientists are still few in number and they work with non-indigenous collaborators who also broker knowledge and opportunities for scientific inquiry between the laboratory and the tribe. Thus we will also focus on non-indigenous scientists? roles in integrating scientific practices, priorities, and values into indigenous governance.<br/>Intellectual merit<br/>This research has intellectual merit for genome science fields, for STS, and for society. The work of indigenous scientists and collaborators may suggest cross-fertilizations of values and knowledges. Diversifying the classroom, the field, and the laboratory may be only the beginning.

For STS, this research adds to its postcolonial strand of scholarship, which is undertreated in the U.S. and which is important for making STS itself more multicultural.<br/>Broader impacts<br/>This research will suggest opportunities for and highlight the barriers to making genome science norms more multi-cultural and compatible with indigenous communities? needs. Will the result be cross-fertilizations of genomics and indigenous knowledges and values as the field and laboratory are diversified?

A major reason for the absence of data is the difficulty in systematically surveying a small, bicoastally-distributed, and ethnically and linguistically diverse population. However, the regionally-concentrated and highly metropolitan residential pattern of the population also permits opportunity to selectively sample Asian Americans from localities where they are most likely to congregate. Telephone households in the top metropolitan areas of Asian populations in the United States will be sampled using a multi-frame approach consisting of unrestricted random-digit dialing Asian exchange density, random-digit dialing at targeted Asian exchange density, and listed-surname frames. A total of 1,000 adult Asians belonging to the six largest Asian ethnic groups and residing in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Honolulu, and Chicago will be interviewed by phone, with 200 completed interviews from each of the five locations. <br/><br/>An initiative to gather primary data on the political attitudes and behavior of Asian Americans is direly needed to bridge the research and data gaps in the studying of American political behavior and the state of the U.S. democracy as a multicultural society. Although large-scale, nationally representative public opinion data have been collected specifically from the African and Hispanic American population, no such data exist for the studying of the political opinion of the nation's third largest and fastest growing minority population. Without such data, it is difficult to gauge the shape of the Asian American political community at the national level. Neither is it possible to advance our understanding of the sources of uneven incorporation of this minority population into the U.S. economic and political systems. Information gathered from this initiative would represent a significant expansion in hypothesis testing concerning race and political behavior as well as of research coverage to geographic locations and American ethnic groups neglected in the extant literature. <br/><br/>This research is an integral part of the investigator's career plans and goals to advance the scholarship, visibility, and influence of Asian Americans--particularly Asian immigrant women--in Political Science and Ethnic Studies. Data and experience gained from this pilot study will be evaluated and used to secure research partnership and major foundation support for the conducting of a larger and more comprehensive multiracial survey to address the nation's issues of inequality in social and political participation and incorporation. This ultimately will contribute to the larger goal of promoting equal opportunities in social and political participation regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and nativity through rigorous social science research and cross-disciplinary intellectual exchange. In these ways, an award from POWRE is critical not only to the advancement of the investigator's career at this juncture, but to the expansion of knowledge and understanding about Asian Americans as a political community and about America as a multicultural democracy."

The research promises to create fundamental understanding of amorphous matrices, leading to effective new amorphous matrix systems for delivery of highly active, poorly bioavailable drugs. It will thus address a key impediment to productive drug development. The proposal has the following specific objectives: (1) Elucidate key requirements for polymeric stabilization of the amorphous form of model drugs in both the solid and solution phases by mechanistic studies. (2) Create screening methods to rapidly evaluate novel cellulose derivatives. (3) Synthesize two novel families of cellulose derivatives designed for drug miscibility, slow release, and pH-triggered release, as well as safety. (4) Design second generation cellulose derivatives based on screening results and solubility testing of key drugs with solubility and bioavailability issues. The team at Virginia Tech will synthesize novel long chain ester derivatives of carboxymethyl cellulose, and novel adipate esters of cellulose, varying the degree of substitution of carboxymethyl and other substituents to provide a range of hydrophobicity and release rates. The team at Purdue will carry out polarized light optical microscopy of spin coated polymer/model drug films that will provide mechanistic understanding and ultimately a screening method for new polymer delivery systems. They will screen solution stabilization by visible and UV spectroscopy of drug in polymer solution, using 1H NMR spectroscopy of the solutions to provide mechanistic understanding. Mechanistic understanding of how amorphous drugs are stabilized in the solid state, and especially in solution, by polymeric matrices, and creation of novel stabilization screening methods will provide valuable new tools of general use in the field. Furthermore, the research will generate biomaterials forming the basis of new drug delivery systems for rescue of failed pipeline drugs, enhancing efficacy of marketed drugs, and enabling conversions of injectable formulations to oral for enhanced compliance.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: Many important drugs, including several anticancer and antifungal agents, suffer from poor bioavailability due to the low aqueous solubility of their crystalline forms. One strategy for addressing this problem is to produce the drug in an amorphous modification, given the generally improved solubility of the amorphous material. This proposal develops a general approach to using cellulose derivatives to suppress drug crystallinity and enhance bioavailabilty. It will develop a systematic approach to understanding the mechanisms underlying this enhancement. The work could have very substantial impact inasmuch as effective delivery of many drugs represents a major impediment to their efficient implementation. The project provides an attractive multidisciplinary platform for the training of students, who will be associated not only with synthesis and characterization of materials but with developing drug formulations with practical utility. Minority undergraduate research participation will be encouraged at Purdue through the existing Pharmacy Multicultural Program, which provides 50% cost sharing for the student stipend. Past experience suggests that 3-5 students will be involved each year during the summers as well as the academic year."

The new method is based on a specialized form of laser mass spectrometry, combined with microscopy in a unique instrument. This approach will have the spatial resolution necessary to isolate small quantities of organic material in discrete layers of tiny mounted samples from paintings (called cross sections), and the sensitivity to provide molecularly specific identification of materials present in very low concentrations. The unambiguous identification of artists' materials at a molecular and microstructural level can elucidate historic geological or biological material sources, manufacturing processes and trade routes. An understanding of works of art additionally assists conservators and curators develop the storage and exhibition protocols necessary to protect and preserve works of art, and assists art historians in their investigations into the relationships between an object, the artist, and the historical and cultural environments in which it was created. The R2PI-uMS technique developed in this work is also expected to enhance scientific research in a number of diverse fields other than art conservation, ranging from organic surface analysis in the electronics industry, to analysis/testing in the modern paint industry, to the study of spatial distributions of metabolites in cells in botanical or biological studies. <br/><br/>The graduate students that are involved in the project will have the unique opportunity of working in both academic and cultural heritage research environments, helping to foster the next generation of scientists engaged in cultural heritage science. In addition to training graduate students, the researchers will involve undergraduate and high school students in the framework of UCSB sponsored outreach programs to minority students and high schools and the Getty's Graduate Intern and Multicultural Undergraduate Internship programs. In an additional collaboration, students from Jackson State University, a historically black college, will also participate in the project. By involving such a diverse group of researchers, the PIs will work to increase participation of minority students in STEM fields."

The mode of investigation will be primarily computational quantum chemistry, augmented by experimental methods when necessary. Computational methods are important for research on this class of compounds because experimental studies present many difficulties. Lithium carbenoids are air sensitive and highly reactive, and can often be studied only at low temperatures. Spectroscopic measurements provide clues but cannot, when used alone, elucidate the detailed mechanisms of this class of reactants. Computational quantum chemistry will be used to determine the species that are likely to be present in solution, and to estimate the activation energies of each hypothetical reaction step. Modern quantum methods can estimate these barriers with chemical accuracy, e.g., within one or two kcal/mol. In this way, Professor Pratt will gather a large quantity of data that will allow him to determine which species react, what the reactive intermediates are, if any, and how fast the reactions are likely to occur.This work will result in a better understanding of organic reaction mechanisms. <br/><br/>The funding of this work by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program will result in more efficient methods for organic synthesis, including hard to synthesize natural products that are used by the pharmaceutical industry. Also, an enhanced understanding of the available computational methods and their limitations will result from this work.

The upgrade will serve the needs of strong research and instructional programs in tropical marine ecology, biodiversity, ocean acidification, conservation biology, and oceanography. The reefs of Moorea are among the best studied in the world, as a result of a long history of research initiated by French scientists and other international researchers, including a growing involvement from the U.S. The new infrastructure will support a diverse group of researchers and their students, building on the NSF-funded Moorea Coral Reef LTER and other NSF-funded research in the marine sciences on Moorea. Coral reefs of the islands of the Pacific are hotspots for biological diversity and are sources of great societal significance and economic value. They represent some of the best-preserved coral reefs remaining anywhere on Earth. Local and global processes, often associated with human activities, however, increasingly threaten the continued health of these exceptional natural systems. Thus, new research on population dynamics, ecosystem processes, biodiversity and resilience of coral reefs is critical to their successful management, conservation, and restoration. This project will enhance the ability to understand and sustain these systems and the services they provide society through process-oriented research and long-term studies. <br/><br/>The upgrade will promote advanced training in marine science at the graduate and undergraduate level, benefiting students from universities and colleges from across the United States. Located in French Polynesia, the project will have the added benefit of providing international and multi-cultural experience for American scientists and students. The Gump Station has a strong outreach program through collaborations brokered by its partner local community organization: Association Te Pu Atitia. The upgrade will strengthen marine science research and education on Moorea enabling the Gump Station and Te Pu Atitia to communicate these findings to the local community - particularly K-12 schools - and to further develop programs that reach out to historically underrepresented groups in science (including Polynesians and other Pacific Islanders).

The development of crop cultivars that can survive short-term flooding can help stabilize and increase food production. The recent recognition of rice varieties tolerant to short-term flooding has led to the identification of the submergence tolerance regulator gene called SUB1A. The precise genetic characterization of SUB1A has allowed breeders to develop new high-yielding rice varieties with submergence tolerance that are now grown in flood-prone fields of South and Southeast Asia. This project will continue the molecular characterization of SUB1A and seek new submergence regulators that act earlier in development. Rice plants that can survive flooding during seed germination can reduce labor cost and herbicide use. The effectiveness of combining SUB1A with the recently identified ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 (AG1) gene will be explored in rice. Additionally, the characterization of molecular responses to flooding will be extended to corn, a vital grain crop that is flooding sensitive. These analyses will examine genetic variation in anaerobic germination and submergence tolerance in maize as well as profile and manipulate molecular responses to these stresses. The results will provide a greater understanding of sensing, signaling and response mechanisms to flooding during seed germination and vegetative growth in rice and maize. The research will be carried out at a Hispanic Serving institution. Postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers will receive cross-disciplinary training in physiology, molecular biology, analytical chemistry and systems biology in a multicultural laboratory and institute environment. The development and dissemination of a science-learning module will allow 8th graders, many from underrepresented groups, at Title I schools to participate in hands-on science experiments demonstrating the significance of plant biology research on food security and sustainable agriculture.

Studies of glycosylated and unglycosylated amphipathic alpha helices will be facilitated by the chemical synthesis of Fmoc-protected O-linked glycosyl-amino acids that can be incorporated into helical peptide sequences. By varying the relative amount and spatial distribution of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface areas of the helices, glycopeptides with different bilayer affinities can be created and studied by several biophysical methods. Classical solution H(1)-NMR protein methods for conformational analysis can be exploited in the presence of deuterated micelles and bicelles that mimic bilayer environments. Molecular mechanics (Monte Carlo methods) will be directed by nuclear Overhauser (NOE) data to understand the conformational ensembles of the glycopeptides as the environment is changed from aqueous (homogeneous media) to amphipathic (heterogeneous media). Solid-state H(2)-NMR and N(15)-NMR methods will be used to observe the orientation of glycopeptides helices with respect to oriented lipid bilayers, as well as to observe their effect on bilayer structure. Based on the observed structures, hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface areas will be calculated.<br/><br/>With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Polt will examine interaction of glycopeptides with membrane bilayers, which is not well studied, but is likely to impact the understanding of such diverse biological phenomena as the interaction of peptide/glycopeptide hormones and neurotransmitters with receptors, display of peptide antigens, and mechanisms of viral entry.

The legacy of a lack of access to a high quality and rigorous education in mathematics for historically marginalized populations is that these groups are significantly and consistently underrepresented in STEM education, degrees, and careers. The primary goal of AMA is to develop capacity at DU to significantly increase the number of diverse and low-income students graduating from DU with a degree in mathematics and a master's degree and teaching license in secondary mathematics. A secondary goal is to create an academic pipeline for students at CCA who have finished substantial mathematics coursework to transfer to DU as a mathematics major and eventually become mathematics teachers in secondary schools.<br/><br/>The project will be directed by the following five guiding principles: (a) instruction that is considerate of students' backgrounds and needs carried out by well-trained and dedicated faculty; (b) academic support for students to develop intellectually as well as confidence in their mathematical abilities; (c) social support for students to be integrated into the DU community; (d) ongoing student access to successful (student and faculty) role models; and (e) recognition and celebration of students' achievements. This project will address the underrepresentation of diverse and low-income students in STEM by creating a mathematical pipeline between CCA and DU. Three courses will be developed in the early stages of this project. The first two courses, a ""transition to college calculus"" course, and a proofs/logic course in mathematics, have specifically been selected because success in these courses is critical to the future success of mathematics majors. The third course is a ""capstone"" course in secondary mathematics. A goal in all of these courses will be to foster students' mathematical reasoning as they solve problems and share and develop mathematical ideas with peers. A working hypothesis of the project is that through engaging students in instruction in which the development of mathematical reasoning through discourse is modeled, students will learn how to implement such instruction and this will benefit them when they start teaching. Each of these courses will include instruction in best practices for teaching mathematics to English language learners (ELLs) and will leverage the extensive social and financial support provided for students in two existing DU programs, the Volunteers in Partnership (VIP) program and the Center for Multicultural Excellence (MCE). The VIP program provides financial support for low-income students who commit to working on a volunteer basis in local high schools through the year. In addition, a Math Club at CCA will be initiated and members of this new club will carry out supplemental instruction in Aurora schools. AMA Fellows will also serve as volunteers in participating VIP high schools. The service activities that AMA Fellows will experience through VIP and the CCA Math Club will help prepare them to be effective teachers in high-need schools. This project will initiate a research study to understand the complexities associated with recruiting, retaining, and graduating diverse students and low-income students who major in mathematics in order to become secondary mathematics teachers in high-need schools. It will also initiate a longitudinal study of diverse, low-income students to determine best strategies for recruitment as well as obtaining student perspectives of what program activities are most beneficial. This will involve individual and focus group interviews with the students."

Recent work has found that the belief that emotions spread predicts reports of increased emotional expression and support seeking in Americans. The proposed study extends previous research to 1) identify the relationships between the beliefs that emotions spread and in-the-moment emotional behavior, and 2) explore whether these relationships are consistent across cultural contexts or are culturally dependent. Assessing the relationship between emotion beliefs and behaviors in two cultural contexts with documented differences in models of emotion will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of emotional behavior across cultural contexts. This understanding may improve the ability for international and multicultural settings, such as workplaces and schools, to facilitate intercultural interactions and benefit from their diversity. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Eunkook Suh at Yonsei University in Korea. <br/><br/>In order to test these questions, American and Korean participants will be primed to think that emotions are either very easily spread or not easily spread. Emotional behavior will be assessed through videos of participants describing recent emotional experiences as if they were speaking to a close friend. It is hypothesized that European Americans primed with the belief that emotions spread will express higher levels of positive and negative emotions. If this pattern reflects basic emotional processes, it is expected that Korean participants will also be more expressive following this prime. However, concern about the negative consequences of emotions on relationships and interactions is more salient in Korean than American contexts.

This project will provide an early-career international research experience for fifteen (15) undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Five Colleges consortium. The PI and co-PI will recruit three cohorts of students to conduct systematic, comparative research around the theme of ""Cultural Heritage in European Societies and Spaces (CHESS)"" as part of a three-year research project and training program in collaboration with the Department of Anthropological Sciences at the University of Barcelona in Spain. For each of the three years, research projects will be organized around a central research stream: highlighting specific strengths of the US and Spanish faculty: 1) ""Crisis, culture, and heritage"" (2013-2014); 2) ""Sustainable heritage, communities, and economies"" (2014-2015); and 3) ""Social Justice, heritage, and changing forms of value"" (2015-2016). Students will be trained through a course series in research design and methods, field research in Europe, and data analysis and writing for publication. International research and training workshops at the two universities will provide US students with intensive mentoring from renowned European scholars, as well as networking and collaboration with their international peers. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Anthropologists have critically engaged the concepts of culture and heritage for decades, but the rise of the field of heritage studies offers new opportunities for ethnographic investigation of how these central disciplinary concepts are being used by policymakers, citizens, and other social actors. By developing their projects in relation to a central set of research questions, students will contribute to three key areas of inquiry for the larger comparative investigation of culture and heritage as sites of contestation, conflict, and cohesion in Europe. The proposed CHESS program provides an integrative framework for an ethnographic field school that will draw the participation of students across the four subfields of anthropology (cultural, linguistic, archaeological, and biological) and serve as a model for interdisciplinary research teambuilding. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: Government institutions face new demands to develop public programming that reflects our nation's diverse, multicultural heritage, and there is a growing need for social scientists trained in the anthropology of heritage and related fields. Broader impacts of the project include 1) training a diverse group of fifteen (15) US students for international, comparative anthropological research on cultural heritage policies and debates, 2) developing scientific research networks between anthropologists in the US and Spain that will form the basis for further international research projects and ongoing relationships, including synergistic initiatives between the UMass Department of Anthropology, and new certificate programs in Heritage and Society Studies and Modern European Studies, the Five Colleges consortium, and European partner institutions; 3) collaborating with faculty and students from Spain to produce a body of systematic, comparative research on debates surrounding heritage management in Europe, including research reports, peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, project-related theses, and multimedia case studies for use by community organizations, policymakers, and classroom instructors. These publications are available to the general public through a CHESS project website professionally archived by the UMass Amherst library. Holding an international CHESS workshop at UMass Amherst each year of the program further extends the broader impacts enabling at least 30 U.S. students to develop international professional networks, mentoring relationships, and collaborators."

The collaboration with IMM is focused on investigating electrodeposited nanocrystalline bismuth telluride materials for highly efficient thermoelectric energy conversion. Nanocrystalinity has been recently shown as being a very effective method for improving the efficiency of thermoelectric materials; in parallel, electrodeposition is an inexpensive technique that can be used to manufacture nanostructured materials. A systematic study will be undertaken to investigate methods to control crystallite size of electrodeposited materials, with emphasize on spatial confinement of electrodeposition, which will be achieved by deposition in cylindrical nanopores. The thermoelectrical properties of the new materials will be thoroughly characterized to correlate crystallite size with property enhancement. RPI students will participate in both material synthesis (at IMM)) and property characterization (at IMM and RPI). As a pre-requisite to the summer program in Spain, all students will take an independent study with the PI to learn about experimental methods and theoretical aspects relevant to the proposed studies.<br/><br/>The broader impact is multi-faceted. A cost-effective method for manufacturing highly efficient thermoelectric devices will greatly facilitate the application of thermoelectric devices in numerous fields, most important for waste heat recovery. Moreover, this will be the first time to explore spatial confining of electrochemical deposition to control grain size of electroplated materials. The results of these studies may find applications in other fields such as nanomanufacturing; electroplating in nanopores could become a basic tool for developing nanocrystalline materials. Furthermore, the students involved in this study will start building up an international professional network and will learn to work in an interdisciplinary, multi-cultural environment. The results of this collaboration will be disseminated by presentations at conferences, publication of journal papers, as well as outreach to high school students and teachers."

Multiphase flows are flowing streams of fluids that are mixtures of liquids with other liquids, gases, and/or solids; examples include oil and vinegar in salad dressing (liquid/liquid), water and air in soda (liquid/gas), or water and cement in concrete slurry (liquid/solid). Multiphase flows and their control play a vital role in many key technologies impacting the world economy, such as metallurgy, mineralogy, materials processing, devices for biological applications, and the automobile, pharmaceutical, aerospace, and energy industries. This project will advance materials engineering by investigating critical research challenges in multiphase flows - understanding and predicting the patterns, instabilities, and turbulence that arise - to develop and optimize materials and processes for industry. This PIRE team will integrate the results from across a related sets of experiments including: study of patterned flows and microfluidic mixing to improve micro-chip immunological assays; use of microactuators and microsensors to study instabilities and turbulence in multiphase systems; use of microgravity conditions to examine the role of fluid instabilities; experimental and computational study of dynamic flow of elongated particles/fibers; and expansion of current models of dispersed turbulent flow via large-scale simulation. <br/><br/>International collaboration is essential to advancing our understanding of multiphase flows. Complex multiphase flow research requires high speed computation and high-level laboratory experimentation in which all three PIRE partner countries have substantial complementary resources. The University of Florida is internationally recognized for its programs in multiphase thermo-fluid mechanics and flow control. Both Japan and France sustain strong research emphases in thermal-fluid mechanics with key centers of excellence in multiphase flow. Japan emphasizes technology in areas such as materials science, microgravity science, bioassays and aeropropulsion while France emphasizes technology in nuclear energy, environment, bio-sensors, and flow control. This award leverages strong existing research collaborations and reciprocated access for U.S. scientists and students to facilities and expertise not available in the U.S. The international collaboration will also help industries in all three countries to engage highly-trained personnel in fields involving applications of multiphase science and technologies.<br/><br/>The strength of this PIRE's educational program is its plan to train U.S. students as global professionals with versatility in professional abilities and attitudes that make them competitive in the global marketplace. U.S. graduate students will be supported to work in an international setting with foreign collaborators and advisors, functioning and communicating in a multi-cultural atmosphere. Unique educational opportunities include industry-relevant short courses, training in cutting-edge research, cultural awareness workshops, and international symposia and conferences. Internships in industrial research laboratories will give them access to networking opportunities with industry within an international context. Active recruitment of students from underrepresented groups will contribute to diversifying and internationalizing the body of U.S. students earning STEM graduate degrees. A certificate program in Multiphase Science and Technology will be developed and offered through online distance learning modules, thus making it available to international partners and their students, interested students at other U.S. universities, and as continuing education for industrial partners. U.S. researchers will also build skill sets needed for research in international contexts via cross-collaboration with international partners and co-advising foreign students. <br/><br/>This PIRE project is likely to have significant institutional impacts. It will strengthen and internationalize research networks that address complicated multiphase technological problems. It will help to build up an international engineering research center of excellence in complex fluids and multiphase flows with partnerships between international industry and academe that yield long-term benefit to the U.S. economy. Such partnerships will also encourage industry participation in education, international research cooperation, and student internships. The partner institutions are committed to exploring joint and dual degree programs, which would further internationalize the U.S. institutions and enrich collaborative opportunities for future students and faculty alike. Through these multifaceted initiatives and activities, this PIRE project will serve as a model for both U.S. and international partner institutions as they work to internationalize their own research and education portfolios. <br/><br/>U.S. partners include the University of Florida and Florida State University. French partners include Universit de Poitiers, Universit Lille 1 Sciences et Technologies, Universit Paris-Sud 11, Institut de Mcanique des Fluides de Toulouse (IMFT), and Universit de Provence Aix-Marseille 1, and Universit Bordeaux 1.

Student recruitment will target underrepresented groups by advertising via the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography's Multicultural Program and the American Society for Microbiology online (including the Minority Affairs online newsletter), the Microbe magazine,<br/>and distribution via the NIH list-serv focused on to minority scientists. This broad coverage will reach various levels of scientist in addition to women and minority scientists. Additionally, each chair of the special sessions will also send out a call for participation that highlights the student activities and awards at the meeting, and will specifically encourage participation<br/>by underrepresented groups."

At the same time, these capabilities serve as the foundation for the design and development of novel applications of optical science. This Materials World Network project explores the science behind the interaction of light with exotic material structures having vanishingly small dielectric permittivity, also known as epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, that are potentially able to dramatically suppress diffraction of light and to extend the applicability of the quasi-static approximation to wavelength-scale systems. In this project, the researchers will create a novel material platform of ""designer"" ENZ media and will use this platform for building an analytical description of the optics of ENZ-related systems. Specifically, a set of experimental techniques will be developed for subwavelength lateral control of the permittivity profile of our materials, targeting important visible and IR frequency ranges. Optical characterization of these structures will be used to provide the foundation for novel numerical and analytical techniques capable of describing the light-matter interaction in complex ENZ-based media. It is expected that both the experimental and theoretical results of this work will have broader application for plasmonic- and meta- materials across the UV to THz wavelength ranges. The students involved in the project will benefit from the unique exposure to modern interdisciplinary projects combining materials science, chemistry, physics, and applied mathematics, and involving multiple institutions across the globe. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Optical science is increasingly interwoven with many aspects of our everyday life, from optical communications, to imaging, to a broad range of optical sensing technologies in health-, environmental, and security-related applications. New optical materials, with unique, yet designer-enabled, properties, promise to further improve the quality or our life, and perhaps as importantly, provide a better understanding of the fundamental interaction between two building blocks of our Universe, light and matter. In this Materials World Network project, an international team will develop a unique new class of materials, known as epsilon-near-zero materials, and analyze the interaction of these materials with light. This research has the potential to provide a novel material platform for merging optics and electronics technologies, bringing together the benefits of high-speed optical communications with the compactness of integrated circuits. The complementary expertise of the participants will provide a unique opportunity to expose participating students to modern interdisciplinary international collaboration, enhancing multi-discipline and multi-cultural exchange. The interaction between the research teams and the broader community will aim at increasing the participation of emerging scientists in STEM-related disciplines.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Electronic and Photonic Materials program and Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research."

She will be studying extrasolar planets that are up to four times larger than Earth and that orbit their stars faster than Mercury orbits the Sun. No such planets exist in our Solar System, yet they are extremely common, so it is not well understood how they formed. Thankfully, the Kepler Mission provides thousands of such planets to analyze. Wolfgang aims to better understand the characteristics and possible histories of these planets by adopting a big-picture approach which incorporates the available yet incomplete information about each. In particular, she will combine physical models of different evolutionary processes with a sophisticated population-wide statistical framework to identify the most probable ways that these planets came to have their current compositions and orbits. For her education efforts, Wolfgang will develop and implement interactive, hands-on activities for a multicultural community of Penn State freshmen who are interested in pursuing careers in science and engineering. Because these activities more genuinely reflect the process of scientific inquiry and discovery than most college laboratory assignments and coursework, these students will gain valuable experience with the skills needed to do cutting-edge research and will begin to develop confidence and an identity as a scientist.<br/><br/>The Kepler Mission has demonstrated that sub-Neptune-sized planets are ubiquitous in our Galaxy, yet it is a challenge to understand their compositional structure and to explain their close-in orbits. Progress on these and other topics in planet formation and evolution theory has been challenged by large measurement uncertainties as well as significant detection biases and selection effects in the detected Kepler population. Wolfgang will meet this need for a more data-driven approach by coupling a sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian framework to physical models and theoretical simulations of important evolutionary processes. In particular, she will investigate the compositional and orbital evolution of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, quantifying the degree to which photoevaporation and Kozai-Lidov oscillations have affected these planets' properties since the dispersal of their protoplanetary disks. In doing so, Wolfgang will be able to supply robust end conditions to planet formation theory and accelerate theoretical understanding of the dominant processes during planet formation. Wolfgang will mentor female astrophysics undergraduate and graduate students, advise undergraduate research projects, serve as an instructor for the Penn State Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers, and implement inquiry-based activities to encourage the students in these programs - who often are members of minority groups underrepresented in the sciences - to develop scientific thinking skills and an identity as a scientist."

The catalytic activity of these enzymes is regulated at two levels: first, through conformational transitions occurring on the catalytic timescale allowing the enzyme to attain a state capable of RNA polymerization; second, through regulatory interactions with other proteins in the context of a multi-protein RNA polymerase complex. The proposed research, through a combination of biophysical/structural studies and biochemical/functional assays, will elucidate the nature and importance of these two levels of regulation in a bacteriophage RdRp. The multidisciplinary nature of the research will provide training for students from various backgrounds at multiple stages of their professional preparation. These efforts will be in line with the overarching mission of the City College of New York to provide a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic research and training environment that is inclusive of groups underrepresented in the sciences including minorities and women. In order to strengthen the pipeline of students from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in the STEM disciplines, the PI will refine and expand his outreach activities to several New York area high schools including one situated in one of the poorest congressional districts in the country.<br/><br/> Biochemical studies on viral RdRps have indicated that specific conformational changes at the polymerase active site influence the rate of nucleotide addition during the elongation stage of RNA polymerization. The nature of these conformational changes remains unknown despite the availability of crystal structures of several viral RdRps. The proposed research will resolve this longstanding problem by combining solution NMR to probe dynamics on the millisecond timescale with measurements of nucleotide addition kinetics. These complimentary sources of data, NMR dynamics and fast kinetics, interpreted within the framework of the available crystal structures and others to be determined, will provide a clear structural and dynamic view of RdRp-catalyzed nucleic acid polymerization in RNA viruses. Comparison of two distantly related enzymes (from bacteriophage phi-12 and poliovirus) will allow generalization to a broad class of viral RdRps. In addition to dynamics, protein-protein interactions within polymerase complexes exert higher order control over the activity of their constituent RdRps. Modifications in these interactions lead to altered RdRp function, and in extreme cases to non-infectious viruses. The proposed studies will define these regulatory interactions in the context of phi-12 that contains a simple 4-protein polymerase complex. The results obtained will be generalizable to more complex RNA viruses.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry."

As rhetorics and policies of separateness have been superseded by discourses of multicultural unity and equality, so too ethnically-inflected and gendered social distinctions between town, township, and village have been eroded by a national culture now developing in, and emanating from, the urban centers. The aim of this research is to locate emergent forms of urban speech which mediate shifting linguistic and social identities, ethnic and national, in Bophuthatswana, a former ""ethnic homeland."" The urban speech variety in question derives from two kinds of language, and mediates two kinds of identity for black South Africans. In areas of North-West Province which were formerly part of Bophuthatswana, ethnic identity cleaves to Setswana, a standardized (and now nationally-recognized) language which is nonetheless socially moribund in urban communities. South African identity, on the other hand, cleaves to Tsotsitaal, formerly a criminal argot with roots in the urban townships. Tsotsitaal's evolution into an urban variety of Setswana, which is increasingly a medium of urban national culture, is the focus of this study. It will be investigated in terms of the gendered nature of shifting social boundaries in South Africa's urban communities. Research on Tswana peoples' speech behavior and language ideologies will consist of participant observation, recording of unelicited ""natural"" conversation, informal interviews, and archival study. By developing (1) linguistic descriptions of speech variation and the structural relationship of Urban Setswana to Standard Setswana, and (2) a historical/ ethnographic account of forces shaping the communities in which this variation is found, it becomes possible to (3) reach broader conclusions about language's role in mediating social identities an d political change."

Human systems interact with ""natural"" systems directly through the extraction and disposal of material, water, and energy resources and indirectly through changes in land use and land cover. These interactions are concentrated and magnified in urban areas. Human-dominated socioecological systems often are characterized by complex patterns of resource flows and landscape alteration, processes that can be difficult to track, quantify, and link to ecological impacts as a result of the multiple entry and exit points through which resources may pass, the rapid pace of growth in many urban areas, and the general difficulty in obtaining representative data. In this light, the ""big island"" of Hawai'i provides a model setting to test theories about human impacts on the earth system and about resource constraints on urban growth. Resource management issues are of critical concern for the island of Hawai'i, which holds only a ten-day reserve of food supplies and maintains the highest electricity rates in the country. By focusing on the island's two major urban areas, Hilo and Kailua-Kona, this interdisciplinary research project will provide a comparative analysis of the structure and function of two socioecological systems related through resource exchanges, geographic proximity, and historical and contemporary cultural configurations. Although similar in population and area, these areas have markedly different socioeconomic and biophysical characteristics. In recent years, Hilo has struggled with the demise of the sugarcane industry and the transition from a plantation economy to a more diversified base, while Kailua-Kona has experienced explosive growth fueled by its attractiveness as an international tourist and second-home destination. Based on the island of Hawai'i's clear physical boundaries, limited number of entry points, relatively small geographic area, biological wealth and fragility, and relative isolation, the Hilo and Kailua-Kona provide a comprehensible living laboratory for the two principal objectives of this project, which are (1) to analyze the material, water, and energy throughput of these two urban areas quantitatively over the past 200 years; and (2) to analyze past, present, and potential human-induced landscape change in these areas geospatially. Material and energy flow analysis, a tool drawn from industrial ecology, will be used to track the input, output, conversion, and accumulation of materials, energy, and selected substances through each urban system. Land-use and land-cover dynamics will be analyzed by coupling remote satellite imagery, statistical demographic data, and biophysical data for both cities. Information and data for these objectives will be collected from historical archives, statistical databases, and a number of stakeholders, including county agencies, local businesses, and community members. <br/><br/>An understanding of resource flows and landscape modification has the potential to transform the ways in which society interacts with the ""natural"" world by explicitly measuring the ways in which the activities of human society affect ecosystems and the ways in which ecosystem changes produce feedback in the human system. Essential to this process is the linkage of scientific findings with local communities and their particular sustainability challenges. With two locally embedded partners devoted to science education in Hawai'i, this project will be a platform for developing awareness of the issues faced on the island of Hawai'i by providing cross-disciplinary and multi-cultural educational initiatives for a diverse group of local and national students, teachers, and decision makers. In addition to informing policies that encourage ecological and socioeconomic prosperity, this project will also contribute to the advancement of socioecological and land-change science theories by applying a novel, comparative approach to the quantitative analysis of human-nature interactions.

Students are recruited to this REU program through poster and electronic mailings to more than 400 institutions and through the program's web site. Of the 68 students supported by the prior REU grant to Clarkson, 53% were women and 10% African Americans or from Puerto Rico. Only 12 of the 68 students were Clarkson undergraduates; the remaining 56 came from schools spanning the US, from Connecticut to California. Results from the analysis of pre- and post-surveys indicate that the program provides the students with an appreciation of research and that most participants decide to pursue graduate education.

Over a fifteen year period, 20 of 74 control loss airplane crashes were due to icing on aircraft wings. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that deicing costs US airports approximately $500,000,000 each year. Surfaces that eliminate or reduce the amount of ice formed on airplane wings and control surfaces could make aviation safer and less expensive. This work explores a technique using hydrophobic (water-repellant) and hydrophilic (water-loving) coatings to change surface properties and prevent the formation of ice. Already, it has been shown that these hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces delay surface freezing by twenty times that of normal, metal surfaces. It is necessary to better understand why this works in order to make even better surfaces which resist icing. Since frost formation is a common experience for people living in cooler climates, it is an excellent project for K-12 activities. This work includes educational outreach efforts with the Multicultural Engineering Program at Kansas State University, in outreach programs for underrepresented groups in middle school, high school, and undergraduate students, as well creating demonstrations and labs at the Kansas Children's Discovery Center for children ages 5-9. <br/><br/>Currently, most research in frost mitigation is focused on superhydrophobic surfaces which can decrease the temperature required for frost formation and increase the required freezing time. However, the mitigation effects of these surfaces can be extremely sensitive to experimental conditions and surface structure. The objective of this work is to investigate the potential of surfaces with mixed hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions to mitigate and control frost formation. On a mixed wettability surface, frost will preferentially form on hydrophilic areas, due to the lower energy barrier required for nucleation. Therefore, by selectively patterning a surface with various wettabilities, the size, shape, and location of frost nucleation can be controlled. The hypothesis is that controlling frost nucleation will not only affect the nucleation temperature and freezing time but also the density, growth rate, and structure of frost. Surfaces will be tested under varying quiescent and flow conditions using environmental chambers at Kansas State University. The surface will be cooled with a Peltier cooler. A confocal microscope will be used to obtain 3-D images, with 1 micron resolution, of frost nucleation and growth. The results obtained will lead to the formulation of relationships to predict the frost formation behavior as a function of the hydrophilic spot size and orientation. These relationships will be used to update models for designing more sophisticated frost mitigating surfaces. Additionally, preliminary results have shown that surfaces with mixed wettability significantly increase the time required for condensed droplets to freeze on the surface compared to a hydrophobic surfaces. This may be due to the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface changing the orientation of water molecules near the surface, requiring the input of additional energy to reorient the molecules into the desired crystalline structure.

The project will target three different groups of student participants in the basic and intermediate college algebra sequence, as well as in one group of participants in a three-year middle school mathematics sequence. College level achievement will be measured by the Elementary Algebra Skills test; the Stanford Achievement Test will measure achievement on the middle school level. Attitude toward math will be measured by the Revised Mathematics Attitude Scale. Teams of mathematics and English faculty investigators, and their female students, from a large, urban two-year college and participating middle schools from a large, urban public school system will create an academic community through the use of the college's electronic bulletin board. The project will intervene at the two critical points that hinder girls staying with and succeeding at mathematics and hence, women successfully pursing mathematics-based careers and reaching higher income levels: lack of achievement and poor attitude. Transactional writing can be an instrument in the construction of knowledge and the reshaping of beliefs. Writing about math helps students more easily learn mathematical concepts. Students from middle schools and a community college will use a technique called transactional writing to make them active learners. This, along with mentoring and career counseling, will help them become more interesting in math and science careers. *** 9555817 Fontaine Elizabeth City State University and five rural, economically disadvantaged, predominately African-American public school systems will implement a comprehensive regional project, entitled the Dr. C.D.

This project provides a concerted effort to comprehensively dissect the gene regulatory networks that target the metabolism of maize phenolic compounds, such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids, of fundamental agricultural importance. This study combines the discovery of novel transcription factors (TFs) that control maize phenolic accumulation, with the identification of their interaction partners and of direct target genes for individual and TF combinations. The investigation of allelic TF preference to gene regulation will provide insights that will be applicable to grasses irrespective of ploidy level. The evolutionary conservation/divergence of identified TF-DNA complexes will be evaluated in other grasses, providing an unparalleled understanding of how evolution impacted plant gene regulatory systems, and resulting in knowledge directly applicable to cereal breeding. Together with the generation of a comprehensive and centralized maize transcription factor open reading frame (ORF) collection and antibodies to several regulatory proteins, these studies will significantly advance understanding of the regulation and evolution of one of the most important plant metabolic pathways in plants. The resources generated will be useful in accelerating the study of the regulation of other important metabolic and developmental pathways in maize and other grasses. The deployment of the data here generated through the Web-accessible knowledge base GRASSIUS (www.grassius.org) and MaizeGDB (www.maizegdb.org) will continue to ensure that the findings derived from this project will have the broadest possible dissemination.<br/><br/>This project integrates genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematics, and bioinformatics for the comparative transcriptional genomics of phenolic compounds in grass crops.

We focus on the level of an Independent System Operator (ISO) as a natural level for control and security assessment, as it has emerged after energy system deregulation.<br/><br/>Our program consists of three components: 1) power system component, centered at Northeastern University, 2) environmental component, centered at Syracuse University, and 3) market component, centered at Temple University. Specifically, we plan to explore use of modern convex optimization and equilibrium methods in improving security aspects of generator scheduling on the ISO level and to perform detailed (hourly) generator plant simulations. Results of these simulations will be used in environmental models to assess effects of variations in plant loadings on the environment in the Northeast. The results of environmental studies will be fed back to power system models used to assess the sensitivities of the ISO operation to possible regulatory and policy changes. The program includes an integral educational component, built around undergraduate and graduate student internships at our industrial partners, course development and outreach. The project team includes industrial partners (ISO New England) who will serve as technical advisors and as a host to our students, and provide realistic test cases for all models involved.<br/><br/>In terms of intellectual merit, this program has several features distinguishing it from existing activities, as it: 1) provides for systematic links among power system, electricity market, and environmental modeling tools; 2) provides for much needed sensitivity studies with respect to inevitable model uncertainties, changes in economic and emergency response policies; and 3) includes undergraduate and graduate students in the same project at the same host organization. The project will establish new links with methods for describing uncertainty in robust control theory, and develop procedures for guaranteeing compatibility among models used in various domains (power systems, economics, environmental engineering). The project organization includes participation of Deans at all three sites, while remaining flexible and responsive to the evolving needs of the project.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impact, this project will develop a model of research coordination among three distinct research areas (power engineering, regulatory economics, and environmental engineering) that are closely coupled in issues like ISO system efficiency and security. It will allow for reexamination of modeling assumptions and practices in each area given the insight from the other two, thus enabling a better flow of ideas and people. We also plan to build on the track record of all three institutions in attracting and retaining students coming from under-represented groups, and the Director of multicultural engineering programs at Northeastern will coordinate this effort. Educational benefits of the program include development of courses and teaching material, outreach activities involving undergraduate students, and training of PhD students who will be uniquely positioned for productive work in the areas of energy processing systems, environmental engineering and regulatory economics."

An underlying theme is controlling the location, alignment and packing of nanorods to optimize targeted properties. The work to be undertaken during this project involves <br/>(1) orienting gold nanorods in homopolymer thin films and lamellar block copolymer films that confine the nanorods, and measuring their polarization dependent optical properties; <br/>(2) applying thermodynamic principles to design systems that incorporate and align gold nanorods within cylindrical domains of block copolymers, and then studying nanorod induced phase transformations in block copolymer morphologies; and <br/>(3) investigating unique nanorods including TiO2, silica with a gold nanoshell and Janus nanorod systems to explore how rod diameter, surface functionality, and biphasic surfaces direct the location of nanorods in block copolymers. <br/>A successful outcome of the proposed research will be precise control over assembly of functional nanorods in polymer films using spatial confinement. As a proof of concept, a nanorod/polymer device will be fabricated and its polarization-dependent optical properties tested to demonstrate that these coating can be used as color polarizing filters. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) are utilized in applications ranging from sports (golf balls) to transportation (tires) because they combine materials with synergistic properties. Presently, PNCs are attracting interest for information storage as well as electronic and energy applications. The proposed research will provide scientists with the rules for selecting the materials that will lead to optimum efficiency in PNCs. The broader impacts include laboratory experience for middle and high school students, high school teachers and undergraduates including those from underrepresented groups. An annual science day for middle school students (6th ? 8th grade) will continue at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition, female elementary school students are introduced to a summer camp called Girls in Engineering Math & Science Camp (GEMS).

Future plans include extending the course from one to two sections, developing laboratories, exposing students to new characterization tools, and facilitating joint research projects. The first materials science textbook aimed at high school students is also planned. Because CHS draws academically talented, multicultural and diverse (32% African American, 5% Latino, 50% female) students, this partnership will have a profound and lasting impact on the scientific and technological literacy of underrepresented groups."

To address the discontinuous nature of power generation from these renewable energy sources, an efficient and cost-effective means of energy storage device needs to be integrated with them. Regenerative fuel cells, particularly those capturing CO2 with H2O to produce formic acid, have been suggested. Thus, by combining the CO2 electrochemical reduction process with direct formic acid fuel cells, the prospects for future energy systems based on non-fossil energy sources are apparent. However, the reality is that the technology does not work so well and the promise goes unfulfilled.<br/><br/>PIs Su Ha and Louis Scudiero of Washington State University, and Sheng Dai of the University of Tennessee Knoxville ascribe the shortfall to the catalyst in the formic acid fuel cell. They point out that the existing anode electrocatalyst is Pd, and the cell performance is prevented from reaching its full potential by promotion of the undesired reaction pathways for formation of surface poisoning species. Improvement of the fuel cell catalyst could be had through bimetallic catalyst design. However progress is limited by the lack of understanding of how the various transition-metals used as supports influence the catalytic performance of supported Pd. It is proposed that improved catalyst selectivity will be had from catalysts made by coating transition-metals centers with a Pd shell in the core/shell structure. They intend to make these catalysts for test.<br/><br/> By treating the preparations to characterization of the surface electronic structure, chemical properties and catalytic performance for formic-acid oxidation, the current understanding will be improved upon. Based on the improved understanding of the bimetallic effect, one should be able to design superior bimetallic catalysts that increase the specific activity and inhibit further the undesired reaction pathways in formic acid oxidation. These superior bimetallic catalysts can be used to develop high efficiency regenerative DFAFC systems which make tractable the issue of intermittent power from renewable energy sources. <br/><br/>The success of the proposed research activities has the potential for broad societal impact because it leads to high performance and stable regenerative formic acid fuel cell systems. Such a system can capture CO2 and convert it into a fuel that is consumed in the fuel cell to produce electrical energy. <br/>The PIs have plans for disseminating this new knowledge to those outside the scientific community. At the Palouse Discovery Science Center, the PIs and graduate students will demonstrate the scientific principle of regenerative fuel cell technology to increase middle and high school students interest in pursuing science and engineering degrees. Furthermore, the PIs will disseminate the research findings to high school classrooms by continuously participating in the NSF funded Research Experiences for Teacher (RET) program at Washington State University. Undergraduate students will be given an opportunity to experience the latest fuel cell and renewable energy technologies using several in-class and out-of-class approaches, including building formic acid fuel cells for the national Chem-E-Car Competition. The PIs will actively involve the undergraduate students, especially females and underrepresented males at WSU and University of Tennessee into the proposed research activities. At WSU, this will be accomplished by working directly with the director of the Office of Multicultural Student Services."

Nitroxide-based initiators bearing polar or fluorophilic functionalities (perfluoroalkyl and polysiloxane groups) on the nitroxide moiety will be synthesized. During polymerization this nitroxide moiety will be used to control the partitioning of the growing polymer in super-critical carbon dioxide, such that both monomer and alkoxyamine initiator are initially soluble but the polymer precipitates at a critical degree of polymerization. The addition of a stabilizer will permit control of the final particle size. The development of polymeric alkoxyamines that possess dual initiator and stabilizer capabilities for dispersion NMRP in super-critical carbon dioxide will be explored. Thermal or pH-responsive polymers will be developed for applications such as drug-delivery, non-viral gene vectors and surface coatings for cell manipulations. These designed materials will be examined in biocompatibility studies, complexation studies with DNA, as well as plasmid transfection levels using different cell lines. The broader impacts include training graduate students and enhancing infrastructure for research and education through the establishment of a trilateral international collaboration. The synergistic interactions between the American, Irish and Spanish groups will further broaden the training of these students, introducing a multicultural enrichment while promoting learning, teaching and training of young scientists in an international, collaborative environment. <br/><br/><br/>This project will provide further scientific understanding about using green polymerization conditions for industrial synthesis. Carbon dioxide is a ubiquitous atmospheric gas, and its use as a solvent for plastic material manufacturing could lead to a reduction in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. The project would also further our understanding of the basic design principles for polymers used in biomedical applications."

A systemic approach K-12 has been designed by the school district and its partners to improve the quality and quantity of science and mathematics education received by minority students; to increase the number of minority students enrolling in and successfully completing higher level precollege science, engineering and math courses; and to increase the number of students who go on to pursue undergraduate studies in science, math, engineering, and technology (SMET), especially minority students who are significantly underrepresented in these fields. The Board of Education has unanimously adopted a resolution that embraces the CPMSA mission, promotes the philosophy for science and math as defined in the Goals 2000 Educate America Act, and commits existing resources to achieve these goals within the next five years and to sustain these efforts thereafter. the framework for the school district's model for systemic reform consists of four essential characteristics: core elements, supporting mechanisms, connecting activities, and transitional experiences for students, teachers, and parents. These will be delivered through three coordinated and integrated systems which function year round: The SMET Student Academy; The Teacher Institute; and The Parent Community Center. These entities will provide multiple pathways to attain the goal orientation needed for success in school, at work, and in life. To excite, encourage, enlist and meet the needs of student, a series of core math and science Readiness and Preparedness Courses, as well as a variety of enrichment opportunities will permeate the system. Programs such as Dial-a- Teacher, Homework Hotline, Face-to-Face Tutoring, project Adventure, Young Saturdays, Study Skills courses, SAT/ACT Pre p courses, College Saturdays and Weekends will offer students continuous support. Transitional experiences will be provided for student s at three levels: SMET Summer Camps, modeled after our 1995 NSF-funded Summer Science Camp, will provide transitional experiences at two levels, from elementary to middle and from middle to high school; a College Bridge program will help extend the pipeline from high school to college. A critical component of each transitional experience is the connection it will make to the SMET industries through field trips, shadowing, mentoring, and internship opportunities. The primary goal of the Teacher Institute is to develop and strengthen the capacity of teachers for teaching SMET courses in a multicultural setting an to alter the way that teaching, learning, and assessment take place through staff development courses based upon the latest educational research and taught under the leadership of the faculty at New York University. A unique aspect of the Teacher Institute will be the SMET Fellows Program, a 4-6 week summer internship. Parents will be actively engaged in the Parent Community Center.

The PI proposes to restructure the sequence of required mathematics courses for elementary school preservice teachers in order to develop mathematical thinking through problem solving situations on a variety of topics which make connections to other disciplines. The courses will be designed to develop positive belief systems about the nature of mathematic and the process of learning and teaching mathematics. A major component of the course are school-based experiences in multicultural settings with master teachers who have studied mathematics through inservice programs with the PI. The schools in the project are heavily populated with minorities, primarily Blacks and Hispanics. Students will observe in the schools and analyze in the college classroom video recordings of school mathematics classes. Teachers will help to develop the program, in particular the problem solving episodes, and they will serve on the project's advisory board. The project will also serve the needs of preservice teachers who have deficient mathematics backgrounds and would have to take remedial courses before entering the elementary mathematics course sequence. Instead, these students will be allowed to take the new courses and will be given additional help which will enhance their mathematical skills and attitudes. Since at least 50% of the preservice students in the remedial track are minority students, the program will address the issue of equal access for all. The project staff will also work with the new teachers throughout their first year of teaching, with weekly support meetings in which they will receive additional preparation. The materials developed for the project will be three distinct sets: a problem set with discussions and explanations for the preservice teachers; a similar set for the inservice teacher with additional pedagogical insights and assessments components as well as problems for children; and a complete set of materials for college instructors with references to mathematics education research. Initially, the materials will be disseminated at cost through NCTM and the University. Eventually, a publisher will make materials available commercially.

The project has four major components: one the recruitment and retention of minority students who are interested in becoming specialists in the teaching of science to young children; two the revision of thirteen science and education courses in the elementary school teacher preparation program and general science major; three the development of field placements in elementary school science classrooms that have substantial minority enrollments; and four the dissemination of information on such a model science program for future elementary school teachers. In addition to serving the 270 currently enrolled preservice teachers, this program will target fifteen newly admitted minority students per year, who will have been given full scholarships by the institution. In order to improve the retention rate of these students, the project will also develop a number of support programs such as the Summer Vestibule Program, special tutoring opportunities, mentorships, and multicultural sensitization seminars."

While pattern classification has shown promise in many areas of practical significance, it faces difficult challenges posed by real world problems, of which the most pronounced is the so-called curse of dimensionality: that is, the fact that the sample size required to perform accurate prediction on problems with high dimensionality is beyond feasibility. The goal of this project is to develop novel classification and clustering techniques to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and to reduce bias by estimating feature relevance and selecting features accordingly. In particular, this project has the following specific, measurable objectives: (1) to develop non-linear and flexible metrics for distance-based classifiers via kernel methods; (2) to construct effective ensembles by exploiting local feature relevance to perform adaptive sampling in feature space, and (3) to develop adaptive metrics for subspace clustering by measuring local correlation of data with respect to different dimensions.<br/><br/>Given that so many problems of practical interest are high dimensional, this research will have significant impact in fields and applications as diverse as bioinformatics, security and intrusion detection, information and image retrieval. The PI's collaborative effort with biologists for the analysis of microarray data has the potential to contribute new data mining techniques to the HIV genomic knowledge domain, which in turn could eventually contribute to the customized diagnosis and treatment of AIDS.<br/><br/>This project involves the training of both undergraduate and graduate students and includes a joint seminar course with the Department of Molecular Biology at George Mason University. The PI aims to facilitate the involvement of underrepresented groups in the science and engineering fields through her active participation in training activities and workshops in cooperation with the Multicultural Research Center at George Mason University."

This project will annually involve about 200 students who are science majors and 500 general education students. The goals are to increase retention of majors and the scientific literacy of non-majors. Courses will be offered in a highly visual, user-friendly, computer-based learning environment that is interactive, powerful and intuitive. Language barriers are less of a problem in an interactive environment utilizing pictures, animations, sounds, graphs, words and numbers where science can be seen, heard and explored. More fully engaging students in thinking and problem solving will allow them to learn better. Also, techniques, concepts and demonstrations which are too expensive, dangerous or do not lend themselves to traditional modes of instruction can be taught despite pedagogical obstacles.

We focus on the level of an Independent System Operator (ISO) as a natural level for control and security assessment, as it has emerged after energy system deregulation.<br/><br/>Our program consists of three components: 1) power system component, centered at Northeastern University, 2) environmental component, centered at Syracuse University, and 3) market component, centered at Temple University. Specifically, we plan to explore use of modern convex optimization and equilibrium methods in improving security aspects of generator scheduling on the ISO level and to perform detailed (hourly) generator plant simulations. Results of these simulations will be used in environmental models to assess effects of variations in plant loadings on the environment in the Northeast. The results of environmental studies will be fed back to power system models used to assess the sensitivities of the ISO operation to possible regulatory and policy changes. The program includes an integral educational component, built around undergraduate and graduate student internships at our industrial partners, course development and outreach. The project team includes industrial partners (ISO New England) who will serve as technical advisors and as a host to our students, and provide realistic test cases for all models involved.<br/><br/>In terms of intellectual merit, this program has several features distinguishing it from existing activities, as it: 1) provides for systematic links among power system, electricity market, and environmental modeling tools; 2) provides for much needed sensitivity studies with respect to inevitable model uncertainties, changes in economic and emergency response policies; and 3) includes undergraduate and graduate students in the same project at the same host organization. The project will establish new links with methods for describing uncertainty in robust control theory, and develop procedures for guaranteeing compatibility among models used in various domains (power systems, economics, environmental engineering). The project organization includes participation of Deans at all three sites, while remaining flexible and responsive to the evolving needs of the project.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impact, this project will develop a model of research coordination among three distinct research areas (power engineering, regulatory economics, and environmental engineering) that are closely coupled in issues like ISO system efficiency and security. It will allow for reexamination of modeling assumptions and practices in each area given the insight from the other two, thus enabling a better flow of ideas and people. We also plan to build on the track record of all three institutions in attracting and retaining students coming from under-represented groups, and the Director of multicultural engineering programs at Northeastern will coordinate this effort. Educational benefits of the program include development of courses and teaching material, outreach activities involving undergraduate students, and training of PhD students who will be uniquely positioned for productive work in the areas of energy processing systems, environmental engineering and regulatory economics."

Age-old disputes over land, water, religious and cultural practices fuel intolerance. Children absorb the ambiance, culture and attitudes of their community. Consequently, cycles of intolerance pass from generation to generation. But there is some hope for change: research has shown that sharing personal experiences can change attitudes. When it comes to developing tolerance, early intervention is best. The multicultural education literature highlights the effectiveness of children interacting with children from other cultural groups, as well as reading children's literature from other cultures. The aim of this project is to develop technology and social structures needed for children who speak different languages to learn with and from each other in a digital community setting centered on children's books. The PIs will address two closely linked technical challenges. The first is the design of child-friendly user interfaces to support online interaction and communication between children; this will be addressed via cooperative inquiry, in which design teams (including researchers and child participants) gather field data, initiate ideas, and test and develop new prototypes. The second is the problem of translation; this will be addressed by involving the communicating children themselves as collaborative participants in an innovative approach to developing language technology resources that support cross-language communication without full-scale machine translation. A combination of methods will be used to evaluate the proposed research. Data to be gathered in classrooms will include understanding changes in how children from different cultures use new technologies to communicate, interpret stories, develop collaborative narratives, and see other cultures. This research will leverage the ongoing NSF ITR-funded International Children's Digital Library (ICDL), with which the PIs are involved, in order to provide access to books that create common ground for children's ""ICDL communities."" This project will add value to ICDL by contributing technologies that give children who speak different languages an opportunity to interact. The intellectual merit of this research includes: new interfaces that enable children who speak different languages to communicate safely with each other in ways that are comfortable for them; advances in translation technology; and evaluation of the impact of children's experiences in ICDL communities. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The broad impacts deriving from this research include two significant contributions: a model online community using technology to advance the cause of tolerance and understanding; and a technology test-bed that will be made available to the scientific community in order to lower the barriers to entry for further development of cross-cultural online communities for children and adults."

Change creates stress with which people need to cope, and they often turn to others for advice, information, and understanding. Social support has long been known to promote psychological health and to protect against the adverse health effects of stress. Yet, in conceptualizing social support, researchers have inadvertently adopted a Western definition that emphasizes explicit efforts to extract or provide help or comfort. The proposed research builds on several preliminary studies showing that Asians and Asian-Americans are significantly less likely than European-Americans to seek such explicit social support for coping with stress, because their social relations may be disrupted by so doing. Using multiple methodologies, such as survey and physiological measures, the proposed studies will examine the use of explicit versus implicit social support (which we define as drawing on the awareness and/or company of supportive others without explicitly requesting or receiving support vis-a-vis a specific stressful event) and explore cultural differences in their use and physiological/psychological impact on managing stress. The intellectual merit of the proposed research stems from its ability to 1) broaden our conceptual understanding of social support by exploring the stress-reducing benefits of implicit as well as explicit social support and 2) broaden our understanding of cultural differences in how social support is extracted, experienced, and utilized to reduce adverse physiological and emotional responses to stress. The broader impact of the work stems from its challenge to existing Western conceptualizations of social support and its potential to enlighten the social support experiences of currently under-represented populations. As such, it has the ability to inform social support interventions with multicultural populations."

Scientific researchers have established that efforts to contain disease are highly variable depending on how different groups of people perceive their vulnerability. Perceptions of risk and stigma can vary considerably between different cultural, linguistic and cultural settings. This project proposes to explore how ideas about stigma and risk evolve in the context of communities impacted by Ebola. The project has the potential to inform public health debates about how to improve human response to mobile health threats, while promoting public safety to reduce the threat of transmission.<br/><br/>Drs. Smith-Morris, medical anthropologist, and Dr. Faith Nibbs, cultural anthropologist, both Dallas residents with ongoing research in affected Dallas neighborhoods, have a unique vantage point from which to compare neighborhood-level experience of this infectious disease, and the experiences of stigma by residents of different socioeconomic class, ethnic and linguistic mix, and culture. The project addresses two key questions. First, how is human behavior changing in response to heavy media coverage of the three Dallas Ebola cases, and the neighborhoods from which those victims emerged? And second, are there cultural patterns in the way that people change their behaviors, both individually and collectively in neighborhoods, to manage risk and stigma, or to share and respond to educational materials about Ebola? Drawing upon stigma scales that have proven effective in comparable mental and public health contexts, the researchers will adapt the prompts to include questions specific to Ebola. The researchers will then follow up with more in-depth interviews that examine the Ebola and stigma, information tracing, and the impact of the Ebola crisis on resources and actions. Quantitative and qualitative data from surveys, interviews, media analysis, and participant observation within the two communities under study will be catalogued and analyzed with concordance software widely recommended for corpus-based methods. The results are expected to create a better understanding of crisis management patterns in urban, multi-cultural neighborhoods, so that future public health and education strategies may be more efficient and more effective."

These proteins have a characteristic signature domain comprising two histidine-containing motifs separated by an intermotif region of variable length. This domain consists of six beta strands within a conserved B-barrel structure. While most cupins contain a single cupin domain, a significant number of proteins belonging to this family are bicupins, containing two pairs of motifs. Although some cupins have known functions and have been characterized at the biochemical level, the majority of these proteins are known only from gene cloning or sequencing projects. Several members of the cupin superfamily have been shown to use oxygen as a substrate or cofactor, including flavonol 2,3-dioxygenase. This enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the heterocyclic ring of flavonols to yield carbon monoxide and the corresponding depside, play a role in the degradation of flavonols by fungi and other microorganisms. This unusual transformation involves the cleavage of two C-C bonds with the release of CO. To date, two flavonol 2,3-dioxygenases have been characterized, although an increasing number of hypothetical proteins from a large number of organisms whose genome have been sequenced share high sequence homology to these enzymes. Structural, spectroscopic and mechanistic studies are proposed for the Bacillus subtilis flavonol 2,3-dioxygenase. This enzyme has been chosen as a model system for the study of the metal-binding selectivity in members of the cupin superfamily to elucidate how variations in metal cofactors influence the reactivity of the catalytic center for O2 binding and activation.<br/>Intellectual Merit:The long-term goal of this research is the understanding of the interrelation between protein structure, function and evolution in metalloenzymes, utilizing members of the cupin superfamily as model systems. Most enzymes belonging to this superfamily require a metal ion for activity, and the conserved residues at the cupin motif (3His and 1Glu) provide an optimal metal binding environment in the characteristic double barrel B-helix structural motif. The contribution of conformational plasticity of the cupin scaffold to the choice of substrate and metal ion is currently unclear and the enzyme flavonol 2,3 dioxygenase represents an excellent model system for the study of the relationship between metal ion and enzyme activity. In addition, this enzyme, as a bicupin, also serves as a model for the study of the role of gene duplication in members of this superfamily.<br/>Broader Impacts: This research provides an excellent opportunity for the education of graduate and advanced undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary and multicultural research environment under the guidance of the PI, a member of an underrepresented group actively involved in the mentoring of minority students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The PI will encourage the participation of undergraduate students for the duration of this project. Emphasis will be given to the recruitment of underrepresented minority students with the involvement of NSF supported LSAMP and AGEP programs base at the PI's institution. In addition, graduate students will be provided the opportunity for training in spectroscopic techniques not currently available at the PIs institution through collaboration with an international group."

This program will provide doctoral students in engineering and forest resources with the tools and insights required to balance the technological, environmental, and social dimensions of a sustainable energy economy. The underlying research theme is the development and field testing of new life cycle assessment (LCA) tools to forecast the impact of research innovations on the sustainability of a commercialized bio-energy product. Forest resource-based energy products will be emphasized because forests are important economic and cultural drivers for our program partners at the Yakama Nation and the Quinault Indian Nation. IGERT trainees will use the new LCA methods to forecast the sustainability implications of innovations from their dissertation research. A year-long tailored curriculum will expose Ph.D. student participants to forest management, energy and environmental issues, and Native American philosophies. In their second year, each doctoral student cohort will design a sustainable energy and resource management process or product that addresses development needs in the Native American partner communities. Students will visit the reservations to discuss energy development issues with community stakeholders, after which they will evaluate technical and resource management options, and perform LCA to identify a sustainable design that address community needs. Students will then use these experiences to teach an undergraduate design course that incorporates realistic economic, environmental, and cultural constraints. IGERT trainees will continue to participate in technology review panels to provide feedback on the designs generated by subsequent doctoral cohorts. This research and educational program will be coupled with a recruitment and retention effort to enhance the doctoral participation of underrepresented groups, especially Native Americans/Native Alaskans, in engineering and forest resource studies. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries."

Specifically, the project will investigate the role of inferred major hydrological disturbances during a time span of ca. 800 years in local and regional cultural processes from an interdisciplinary perspective.<br/><br/>Previous paleonvironmental reconstructions in the central Andes indicate the occurrence of extraordinary and prolonged droughts and floods during the Middle Horizon (MH, ca. AD 550-1000) and Late Intermediate Period (LIP, ca. 1000-1470). These phenomena would have compelled people to develop appropriate adaptive responses and, in some cases, differentially accelerated cultural change. Thus, it has been hypothesized that rapid population nucleation and/or site abandonment episodes on the central coast would reflect crucial accommodations to hydrologic upheavals. However, serious voids still undermine understanding of the referred natural-cultural processes. Particularly, the region lacks reliable relative and absolute chronologies; systematic studies of local paleoenvironmental history and processes have barely started. In addition, excessive focus on one culture-one period impedes an assessment of links between paleoenvironmental variation and short and long-term human responses. Cajamarquilla provides an excellent setting to address these concerns because of its economically strategic but hazardous location and relatively well preserved multicultural occupation over MH and LIP, including associated canals and inferred reservoirs and storage facilities. <br/><br/>To test the primary hypothesis that severe environmental fluctuations conditioned the foundation, abandonment, and reoccupation of Cajamarquilla during the MH and LIP, Mr. Segura will conduct the following: (1) collection of radiocarbon samples to refine occupational history vis--vis the postulated natural phenomena; (2) analysis of sedimentary deposits (including thin section microscopy analysis) and microbotanic remains (pollen grains, starch grains and phytoliths) from natural and cultural features, such as bank exposures of a nearby dry water course, abandoned canals and reservoirs, and house floors; (3) assessment of the structural and functional characteristics of selected canals, reservoirs and storage pits; and (4) characterization of abandonment and architectural reconstruction events vis--vis signatures of destructive flooding or severe water shortage. <br/><br/>This research will have a broader impact beyond the research topics presented. Firstly, it will improve knowledge and appreciation of potential risk in an area historically impacted by floods and droughts, especially in the context of global warming. This will be relevant for preventive measures and urban planning as modern populations live on ancient channels around the site and elsewhere in the world. Second, because of its focus on combined cultural and natural data, the project will foster synergetic international collaboration of professionals and students representing different disciplines that will enhance their skills as well as their own disciplinary and cross-disciplinary knowledge and appreciation. Finally, the research will enrich and disseminate our knowledge of Cajamarquilla, one of the only two still-preserved large urban sites on the central coast. This will enhance future protection of the site against uncontrolled modern urban growth."

The model builder will combine the abundant experimental data on individual molecule interactions and the current models of transcriptional regulation mechanisms into a single model that can simulate all the molecular interactions along the DNA. The visualization tool will utilize assorted graphical methods (including animations, charts, and graphs) to facilitate the understanding of the random nature of the different mechanisms used by the cell to regulate transcription. And finally, the teaching interface will merge the simulation and visualization components to provide students, educators, and scientists with the ability to experiment, explore, and discover how different regulation mechanisms combine to achieve specific cellular responses. These tools will aid students and researchers in understanding the stochastic and dynamic nature of transcriptional regulation and allow exploration of the effects of perturbation on different regulation mechanisms. <br/><br/>This project promotes interdisciplinary research and training among faculty and students in computer science, molecular biology, and mathematical modeling. The work integrates into existing simulation based educational initiatives and educational outreach activities on the University of Colorado campus.

However, this research does not adequately address how OA effects to individuals are linked across trophic levels. Pelagic copepods are critical players in most marine biogeochemical cycles. Their consumption of phytoplankton and microzooplankton is the primary mechanism by which bacterial and phytoplankton production is transferred to higher trophic levels. Despite their high abundance and ecological importance, copepods have received little research attention concerning OA. The few studies focused on direct acute effects to copepods (e.g. egg hatching, survival) under elevated pCO2, and few significant effects have been observed at predicted future pCO2. However, there is increasing recognition that OA significantly affects their phytoplankton prey, including elevating growth rates, increasing cell sizes, altering nutrient uptake and ratios, and chemical composition. Because copepod grazing, egg production, and hatching success all can vary with these prey characteristics, OA mediated changes in phytoplankton quality may be an important indirect mechanism through which OA acts on copepod populations and, ultimately, marine food webs. <br/><br/>This study that will advance our understanding of how copepod populations may be affected by OA, specifically through OA induced changes in phytoplankton quality. The core objective of this study is to determine how changes in phytoplankton physiology and biochemistry (e.g. lipid composition) affect copepod egg production, hatching, and ontogenetic development of nauplii. The PIs will include a subset of experiments to test whether OA affects copepod reproductive output independent of changes to prey. To achieve these research goals, the diatom, Ditylum brightwellii, and dinoflagellate, Prorocentrum micans, will be cultured semi-continuously under several pCO2 concentrations, during which time the investigators will characterize changes in their physiology and biochemistry. The copepods, Calanus pacificus, a large, high lipid-bearing marine species, and Acartia clausi, a smaller, low lipid-bearing estuarine species, will be maintained across varying pCO2 concentrations and fed these pCO2-acclimated prey, and their grazing and reproductive capability quantified. The copepods and phytoplankton used in this study will be collected from the Salish Sea, a region already experiencing periods of high pCO2/H+ (>1000 ppm, pH 7.5) on varying timescales. Therefore, this research addresses a question of how future climate change may impact marine ecosystems, but also is relevant to pCO2/H+ variability presently experienced in coastal environments. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The PIs of this project are committed to: 1) promoting access to under-represented groups, 2) training and mentoring, 3) broadening knowledge of OA and 4) developing infrastructure for ongoing, multidisciplinary OA research. Under-represented groups will be served through Shannon Point Marine Center's (SPMC) nationally recognized NSF-funded Multicultural Initiative in the Marine Sciences: Undergraduate Participation (MIMSUP: http://www.wwu.edu/mimsup/), and University of Washington's Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PNW LSAMP) programs. Educational goals are addressed through an array of activities including K-12 outreach, research experiences for undergraduates, including SPMC's summer REU program, and development of widely disseminated curricular materials. The project will support and participate in SPMC?s public outreach initiative, increasing awareness of marine issues in the general public. This study will support three early career scientists, a public education outreach specialist, and will train a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student. Infrastructure improvements to SPMC's existing OA research facility will increase usability, making it more accessible for classroom use and student research. The additional instrumentation will also allow the facility to become a regional resource for monitoring pCO2 in the Salish Sea."

The two foci of these research activities are to (1) use parallel atomistic simulation to characterize the complex interactions between lattice dislocations and special grain boundaries in gold and nickel nanowires, and (2) measure the strength, ductility and strain-rate sensitivity of gold and nickel nanowires with controlled microstructures and grain size using applied electrochemical methods and atomic force microscopy. This would enable the PI to prove both theoretically and experimentally that special grain boundaries such as twin boundaries can dramatically improve these properties in nanowires. The intellectual merit lies in the presentation of a combined experimental/modeling research approach harnessing the power of both atomistic simulation and atomic force microscopy. This combination of methodologies will be very successful in bridging the gap between experiment and modeling in the mechanical characterization of individual nano-building block materials. Another potential outcome of such approach can be to rapidly help establish new standard methods and calibration procedures to test nanowires, as well-defined as nanoindentation technique for thin films, open up new research areas and lead to more findings. The research is also expected to show new ways to fabricate nanorods and nanowires with specific defects that make them stronger. NON-TECHNICAL: The educational component of this 5-year plan is strongly integrated to the multidisciplinary research program. The PI will make major educational and outreach contributions at the University of Vermont (UVM) to (1) spearhead the effort of revising the graduate engineering program with a focus on Multiscale Systems and Modeling; (2) structure international student exchanges with eight European engineering-specific programs at undergraduate level via the existing International Student Exchange Program (ISEP); and (3) develop a vigorous outreach program, via a novel scientific imaging which cross-cuts with the photographic arts, to improve the recruitment in engineering of students from rural high schools in Northern Vermont and the Abenaki Indian tribe in the Missisquoi Valley community.

The University of Washington 3DL Partnership, a collaboration between the College of Education and School of Social Work, together with the University of Washington Undergraduate Academic Affairs' Dream Project, will partner on this effort with Neighborhood House, a community organization that has served Seattle and King County's low-income, immigrant and refugee communities since 1906. <br/><br/>Building on a robust, existing program, Youth Empowered with Leadership Strength (YELS), new YELS STEM programming will take place in two cohorts - a middle school cohort and a high school cohort. Each cohort will experience 120 hours of programming time, which includes mentoring through the University of Washington Dream Project, a Making and Tinkering Studio, and exposure to a multicultural STEM curriculum designed to increase awareness of the role of people of color in the STEM workforce. A formative assessment will explore the strengths and weaknesses of the program on a yearly basis in order to modify and improve it on the ground. A summative evaluation component will study the effects of STEM enhancements on youths' knowledge of STEM careers and higher education opportunities, interests and motivation to pursue STEM learning, and identification with STEM disciplines. Embedding this project in a wrap-around community organization with a long history of serving community needs will ensure long-term sustainability.<br/><br/>The proposed activities use innovative programming methods to increase opportunities in STEM learning for underserved youths of color. These methods will be widely disseminated locally, nationally, and internationally through practice, research and policy channels to provide knowledge for similarly planned efforts in other settings. This study will involve 116 youths in intensive YELS STEM programs and will build understanding of STEM learning and STEM careers within the community through Neighborhood House public events. Findings from this study will help develop programs to increase the diversity of the STEM workforce."

This shift has produced tensions as multicultural nation-states consolidate neoliberal forms of governance and simultaneously face increasing demands for collective rights and autonomy from ethnic groups. This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist from the University of Texas at Austin will examine the Zapatista Army of National Liberation's movement for autonomy and indigenous rights in Chiapas, Mexico by comparing two communities in Zapatista-run autonomous townships in the Canadas region, which have strong variations in levels of gender equity and women's participation. Through the ethnographic methods of household surveys, oral histories, semi-structured interviews, participant observation and archival research, this project will investigate the historical construction of these differences and will analyze the relationship between gender and autonomy. The study will focus on the ways in which gender equity has positively and negatively affected the practice and consolidation of autonomy and will contribute to the theorization of indigenous women's organizing. The study will also assess the impact of gendered state responses on this process. <br/> Broader Impacts: By advancing understanding of the relationship between demands for individual rights, such as women's rights, and for collective rights within indigenous movements, the research findings will be of use to academics, policy-makers, and indigenous organizations as they search for peaceful ways to resolve conflicts.

This project addresses how states in the Americas have approached the issue of land rights. Internal threats to the state's territorial control and targeted international pressure stimulate executive action with state strategic interests being the crucial mediating factor to explain the patterns. This research project is designed to explain why the implementation of ethnic land rights varies by examining closely the cases of Brazil, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The research involves fieldwork on-site, including the construction of nation-wide databases for ethnic land claims and resulting government decisions, original experimental data on political elites' attitudes on the implementation question, archival documentation, and in-depth interviews of state elites and non-elites, experts, and practitioners in ethnic land claims.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits are associated with the project's theoretical and empirical advances in the study of state control over territory. Because ethnic collectivities are often minorities that claim vast tracts of sparsely populated lands rich in energy, mineral, and natural resources, scholars and policy makers have pointed to competing economic interests, low administrative capacity of the state, or insufficient socialization of state elites as factors that impinge on the implementation of ethnic land rights. This project advances this discussion by seriously considering the mediating effect of state interest and power in shaping the implementation of multicultural legal principles in the Americas. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the projects are two: providing insights useful to international and national policymakers to improve policy implementation strategies and producing original observational and experimental data on ethnic land rights implementation. The data collected will help assess the geographic patterns of ethnic land rights implementation over time and the effects of key policy decisions on the ground. The findings should enhance national security by clarifying how states can develop secure borders and territories."

Traditionally, nodes in distributed systems deviate from their specification because they are broken (e.g., because of bugs, hardware failures, configuration errors, or even malicious attacks). MAD systems add a new dimension: without a central administrator ensuring that each unbroken node follows the assigned protocol, nodes may deviate to selfishly maximize their utility.<br/><br/>Byzantine Fault Tolerance handles broken nodes well. However, the Byzantine model classifies all deviations as faults and requires a bound on the number of faults that is impossible to establish when nodes can be selfish. Conversely, traditional game-theoretic models handle selfish nodes well, but are vulnerable to arbitrary disruptions if even one broken node behaves irrationally.<br/><br/>The goal of the FuDiCo III international workshop, held from June 4th to June 7th 2007, is to identify the conceptual and practical foundations on which to build dependable MAD distributed systems.

As organizations attempt to simultaneously become leaner and more flexible, this creates a need to create teams that cross divisional boundaries in a context where there are fewer people to buffer communications across functions. The academic literature, as well as corporate experience indicates that direct face-to-face inputs from people different than ourselves is faster, cheaper and of higher knowledge quality than classic technology transfer. Thus, multiteam situations are a natural response to the competitive pressures faced by many organizations. Still, although multiteam systems have the potential to solve many problems related to both routine operations and innovations solutions, they also create unique issues and conditions that require special attention to boundary spanning relationships both within and between highly specialized teams. The large number of members within a typical multiteam system, along with the specialized nature of their knowledge base, makes it impossible for every member to fruitfully talk to each and every other member, thus dictating a formal network of boundary spanners within the multiteam system. However, the large size and specialization associated with multiteam systems also creates more potential for Simmelian ties the emergence of informal boundary spanners outside the formal network. These additional informal ties can either reinforce are undermine the formal structure and the research proposed here will develop new theory and provide new data that seeks to improve our understanding of the interplay of formal and informal networks on processes and performance in multiteam systems.<br/><br/>This project will study these phenomena at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University, a facility that is a state of the art complex for studying high particle physics and is at the forefront of the competitive world of scientific discovery and knowledge expansion. In addition, the composition of its workforce, which is a multicultural representation of top researchers from all over the world, serves as vivid manifestation of the challenges faced by modern multinational organizations trying to leverage their human knowledge capital. The FRIB is structured as a set of multiteam systems linked by boundary spanners and the needs for inter-team knowledge sharing trigger both a planned formal ties as well as ad hoc informal ties. Using in-depth interviews, surveys, and network analysis protocols, this project examines the positive and negative aspects of informal third-party ties and how these are influenced by individual characteristics, dyadic relational characteristics and team attributes related to structure and leadership."

This project meets the requirements for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) because it constitutes preliminary work on untested and novel ideas. Specifically, it proposes to explore the idea that science fiction influences the career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers, a notion for which anecdotal support can be mobilized yet which has never been substantiated through empirical research. This pilot study will serve as the foundation for a larger proposal for an NSF Scholars Award to conduct follow-up research on the relationship between technoscience and science fiction. This project emerges at the intersection of the fields of science and technology studies (STS) and library and information science (LIS), and seeks to explore how exposure to science fiction influences the career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. In so doing, it merges the theoretical strand of the social shaping of technoscience from the STS literature with work on mass media in the life of the reader/listener/viewer/visitor/player from the field of LIS. The project is made possible by the hybrid expertise of the PI, whose Ph.D. is in STS and whose current faculty position is in LIS, and who has previously conducted NSF-funded research projects on the ethical implications of values embedded in information technologies such as dissection simulations and computational models. This project will allow the PI to further his research agenda at the intersection of the fields of STS and LIS, and to conduct research that will make significant contributions to both fields. The three primary objectives of this study are to develop a more robust understanding of the relationship between technoscience and society, mass media, and science fiction. This study hypothesizes that the career choices and research decisions of scientists and engineers are influenced by science fictionas well as other mass media and social factors as a whole. Data collection includes ten semi-structured, open-ended interviews with scientists and engineers. Interview data will be analyzed using grounded theory such that research findings will be continuously integrated to further refine the research design, leading to the construction of a theory that can provide a preliminary explanation how society, mass media, and science fiction influence scientists and engineers and which can be tested and refined through additional research. Results will be disseminated via academic conferences and peer-reviewed journals.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This study will contribute to the STS literature by exploring the social factors that influence the career decisions and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. The contribution to the LIS literature will be detailed exploration of the relationship between technoscience and mass media through an in-depth case study of mass media in the lives of scientists and engineers as readers/listeners/viewers/visitors/players. Finally, this study will also contribute to the literature on the relationship between technoscience and science fiction by exploring if and how science fiction might influence the career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This study also aims to produce broader impacts that focus on the recruitment and retention of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students. First, by improving understanding of how science fiction shapes the career choices of scientists and engineers, educators will be able to determine when and how to use science fiction to promote student interest in STEM, potentially reinforcing and legitimating existing educational programs. In addition, this study may also be able to provide insights into how science fiction can promote diversity among STEM students, through emphasis on female and non-white authors and characters and feminist and multicultural themes. Finally, this study may discover ways that science fiction can help students majoring in STEM to become more conscious of the social and cultural dimensions of science and technology."

Systems capable of converting text from one language into another have the potential to transform how diverse individuals and organizations communicate. Despite recent successes, we see two critical impediments to continued progress in translation technology: (1) the development of systems depends on access to large amounts of data, and the growth of available resources has far outpaced increases in the performance of individual computers; and (2) current systems for the most part do not take the context of what they are translating into account. With few exceptions, systems translate sentence by sentence, and do not differentiate whether the input text is a newswire article or a children's book. This project advances the state of the art in SMT by addressing both issues. Since divide-and-conquer techniques running on multiple processors are currently the only practical solutions to large-data problems, we must develop scalable algorithms that can exploit large computer clusters. MapReduce is an attractive framework for tackling these challenges since it hides low-level distributed processing issues such as synchronization, fault tolerance, etc., allowing the researcher to focus on actually solving the problem. By coupling network analysis with cross-language information retrieval techniques, we can build rich, multilingual contextual models that will guide an SMT system in translating different types of text. We focus on cross-language enrichment of Wikipedia as an application for demonstrating this technology. Although Wikipedia has emerged as a valuable repository of human knowledge, it has yet to transcend the language barrier. For the most part, contributors work in silos defined by languages, without the benefit of knowledge that is being accumulated elsewhere. The potential broader impact of this project is no less than knowledge dissemination across language boundaries, which will serve to enrich the lives of all the world's citizens."

Austin, will conduct an Advanced Studies Institute on ?Hands-on Research in Complex Systems? at the University of Buea, Buea Cameroon, for two weeks in July-August 2010.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The ten faculty will be eminent scientists from the U.S. who have conducted frontier research using tabletop instrumentation and who have published their results in journals such as Nature, Science, and Physical Review Letters along with their partners from Cameroon and other African countries. They will be assisted by ten U.S. advanced graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The unique focus of the ASI will be on hands-on laboratory experiments using inexpensive instrumentation leading to frontier scientific advances in understanding complex systems. The laboratory sessions will be complemented by associated mathematical modeling using the software Scilab (which is similar to Matlab), which is available for download, free of charge. The primary goal of the ASI is to develop collaborations for scientific research with African nations. The ASI participants will be advanced graduate students and young scientists and engineers from developing countries in Africa (and a few participants from developing countries elsewhere). The U.S. faculty will benefit by making lasting contacts with scientists from developing countries. The ASI is sponsored partly by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy; ICTP will provide travel funding for participants from developing nations and administrative support for advertising the school and selecting the participants. The ASI will be co-sponsored by the Ministry of Higher Education of Cameroon, and will be held at the University of Buea which will provide laboratories and lecture rooms for Hands-On Research sessions as well as lodging and meals for all participants from Africa and participating countries.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Participants from the U.S. and developing countries will work closely together conducting experiments and developing mathematical models. The senior faculty and their assistants (whose participation will be made possible by the support of this grant) will lead the hands-on sessions that are the centerpiece of the ASI. These interactions will naturally lead to long term collaborations and exchanges of personnel. The junior faculty (U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral associates) will benefit not only from the interactions with peers who will become leaders in science and technology in developing nations, but also the school will provide the junior faculty with a unique opportunity to hone their own teaching and leadership skills in a unique multi-cultural environment. The senior faculty will present lectures and tutorials on the experiments and numerical modeling. Table-top experiments are particularly well suited for scientific research in developing countries where resources are limited. The interactive sessions will provide a learning experience for faculty as well as the participants, as we all work together to observe phenomena, explore concepts, and raise questions that warrant further study. Our experience as directors of a Hands-On Research on Complex Systems meeting, held in India in January 2008, was that many participants have reported that their participation was a life-changing experience. Building on our experience in India and responding to the suggestions and criticisms of the participants there, we expect that the Hands-On Research on Complex Systems ASI in Cameroon to have lasting impact on the scientific careers of the faculty as well as the school participants."

Using direct assessments, previous research has shown that children evaluate racial exclusion as wrong using moral reasons in straightforward situations (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, & Stangor, 2002). In complex or ambiguous situations, children often use a mixture of reasons, such as group functioning or personal choice to justify exclusion. The present studies will examine the ways in which children display implicit and explicit racial biases. Studies with adults have shown that while explicit biases have diminished dramatically over 50 years, implicit biases are still quite prevalent (Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986). Most of this research has not employed measurements that are developmentally appropriate for children; nor do they assess bias in the context of peer situations. Pilot work for the present study established the reliability and validity of two assessments for investigating implicit racial bias in children using ambiguous pictures cards and perceptions of similarity measurements. These instruments will be used in the present investigation to assess children's evaluations of contexts involving cross-race peer relationships. Using the social-cognitive domain model, this research will investigate whether and how children apply racial biases to their interpretations of ambiguous picture cards with cross-race peer dyads, to their perceptions of similarity, and to their judgments about the potential for cross-race friendships. In this assessment, social encounters are depicted that reflect everyday, familiar, social contexts for children, such as situations on the playground, at the park, and in the school yard. In addition, this research will examine how the ethnic make-up of children's school environments influences the extent to which children apply racial biases to decisions about peer relationships. Further, children's implicit and explicit bias will be examined in order to understand whether children who do not demonstrate explicit bias, nonetheless, exhibit implicit biases when asked to make judgments about peer relationships.<br/>This research will investigate whether, and how, children take race into account when making decisions about peer encounters in morally-relevant peer relationship contexts. One study will focus primarily on implicit biases from children attending different schools (homogeneous and heterogeneous), and a second study will use multiple measures to understand the relationships between implicit and explicit intergroup judgments. Given that previous work has shown that different forms of social reasoning are used when evaluating peer contexts, this research will seek to determine if racial biases are brought into consideration when evaluating peer exchanges, guided by developmental social-cognitive domain theory. <br/>The knowledge resulting from this project will enable educators, school psychologists, and school professionals to develop curriculum and intervention programs to address issues of intergroup tensions, and diversity in schools in a developmentally meaningful way. Given the multicultural nature of the workforce and adult world, it is essential to facilitate children's ability to interact comfortably with individuals from diverse backgrounds; a first step towards this goal is understanding when and how children's intergroup biases manifest in various social contexts and situations, and that is the central aim of this investigation."

The physiology that permits these animals to sustain extended breath-hold periods and survive the extreme pressure of diving deep allows them to thrive in icy Antarctic waters. Key elements of their physiological specializations to breath-hold diving are their ability for remarkable adjustment of their heart and blood vessel system, coordinating blood pressure and flow to specific body regions based on their metabolic requirements, and their ability to sustain periods without oxygen. Identifying the details of these strategies has tremendous potential to better inform human medicine, helping us to develop novel therapies for cardiovascular trauma (e.g. stroke, heart attack) and diseases associated with blunted oxygen delivery to tissues (e.g. pneumonia, sepsis, or cancer). The goal of this project is to document specific genes that control these cardiovascular adjustments in seals, and to compare their abundance and activity with humans. Specifically, the investigators will study a signaling pathway that coordinates local blood flow. They will also use tissue samples to generate cultured cells from Weddell seals that can be used to study the molecular effects of low oxygen conditions in the laboratory. The project will further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. The project will train a pre-veterinary student researcher will conduct public outreach via a center for community health improvement, a multicultural affairs office, and a public aquarium. <br/><br/>The goal of this study is to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the dive response. A hallmark of the dive response is tissue-specific vascular system regulation, likely resulting from variation in both nerve inputs and in production of local signaling molecules produced by blood vessel cells. The investigators will use emerging genomic information to begin to unravel the genetics underlying redistribution of the circulation during diving. They will also directly test the hypothesis that modifications in the signaling system prevent local blood vessel changes under low oxygen conditions, thereby allowing the centrally mediated diving reflex to override local physiological responses and to control the constriction of blood vessel walls in Weddell seals. They will perform RNA-sequencing of Weddell seal tissues and use the resulting sequence, along with information from other mammals such as dog, to obtain a full annotation (identifying all genes based on named features of reference genomes) of the existing genome assembly for the Weddell seal, facilitating comparative and species-specific genomic research. They will also generate a Weddell seal pluripotent stem cell line which should be a valuable research tool for cell biologists, molecular biologists and physiologists that will allow them to further test their hypotheses. It is expected that the proposed studies will advance our knowledge of the biochemical and physiological adaptations that allow the Weddell seal to thrive in the Antarctic environment."

Presently, individuals of non-European American backgrounds comprised approximately 36% of the American workforce, and by 2050, these workers will be responsible for 85% of its growth. There is a striking lack of ethnic diversity, however, among leaders in all sectors of the American economy. For example, although Asian Americans are the most highly represented minority group in academic settings (comprising 6.2% of faculty), and have the highest percentage of college degrees of any ethnic group, they hold only 2.4% of top administrative positions in higher education, compared to African Americans (9.4%) and Latino Americans (3.6%). This disparity, and similar ones observed in business and political settings, have been cited as evidence of a ""bamboo ceiling,"" or limit to career advancement for Asian Americans. What factors might be responsible for the bamboo ceiling and other barriers to advancement for different ethnic minority groups? <br/><br/>Various scholars have argued that these barriers are due to racial discrimination and stereotyping. In the current project, Jeanne Tsai (Stanford University) and colleagues propose that European American employers may unknowingly engage in ""affective discrimination,"" or discrimination based on a cultural mismatch between the emotional ideals (""ideal affect"") of European American employers and their ethnic minority employees. Affective discrimination may be less obvious than other types of discrimination because people are often unaware of how their cultures shape their emotions, and because the emotion-based judgments that people make about others often occur quickly, automatically, and outside conscious awareness. In previous work, Tsai and colleagues found that whereas North American cultures value excitement, enthusiasm, and other ""high arousal positive"" states more, East Asian cultures value calm, peacefulness, and other ""low arousal positive"" states more. Thus, consistent with their ideals, European American employers may seek to promote excited and enthusiastic leaders, which may inadvertently disadvantage Asian Americans and other employees who value and therefore express other affective states. <br/><br/>The project will examine whether people's ideal affect influences their leadership judgments in different occupational settings (business and engineering) and under varying work conditions (periods of normality vs. periods of crisis), why biases occur (i.e., the underlying psychological mechanisms), and whether people can be taught to account for cultural and individual differences in ideal affect when judging others' potential for leadership. The project uniquely utilizes cross-cultural, experimental, and neuroimaging methods to capture these processes. Findings from this work will advance scientific understanding of how culture shapes the judgments people make about others based on emotional expression, and will advance methods for integrating neural, psychological, and cultural levels of analysis. This work also promises to identify ways of breaking down barriers to advancement for different ethnic groups in the U.S., and to develop methods of teaching members of all groups how to work together harmoniously in an increasingly multicultural society."

Bone loss is usually treated using autografts or allografts. Although they do have their benefits, each of these materials has a set of drawbacks which limit the extent of their use. With this in mind, the objective of this project is to use tissue engineering to create new scaffolds as practical and functional alternatives for bone replacement and regeneration. The new scaffolds will have a nanofibrous structure and be structurally similar to natural bone, containing both cortical and trabecular areas and microvascularization. To accomplish this task we will complete the following objectives: 1) Perform a finite element analysis to discover the nanofiber orientation necessary for the scaffold to bear the appropriate load. 2) Construct fully mineralized, porous, nanofibrous scaffolds for trabecular bone by combining techniques for nanofiber mineralization, pore creation, and sintering. 3) Creating cortical bone like structures with vascular channels using electrospinning techniques with microfibers and nanofiber mineralization. 4) Creating a full thickness, porous load bearing scaffold by combining the trabecular and cortical scaffolds with sintering techniques. The resulting structure will be engineered from mineralized poly (L-lactic acid) nanofibers and will be designed to withstand the forces experienced in load bearing bones while having enough porosity to allow for full thickness cellular and tissue infiltration. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>Although many studies have created scaffolds to replace bone, most of these seek to only replace trabecular bone. No currently available scaffold or technique seeks to mimic the structure and properties of both trabecular and cortical bone, including correctly placed vasculature. The creation of this scaffold would also lead to a solution to the problem of cell movement in nanofiber scaffolds. Typically the pores in nanofibrous scaffolds are too small to allow significant cellular infiltration. The method of micro-porous nanofibrous scaffold fabrication described in this project would solve this problem and could be used for the other tissue engineering applications. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The proposed research will advance the field of tissue engineering through the creation of nanofibrous scaffolds that do not hinder cell motility and the production of a full thickness bone graft. This research will provide an opportunity for many students to gain experience in experimental design, data analysis, engineering, and the ability to work in a group environment. Dr. Freeman is devoted to establishing outreach programs to recruit students from underrepresented groups into engineering and science. Currently, he mentors graduate students from all segments of underrepresentation. Since arriving at Virginia Tech over 2 years ago he has also mentioned 3 undergraduates of underrepresented groups.

About twenty faculty mentors, involved in six different research areas, are committed to work together in the UMEB program to achieve two main objectives: 1) recruit and retain talented students in environmental biology; and 2) prepare students for careers in environmental biology including entry into graduate programs. Northern Arizona University's UMEB program combines coursework, mentoring, individual research, and outreach activities. All scholars enroll in the UMEB seminar: Foundations of Research (ENV 499). During the first semester, students are introduced to all of the research mentors and the array of research opportunities from which to choose. At the end of fall semester each scholar selects his or her own mentor; and during the second semester, each one prepares a research prospectus based on his or her interest. Past experience has shown that retention of UMEB scholars is greatly enhanced by engaging four layers of support: program staff, mentors, peer support, and university services particularly suited to provide culturally sensitive support for students (Multicultural Student Center, Native American Student Services, and the Department of Applied Indigenous Studies). The theme of the UMEB program: ""melding science with traditional ways of knowing"" is based on experiences gained during the first UMEB program. Native American students are often challenged to find a balance between modern science and the wisdom of ages.

The research to be conducted includes design and synthesis of multifunctional composite materials (MCM) through incorporation of nano-reinforcements at both the interlaminar and intralaminar levels. The key principle will be to control the nanoparticle concentration, orientation and morphology through the thermo-hydroforming stamping process. The emphasis of the research would be on the development of fundamental materials-processing-property relationships that lead to polymer and composite multifunctional properties, particularly mechanical stiffness and toughness, reduced weight, thermal conductivity, dielectric properties, electrical conductivity, enhanced barrier performance, fire resistance and self-diagnostic capability. Examples of materials to be tested with the thermo-hydroforming press are (a) nanomaterial-reinforced composites, (b) engineered materials for RF devices, (c) tailorable materials and structures, (d) biobased structural composites, and (e) to shape-set and perforate thin nitinol shape memory alloy sheets for biomedical applications. <br/><br/>The thermo-hydroforming press will provide numerous educational and research opportunities for faculty, post-doc fellows, graduate and undergraduate researchers to learn more about forming of biobased composites, nanocomposites, and lightweight metals, as well as to verify the accuracy of existing material models and to develop new models for the forming simulation of nanocomposites. Through various workshops sponsored annually by the college of engineering, participation of first-generation, low-income and/or underrepresented college juniors and seniors in the thermo-hydroforming research will be encouraged. The multicultural apprenticeship program (MAP) will provide for the participation of underrepresented women high school students to learn more about career opportunities in biobased materials and nanotechnology. The new thermo-hydroforming press will also provide opportunities for local small businesses to have access to a research instrument. Finally, using summer workshops sponsored by the Society of Plastic Engineers (SPE), practicing engineers will be trained on the benefits of stamp thermo-hydroforming as a unique process for forming composite materials."

One class of aminomutases requires no co-factors to promote isomerization via heterolytic processes involving ionic reaction intermediates, while another requires multiple co-factors, homolytic processes, and radical intermediates. The phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) isolated from Taxus plants is among the set of mutases that lacks co-factor dependency, and the reaction sequence is likely initiated by action of a 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO) prosthetic group, derived by spontaneous cyclization of an ASG amino acid tandem in the active site. After transient removal of the NH3 and H+ from the substrate, these migratory elements are reattached to the phenylpropanoid with retention of configuration at the receiving carbons. The (3R)-configuration of the beta-amino product is opposite to that of the product made by the presumed mechanistically related tyrosine aminomutase (TAM) reaction at pre-equilibrium. The described retention of stereochemistry in the PAM reaction is uncommon, considering that all aminomutases for which the stereochemistry has been examined invert the configuration of carbon receiving the amine group. PAM also displays broad substrate specificity for ring-substituted beta-aryl- and beta-styryl-Alpha-alanines, and thus provides a potential source of unnatural beta-amino acids. Comparing the mechanisms and stereochemical fates of all the 2,3-aminomutases, PAM appears to sort it into a distinct sub-class based on its unique reaction processes. Thus, the long-range goal of this research project is to decipher the molecular and biochemical components of the determinants that govern the PAM mechanism. The specific objectives and timeframe follow: Yrs 1 and 2, assess requirement of the MIO prosthetic group for the function of phenylalanine aminomutase from Taxus sp. Site-specific mutagenesis of the ASG residues comprising the MIO, comparative kinetic assays between wild-type and mutant enzyme will be conducted. Yrs 2 and 3, determine catalytic base that removes the activated benzylic hydrogen. Interaction of the MIO with alpha-phenylalanine is hypothesized to lower the pKa and facilitate the removal of the benzylic hydrogens. Site-specific mutagenesis, comparative kinetics assays and isotopomers of (2S)-alpha-phenylalanine will be employed to address this aim. Yrs 3 and 4, establish the complete stereochemistry of the reverse reaction. The stereochemistry of the migratory hydrogen and amino group in the reverse reaction from (3R)-beta- to (2S)-alpha-phenylalanine is hypothesized to be consistent with that observed for the forward reaction, and will be examined with synthetically derived [2H]-labeled beta-phenylalanines. Yrs 4 and 5, assess kinetics of PAM mutants that have a less encumbered active site. Rational mutation of bulky aliphatic side chains to smaller groups in the PAM active site will be employed to increase active site volume, and the specificity of the mutants will be tested with variously 2', 3', and 4'-substituted aryl alpha-amino acids.<br/>Broader Impacts of activities: Educational: In addition to cross training a diverse, multicultural pool of graduate students, this project will integrate research and education through year-round opportunities for undergraduate students. Participants will assist in DNA informatics, biochemical analyses, in vitro assay development, chromatographic and mass spectrometry-based analytical chemistry, enzymology, and synthetic organic chemistry to prepare them for careers in academia and industry. Undergraduate participation and mentoring of ethnic majority and minority students will continue, and the PI continue to recruit students from his 2nd year Organic Chemistry course, which has been the source of previous undergraduate researchers (selected from a pool of the 1000 students). The ultimate goal is to provide fledgling scientists with necessary social context, personal integrity and responsibility to embolden their self-esteem, which provides a foundation of independent thinking and problem-solving skills in Science and Life. Scientific: The project will center on discovering the principles that govern substrate specificity of the Taxol pathway phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) isolated from Taxus spp. Knowledge of the catalytic amino acids and residues involved in substrate binding will hone our ability to predict and test hypotheses of enzymatic function. Understanding these key elements that participate in substrate/enzyme recognition will lay the groundwork to rationally design biocatalysts that can stereoselectively isomerize readily accessible alpha-amino acids to chiral beta-amino acids. The development of such biocatalysts, in vivo or in vitro, would minimize the need to use harmful and environmentally unfriendly solvents that are currently used in synthetic procedures. Ultimately, data on the molecular and structural elements that control substrate specificity will provide invaluable insight into the genetic and biochemical origins of what moderates the retention of NH3 and H+ in the MIO-dependent aminomutase reactions and loss of these groups from the closely related ammonia lyase reactions."

However, the isotopes we observe here on Earth comprise only a small fraction of those that are known to exist. Study of short-lived, or rare, isotopes is key to understanding the origin of matter in the universe, how neutrons and protons collectively form into atomic nuclei, and to explore fundamental symmetries of nature. As these rare isotopes are not naturally occurring on Earth, they must be created in powerful particle accelerators, such those at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), located on the campus of Michigan State University (MSU). There beams of rare isotopes are created at half the speed of light. However, some of the most precise experimental techniques for probing the properties of rare isotopes require beams with energies up to a billion times less than what they are created with at NSCL. These high-energy beams can be slowed using solid degraders and brought to rest in a chamber filled with a buffer gas, a technique currently in use at the NSCL. The development of a next-generation Advanced Cryogenic Gas Stopper (ACGS) will improve the efficiency and speed at which rare isotopes are delivered to experiments, expanding the reach of several experimental programs to even more exotic isotopes. It will benefit the user community of the NSF-funded NSCL and, through the scientific progress it enables, society at large. The project will follow NSCL and MSU policies for ensuring a diverse scientific workforce. A state-of-the-art development project like ACGS, with close ties to a leading research university that actively encourages and supports a multicultural research body, will create an optimal environment for under-represented and minority students to be trained as scientists.<br/><br/>The ACGS is a next-generation high-performance linear gas-stopping device for converting fast rare isotope beams into stopped beams that can be used directly or reaccelerated. The delivery of rare-isotope beams over a wide range of energies is necessary to maximize the number of experimental techniques that can be employed. Beams with energies of 0.01 to 100 keV are used in high-precision experiments with ion traps and lasers, to measure nuclear binding energies (masses), to determine nuclear radii and moments, and to test fundamental symmetries at levels complementing much more expensive high-energy experiments. Precision beams of rare isotopes with energies of 0.1 to 20 MeV/u are used to measure cross sections of key reactions that are critical for understanding nuclear synthesis in the cosmos and for nuclear reaction studies that help determine detailed nuclear properties needed for further advances in nuclear theory. After installation at the NSCL, the ACGS will provide high-purity beams with high efficiency, with short extraction times to provide access to short-lived isotopes, and with a high beam rate capability to enable world-class science, in particular with reaccelerated beams. Fast beams provided by NSCL's Coupled Cyclotron Facility will be slowed down in solid degraders prior to being stopped in helium gas inside the ACGS. The thermalized ions are then guided to an extraction orifice using RF ion transport techniques and a low-energy, so called ""stopped"" beam is formed. The design is tailored to allow the ACGS to accept incident beam rates exceeding 10^8/s. A novel electrode design, compared to existing linear gas stoppers, will provide an order of magnitude higher beam rate capability and cryogenic operation guarantees delivery of clean rare isotope beams. The use of novel RF-carpet ion-transport techniques will provide extraction times as short as ten milliseconds. The ACGS is best suited for the stopping of medium-to-heavy-mass isotopes that have relatively narrow range straggling distributions in the helium gas and will constitute a high-performance complement to the light-ion Cyclotron Stopper already being built at the NSCL. The availability of intense stopped and reaccelerated beams of short-lived isotopes will play a critical role in the future research program at the NSCL and will be a key feature of research at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) under construction at MSU."

The project is funding 29 scholarships over 5 years: 9 of these are graduating from the 9th semester Teacher Preparation Program (Noyce Scholars) and 20 are graduating from the 5th Year Master of Arts in Teaching Program (Noyce MAT Scholars). In this project, Colorado College is collaborating with Colorado Springs School District 11 and Harrison School District 2. The goal of the project is to develop high-quality, culturally-conscious science and mathematics teachers. To achieve that goal, the project is creating a community of undergraduate Noyce STEM Interns who develop a sense of self-efficacy for teaching diverse learners and consider teaching science or mathematics as a career. To further support the goal, the curriculum is infused with the practice of culturally relevant pedagogy to prepare the teachers-in-training for the high-need schools in which they will work. The project also includes a newly-designed teacher induction program, with an integrated mentoring program, to help teachers thrive in the environment of high-need schools. <br/><br/>The PI team has identified four barriers to recruitment, preparation, and retention of high-quality teachers and has developed strategies to address them. The first barrier is exposure of STEM educators to culturally diverse teaching experiences. To address this barrier, the PI team is providing 20 STEM freshmen and sophomores in summer internships that focus both on culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) and research methods and analysis. The strategy to address the lack of appropriate preparation for CRP is to integrate the principles of CRP into the teacher education curriculum. To overcome the barrier of staffing and retaining qualified STEM teachers in high-need schools, the project is combining the financial incentive of the scholarships with a rigorous clinical experience that links educational theory on multicultural education with pedagogical practice and long-term teacher professional development. To overcome the barrier of retaining thriving STEM teachers in high-need schools, the project is developing a two-year induction program that includes mentoring and intentional engagement to prevent teacher burnout. The project is being evaluated using demographic data, grades and graduation rates, lesson plan analysis, and, through surveys, student perceptions. The data collected will inform teacher preparation program nationwide in best practices to recruit, prepare and retain culturally relevant teachers for under-resourced schools."

Our REU program, the Introductory Multicultural Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (IM-SURE) Program is administered through the Division of Biological Sciences. IM-SURE is primarily intended for undergraduate students (including college-bound high school graduates) nationwide who are interested in environmental biology, but have had little or no research experience to date. Each student will conduct original hands-on research under the guidance of a faculty member and her/his research group. Major areas of research include microbial ecology, plant ecology, and ecological and evolutionary genetics. Students will be matched with a research mentor and project based on their interests, skills, and experience. Projects will be designed to help students develop their research skills and independence, as well as their knowledge of a specific area of environmental biology. REU researchers may be placed on the UM campus (or associated field sites), at UM?s Flathead Lake Biological Station, or, for select students with some prior experience, at our partner institution in Chihuahua, Mexico (along with a UM mentor). Students will gain experience in a variety of aspects of scientific research, such as formulating research questions and hypotheses; designing experiments; analyzing data; and communicating research results. Initial orientation, midsummer social activities, and capstone meetings of the entire group will offer opportunities for IM-SURE students to share their experience and develop a sense of scientific community. We seek to provide a collegial and supportive environment for all participants and measure our success and student satisfaction and accomplishments through the national REU Assessment Tool (URSSA) and our own brief surveys. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of their research experience. IM-SURE participants are selected based on academic record, personal interest statement, research experience essay (although prior experience is not required), and two reference letters.

This project will result in the development and field demonstration of a modular prototype ""E-tongue"" probe. This E-tongue probe will facilitate accurate, rapid, and cost-effective detection and quantification of heavy metals and have a direct impact on improving health and safety of humans. Standard spectro-analytical methods are expensive, bulky and require trained personnel for operation. The E-Tongue probe has the following unique features and advantages over existing laboratory and portable technologies, including: a) Portability and robustness, enabling rapid on-site testing; b) High sensitivity to detect multiple toxic metal ions below EPA specified maximum contamination limits; c) Integrated pH and temperature sensor for additional data and improved accuracy; d) User-friendly; and e) Low cost. By ascertaining levels of heavy metal contaminants at sites with sufficient accuracy in real-time, the E-Tongue probe can assist engineers to make onsite decisions, such as determining optimum locations for placement of monitoring wells, identifying hot-spots for sample collection for detailed laboratory testing, and adjusting field activity to control remediation options. It will also provide regulatory agencies with critical information so that they can take appropriate steps such as communicating drinking water advisories in a timely manner. <br/><br/>The project will result in the creation of a field deployable prototype E-tongue probe comprising an electrochemical sensor array, data acquisition/control and intelligent pattern recognition software. To develop the prototype, and move from research discovery to commercial application, the project will address the following technology gaps: 1) Simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, 2) Interfering compounds and electrode fouling, 3) Effects of temperature and pH, 4) Sampling challenges in the monitoring well and sediment testing systems. These technology gaps will be overcome by the use of multiple modified electrodes to enhance selectivity and sensitivity, elimination of interference and fouling through the use of appropriate sampling electrolytes and electrode protection strategies, integration of pH and temperature sensors to compensate for variations in pH and temperature, and incorporation of automated sampling systems. This project will provide the investigators, postdoctoral researcher and graduate student, the experience in transforming novel discoveries into prototype devices to solve real-world problems, as well as interdisciplinary, multicultural, global entrepreneurship experience through the Manning School of Business ""Global Entrepreneurship and Innovation"" program. <br/><br/>Geoprobe and K2 Engineering will partner in manufacturing the prototype E-Tongue probe and princed circuit board (PCB) fabrication and assembly of the miniature potentiostat.

Such aminal radicals are used to create new carbon-carbon bonds in molecules containing heteroatoms, such as pharmaceuticals and natural products. The use of these radicals allows efficient syntheses of target molecules while avoiding acid-base chemistry of nitrogen, and as such represents a new strategy for chemical synthesis."

Categorical variables that summarize this type of survey data are called multiple response (or pick any/c) categorical variables. It is often of interest to test for independence between two categorical variables. When categorical variables can have multiple responses, traditional Pearson chi-square tests for independence should not be used because of the within-subject dependence among responses. This research will provide methods to test for independence between two or more multiple-response categorical variables. A modified version of the Pearson statistic will perform the test, and bootstrap procedures will provide approximate sampling distributions. First and second-order corrections will allow for chi-square distribution approximations to the sampling distribution. Generalized log linear models and multivariate binomial logit-normal models will provide a model-based approach for the test of independence. <br/><br/>Many survey questions are asked in a multiple-response manner. Examples include: ""What types of cars do you own?"" and ""For what criminal offenses have you been arrested?"" Other questions naturally fall into a multiple-response format, but some researchers avoid asking them in this format due to statistical analysis problems. For example, most survey questions dealing with ethnicity allow respondents to make only one choice, which is entirely inappropriate in today's highly multicultural population. Other researchers may analyze multiple-response questions as if they came from single-response categorical variables, which can lead to very conservative tests of independence. This research will allow researchers to incorporate these types of questions into surveys and use statistically correct methods of analysis. The research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies under the Research on Survey and Statistical Methodology Funding Opportunity."

The past communities will be reconstructed using shellfish remains found abundantly at or around the surface in coastal habitats. Also, the project will assess fossilization potential (probability of preservation) of major types of marine animals, with primary focus on shellfish. Using coastal habitats of the Outer Banks (North Carolina, USA), marine communities will be assessed quantitatively in terms of several major groups of animals important both in commercial and scientific terms. The targeted field area has been selected because of the presence of abundant and diverse marine animals (both live and dead), including benthic mollusks, echinoids, arthropods, annelids, and brachiopods. We will sample multiple sites to carry out quantitative comparisons of living organisms and dead shellfish remains. The project should generate a dataset of ~20,000 specimens representing ~200 samples of living and/or dead organisms.<br/>Two primary goals motivate this study. First goal is to quantify differences between live communities and dead shellfish accumulations in order to provide data that will allow us to interpret more reliably ecological information preserved in the fossil record (shellfish is a dominant type of organisms preserved as fossils). Namely, to develop more rigorous understanding of environmental and ecological changes recorded in the fossil record, it is necessary to determine whether death assemblages can provide meaningful estimates of biodiversity, faunal composition, and other aspects of living communities. Second, a rigorous understanding of long-term ecosystem changes in areas inhabited by present-day shellfish communities is critical for assessing human impacts on marine life. Namely, systematic sampling of extant, ecologically understood, and often economically important shellfish should contribute direct data for assessing human impacts on coastal ecosystems. This, in turn, should result in a more informed evaluation of environmental -- and, ultimately, societal -- consequences of our diverse activities in coastal areas (from industry to tourism) and improved guidelines for developing sustainable approaches to human uses of coastal areas.<br/>This project will offer a venue for training a post-doctoral researcher in integrating disparate data and developing transferable skills in paleontology, marine sciences, and statistical methods. In addition funding has been allocated for undergraduate student internships to be recruited from underrepresented minority groups (with assistance from the on-campus Department of Multicultural Programs and Services). These undergraduates will receive hands-on field experience and will be involved in science educational/outreach activities, which will also allow them to develop competitive portfolios for pursuing graduate education. Numerous undergraduate educational and research opportunities will also be provided by this project, including datasets suitable for developing laboratory exercise in introductory and advanced courses in natural sciences. This proposal will support one female post-doctoral researcher and initiate collaboration between Virginia Tech and Duke University Marine Laboratory. Popular online venues will be used to involve the public in an interactive manner."

The graduate students from other countries, supported by the organizations such as KOSEF/SISTeC in Korea, JST in Japan, NNSFC in China, and DST/IUSSTF in India, will also participate in these summer schools. The summer schools are organized to provide advanced training to graduate students in a multicultural and multidisciplinary learning environment to produce next generation of experts to create and design smart structures. The environment exposes the students to a broad knowledge frontier that does not currently exist. New education and mentoring paradigms are discovered during the summer school teaching and learning experiences.<br/><br/>One of the engineering challenges is the design and construction of smart structures. However, civil engineering graduate students are only exposed in a limited way to the wide range of other disciplines that make up smart structures technology. Seamless interaction between the fields of structural dynamics, control systems, circuit technology, wireless technology, bio-sensing, and informatics is required for successful applications. Additionally, some of the most advanced research and its applications are occurring overseas, which makes it difficult to access easily.

Because the current code provisions for wind loads are based on the reduction of many wind tunnel observations into a few numbers, the question arises as to what constitutes a proper wind tunnel simulation of the flow in the atmospheric surface layer and associated wind loads on low-rise structures and what procedures should be followed in translating pressure coefficients as measured in these simulations to full scale applications. The objective of the proposed research is to determine whether generic wind tunnel simulations of low-rise structures can predict wind loads under hurricane conditions. This will be achieved by contrasting full scale peak pressure and wind load coefficients measured during recent hurricane seasons with model scale measurements with the same probability of non-exceedence. The comparison will be based on a probabilistic procedure that will be employed to obtain the distribution of peak pressure and load coefficients from single sample records. Different methods will be implemented and compared to determine the parameters of the probability distribution function of the peaks. The different limiting factors, including effects of turbulence intensity and differences between open and suburban terrain exposures, will also be addressed. The recent measurements conducted in Florida provide a unique database that can be used to assess the reliability of simulated wind loads. The proposed effort provides a probabilistic approach for contrasting full and model scale pressure and wind load coefficients. This approach redefines a peak wind load as measured in a single record by associating a non-exceedence probability with its value. The intellectual merit of this project is that it will enable a better comparison of field data with data from wind tunnel simulations. With respect to broader impacts, the proposed research will contribute to a more reliable prediction of wind loads and thus to the goal of reducing losses due to wind damage. The project team will work with the Institute for Business and Home Safety, a non-profit U.S. corporation established to support research and promote construction techniques for loss reduction from natural hazards. The project team will also work with the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program (MAOP) at Virginia Tech to enable involvement by undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in this wind research."

Stable hemostatic clots are designed to arrest bleeding without occluding the vessel, withstand the forces of flowing blood, and slowly dissolve in concert with the wound healing process. Instabilities in any of these events can cause excessive clotting, or thrombosis, which is a leading cause of death. Despite the extensive knowledge base on the biochemistry and cell biology of clot formation, the mechanistic differences between a hemostatic clot and a thrombotic one remain largely unknown. Recent findings from the laboratory of the PI and from other labs suggest that impeding the transport of solutes away from the core of a clot is one mechanism that may prevent thrombosis. Based on this evidence, the hypothesis of the proposed studies is that transport of coagulation factors and platelet agonists within the interstitial space between blood cells is a key regulator of clot growth. If this hypothesis proves correct, then targeting this biophysical mechanism in conjunction with the conventional biochemical mechanisms could lead to more effective treatment of thrombosis.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>This proposal investigates an important physiological system through the development of quantitative relationships between clot composition and growth. The conventional models of clot formation focus primarily on the kinetic processes involved in coagulation reactions and platelet signaling. The proposed studies build upon previous models by incorporating interstitial solute transport as a key mechanism of clot growth. With more capable predictive methods available, better drugs and drug delivery strategies can be developed. This hypothesis will be addressed by the following specific aims: (i) identifying the transport barriers that regulate clot growth and arrest, (ii) mapping the pore structure of clots, and (iii) exploiting interstitial transport to modulate clot growth. The implemented approach relies on applying theories and methods from the field of porous media transport to characterizing transport in tissues. In vitro and in vivo models of vascular injury will be used to measure transport properties in clots and the structure of their interstitial pore space. Constitutive relationships describing solute transport as a function of clot structure and composition will be developed for a range of physiological conditions. Results will be used to assess how known risk factors for thrombosis lead to uncontrolled clot growth and how this process can be physically impeded.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The proposed studies will develop theoretical and experimental models to predict blood clot growth and test novel therapeutic strategies. This is a potentially transformative outcome since controlling thrombosis is one of the grand challenges in medicine. The research plan integrates with the education plan by creating K-12 outreach programs and undergraduate research opportunities focused on the interface between engineering and biology. Specific educational and outreach objectives include (i) improving middle school students' attitudes towards science with hands-on curriculum, (ii) developing and assessing inquiry-based learning program in bioengineering at a high school with predominantly Latino students, and (iii) establishing a summer undergraduate research program in cellular biomechanics in partnership with the Children's Hospital Colorado for students in the Multicultural Engineering Program at the Colorado School of Mines."

Unlike cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs), ciliary & flagellar doublet MTs are extremely stable and asymmetric, having complex periodic binding sites for associated dynein motors and components for regulation and signaling. This project focuses on doublet MTs, and specifically on a set of three protofilaments from A-tubules that can be isolated as long, hyper-stable ""ribbons"", composed of several proteins including tubulin and an integral filament of tektins. The location of tektin-ribbons in doublet MTs is unproven and controversial, and the solution could have profound implications. The most rapid, effective means to understanding the structure-function of tektin-ribbons is an integrated approach of biochemistry, state-of-the-art electron microscopy (EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) applied to sea urchin sperm flagella. The Objectives are: (1) To determine both the precise location of the ribbon in doublet MTs, and the position of the tektin filament within the ribbon. (2) To determine the high-resolution structure of the tektin filament. (3) To identify the tektin-binding domains in tubulin and tektin-bound inner dynein arms. The findings of this proposal will challenge current dogma and develop entirely new concepts for ciliary/flagellar motility and regulation. Based on the PI?s published research and preliminary studies, the PI?s hypothesis suggests the following original concepts: (i) That tektin-ribbons form a conserved core-skeleton of ciliary & flagellar axonemes. (ii) That tektins act as molecular rulers to determine the periodic binding sites of the effector molecules. (iii) That tektins interact with inner dynein arm motors, forming load-bearing cables that impact the mechanical and biophysical parameters crucial for ciliary & flagellar motility. (iv) That tektin filaments stabilize doublet MTs in their dynamic motions and during tubulin-turnover.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts of the Project<br/>This project provides excellent opportunities for the training of future educators, engineers, scientists and technicians. The PI has demonstrated success in recruiting and training under-graduate and high school students, as well as graduate students, including significant numbers of women and under-represented minorities. Future recruitment will come from the PI?s participation in the University of Minnesota Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, the Multicultural Summer Research Opportunities Program, and local community colleges (a principal gateway to professional training for many minorities). This activity will introduce undergraduates to scientific research. They will learn standard and advanced techniques of protein chemistry and electron microscopy (EM) from the PI and through workshops given by the University's Characterization Facility. The PI will mentor their training, including the development of critical thinking, interpretive skills, writing and speaking. Moreover, the project will foster interactions and interdisciplinary training with the collaborator, Dr. Daniela Nicastro, an expert in cryo-ET and a role model for female scientists. An especially valuable benefit of this training for undergraduates is this collaborative training provided in modern EM techniques and image processing, which provide skills beyond biology. Outside the specific field of cilia & flagella this study will have broad impacts in other areas of cell biology (e.g., cytokinesis, intermediate filaments, Hedgehog signaling), on evolutionary biology (ancestral relationship of tektin to intermediate filament protein, and speciation of insects and other phyla), and on nano-technology and nano-fabrication. In terms of the latter point, the PI is involved at several levels with engineers and material scientists to foster interdisciplinary training and intellectual exchange among students of biology and the physical sciences."

The law requires scientists in archaeology, anthropology and museums to consult with tribes to assess cultural affiliations, prepare documentation, and conduct repatriations. Scientists initially saw NAGPRA and subsequent repatriation and reburial of collections as deleterious to research goals, and some still do. Many continued their research as though nothing had changed, despite the federal mandate. This project targets a gap between indigenous and non-native stakeholders by looking at how repatriation ethics are learned, comparing how professionals at Western scientific institutions learn about NAGPRA with how professionals at indigenous institutions and tribal colleges gain this understanding. Tribal colleges are engaged as intellectual consultants in the project. We use ethnographic methods and communication studies to research ethics in this age of repatriation, and a collegium format to bring interdisciplinary multi-cultural stakeholders together to assess learning, address the potential of professional codes of ethics to aid practice, and evaluate the potential for curricula to move the repatriation-uncertain to the realm of repatriation partner. <br/><br/>Museums, universities, and cultural resource management companies all need personnel that understand how NAGPRA works and how it can inform and guide ethical and respectful research in archaeology and anthropology. Better understanding of indigenous perspectives on repatriation may help scientists to overcome barriers to developing scholarship with tribal partners. Resistance to NAGPRA and the consultation it requires has slowed the development of applied research that might assist indigenous groups in meeting tribal goals. NAGPRA compliance that acts as an entree to collaboration has the potential to transform biological anthropology and archaeology for the 21st century. Resources that have been tested and aggregated into an open-access setting can be used internationally as indigenous people across the globe increasingly seek control over not only ancestral remains and material culture, but also heritage and representation. In addition, the collegium structure may find use in other situations in which indigenous and westernized scientific knowledge are combined.

Recent sociological and historical research rejects the hypothesis that full assimilation is an unavoidable outcome of the ethnic experience. This literature stresses the fact that the United states remains a multicultural, pluralistic society and cites as evidence the social, cultural, and economic differences that exist and persist among ethnic groups. The purpose of this project is to develop a theoretical and empirical analysis of why and how these ethnic differences in skills and earnings persist across generations. The operational hypothesis of the study is that ethnicity acts as an externality in the human capital accumulation process. The simplest version of this hypothesis states that the skills of the next generation depend not only parental inputs, but also on the average quality of the ethnic environment in which these investments are made. The introduction of ethnic capital into an economic model of intergenerational mobility has an important, fundamental implication: ethnic differences and skills and earning observed in this generation are likely to persist for many generations and these difference may not be amenable to easy eradication. This hypothesis will be tested using a number of data sets, including the General Social Surveys, the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, and Public Use Samples of the U.S. Census."

The approach is to electromechanically rotate Halbach magnetic rotor?s over flat passive aluminum guideways. The simultaneous rotational and translational motion of the rotors induces guideway eddy currents that can provide suspension, thrust and lateral forces for the vehicle. Each rotor?s speed and direction will be controlled in order to achieve optimal efficiency and dynamic stability. Custom designed 3D finite element code will be utilized to model the high-speed rotational and translational motion. An experimental setup utilizing at least four Halbach rotors will be built. <br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>This research will involve the development of new electromagnetic optimizing techniques and control strategies for a fully 3D eddy-current electromechanical conversion device. Insightful trade-offs between stability requirements, efficiency, thrust and suspension levels will be considered. The research could lead to new methodologies for designing 3D eddy-current based machines. Novel multivariable control techniques will be employed in order to ensure stability of the complexly coupled device.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The utilization of a maglev transportation system could significantly reduce the nation?s dependence on petroleum-based energy thereby mitigating airborne pollutants. The project will contribute to the education and awareness of power engineering as an exciting area for research. Undergraduate and graduate students will assist with this project at all levels. The PI will work closely with faculty advisors and the Multicultural Office to ensure underrepresented students are involved. The research will be published in leading magnetics and control journals."

This project will address the issue of threatening or highly sensitive questions with the Grouped Answers Method (GAM). This method is designed to increase foreign-born respondents' willingness to participate in in-person interviews by offering absolute anonymity protection. It also is designed to eliminate (or minimize) measurement errors arising from perceived threat by the foreign-born respondent. The researchers will administer GAM in a field test with two of the six major language groups covering 98 percent of the American population. The method involves (1) showing each respondent a flash card with immigration statuses grouped in three boxes; (2) asking the respondent to pick the box that contains his or her current immigration status; and (3) never asking any respondent if he or she is undocumented. Slightly different flash cards are used with two non-overlapping equivalent samples of respondents, with each sample group shown a different card. The project will fulfill three research objectives: (1) appraise in cognitive pretests the usability and limitations of the GAM by investigating culturally sensitive aspects of a survey of the foreign-born, including recent arrivals, the early immigrants, and those with limited English proficiency; (2) design a survey questionnaire involving rigorous pretests with ethnic minorities; and (3) administer a field test with an optimal complex sampling design yet with limited generalizability, given a sample concentrated in a Chicago metropolitan area. The project will result in direct estimates of the foreign-born in all legal immigration statuses and an indirect estimate of the number of undocumented residents.<br/><br/>This project will develop and refine an innovative method of asking sensitive questions to foreign-born populations. Project activities will demonstrate the usability of the GAM with the foreign-born populations with different levels of linguistic and cross-cultural experience. The multi-cultural survey issues investigated in this project, including application of recent developments, will advance understanding of comparative survey methodologies and help develop best practice of crafting culturally sensitive questionnaires to be used for ethnic minorities. Graduate students will participate in research throughout the project, fostering creative integration of research and education. The project's pilot surveys in ethnic communities will promote efforts to learn about foreign-born residents and their participation in the American economy. GAM offers the possibility of providing reliable, valid data on immigration status in the foreign-born population, and project findings have the potential to produce substantial returns to government agencies, policymakers, researchers, and the general public within the U.S. and abroad."

Six students will be selected each year to participate in an intensive eight-week research program that involves collaboration by an international team of scientists from the United States, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. We pose behavioral and ecological hypotheses that use honey bees and solitary bees as model systems. The questions we address are basic in nature but have clear relevance to applied (agricultural) systems in the region where we work. Specifically, we address topics germane to invasive species in pollination systems, decision-making by foraging honey bees and learning patterns in honey bees as influenced by environmental factors. These investigations have direct application to crop pollination and the apicultural industry in Eurasia where honey bees and the solitary bees we study are native. Prior to departing for the field portion of the program, students will be immersed in a one-week course that focuses on experimental design and the history and nature of science; students also participate in the publication process and are supported in their development toward post-graduate studies. We intend to support a generation of scientists who understand the developing world and the relationship between the diversity of human culture and intellectual innovation. Students therefore participate in enrichment activities that include exposure to some of the most significant locations in human history that include archaeological sites along the Dardanelles (near Istanbul), the Aegean islands and throughout western Turkey. Since many large-scale ecological issues (including invasive species and associated pathogens) originate from outside the United States (a result of agricultural enterprise), the international and multicultural collaborations in the program represent a key ingredient in training our student participants to study biological systems in the modern world.

This organization was established in 1992 to promote and coordinate marine scientific research in order to advance knowledge of living marine resources, land-ocean and atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components and processes, resource usage, ocean response to global weather and climate change, and human impacts in the North Pacific. Members presently include Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the United States. Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual Meetings, scientific committee working groups and workshops, will also be funded through this award. <br/><br/>The availability of travel funds not only provides influence on the scientific planning for large scale international collaborations, but also provides the opportunity to entrain colleagues and graduate students into research collaborations, scientific sessions, and workshops. The scale of the North Pacific Ocean demands broad collaboration, and the intellectual merits of international collaboration leads to increased understanding of how diverse scientists address their research. Entrainment of young scientists from both the US and foreign countries into these collaborations represents one of the capacity building strategies of PICES, and one which has a broader impact on US science through appreciation of the diverse multicultural approaches to science. Funds have been add sufficient funds to this project to provide full travel support for young (<35 yr of age) academic scientists to the PICES annual meeting. With matching funds from PICES this will allow participation by 3 young academic scientists annually."

Principal attributes will be related to the probability of injury occurrence in mathematical models and the underlying hypothesis will be validated by comparing the predictions of these models with actual project outcomes. The teaching objectives are to incorporate new research knowledge into experiential learning modules with videos, augmented reality, and building information models and to implement an original pedagogical and andragogical instruction strategy that involves collaborative multicultural industry-student teams. <br/><br/>If successful, the research results will enhance understanding of the fundamental causes of construction injuries and allow for accurate risk forecasts, directly addressing a critical societal concern that affects approximately six percent of the US workforce. Robust and valid predictive models will facilitate the integration safety risk analysis into emerging visualization and simulation technologies. Such integration may drastically improve proactive hazard recognition, prioritization, and control of complex projects and allow safety to be objectively considered as a competing criterion during design and planning. Educational and outreach activities will involve the development of research-based software tools that will be shared with industry stakeholders and students at high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. The project places strong emphasis on outreach to the Hispanic community through recruitment of Hispanic research assistants and involvement of Hispanic industry leaders who will serve as student mentors and agents for research dissemination."

This RCN-SEES project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups by building a global network of women scholars from different ethnic and racial groups engaged in climate change research. Through international workshops and the Global Women Scholars peer to peer mentoring program, we will develop scholarly collaborations on population vulnerability, food security, and sustainability strategies. These research teams will act as both peer support for women scientists around the world and as a mentoring network to encourage more women and girls into the science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) disciplines. The effectiveness of these methods in educating and engaging women as climate change scientists at a global scale will be assessed enabling the project to make significant advances in our understanding of how to promote the inclusion of women in climate change and sustainability research. <br/><br/>We cannot solve global problems using half of the global capacity. Broadening the participation of women and members of underrepresented minorities is central to increasing U.S. competitiveness and addressing global climate change issues that have significant implications for our society. Mentoring, social networks, and peer support are important in any field but more critically needed to encourage women into the sciences. Women are under-represented in the STEM disciplines and research suggests that by providing social networks and peer support, we can increase the number of women participating as professionals in the science fields. This project focuses on creating a new generation of women scholars and promoting multidisciplinary and multi-cultural research that combines ecological, agricultural, social, and behavioral sciences related to women and sustainability."

It aims to capture, before the information is permanently lost, the linguistic features of each language, opening a window into the capabilities of the human mind, as well as the language's unique cultural, geographic, and social setting. The current project contributes to this goal by thoroughly documenting two neighboring related languages, Matngele and MalakMalak, spoken in remote northern Australia.<br/><br/>Lenore Grenoble and Dorothea Hoffman, experienced language documenters from the University of Chicago, will create an annotated database which will include indigenous historical and personal narratives, natural conversation, and data from targeted elicitation. They will create a rich corpus useful in investigating a range of grammatical features, especially spatial determiners, complex predicate ordering, and morphological marking of grammatical agents and patients. <br/><br/>Historical narratives from the indigenous languages of Australia are deeply rooted in landscape and environmental features. In these narratives, landscape features are inherent elements of the grammar and are expressed in substantial uses of deictic and spatial determiners, coverbs, and suffixes. The very structure of the narratives is determined by spatial ordering and the use of motion descriptions at episode boundaries. MalakMalak and Matngele narratives and other spontaneous speech samples are also excellent sources of data for optional ergative/absolutive case-marking syntactic structure that is governed by prosody, information structure, and discourse environment. Similarly, one finds information on complex predicates whose ordering is not fixed but also potentially determined by information structure. There are also a small number of optional noun classifiers whose usage is subject to discourse constraints. <br/><br/>Finally, the two tribes of MalakMalak and Matngele have been in close cultural and linguistic contact for a long time. Unique storytelling techniques and bilingualism in this setting offer exceptional insight into language and literary contact in a highly diverse multilingual and multicultural setting.<br/><br/>By involving, speakers, local schools, and adults no longer actively speaking the languages, the proposed project may be able to encourage revitalization processes of both languages. Documentary materials from this project will be accessible from the Endangered Languages Archive at the University of London and at the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures."

The idea is to create a micro-bubble using a laser next to the cell, and then use acoustic methods to obtain information about the mechanical properties of the cell. Such information would be used mainly for diagnostic purposes, but also for therapeutic purposes. This idea that a cell's mechanical properties can be used as a biomarker for pathogenic processes is currently being used to diagnose malaria, and there is some evidence that mechanical biomarkers may be used to diagnose cancer. The proposed work could lead directly from fluid dynamics research to applications. The proposed research will lead to more effective, cheaper, and faster cell-based on-chip diagnostic and therapeutic devices. As such, this research can have a major impact on public health world-wide.<br/><br/>Cellular mechanical properties have been found to be valuable indicators for pathogenesis and pathophysiology. This has led to the identification of a new class of biomarkers: mechanical biomarkers that offer some advantages over traditional biochemical biomarkers. While a number of mechanical biomarker-based microfluidic devices have already been proposed in the literature, the full potential of mechanical biomarkers in microfluidic-based diagnostics and therapeutics has yet to be revealed. One reason is the fact that no techniques are currently available for the quantitative assessment of cell deformability in relation to the forces acting on them. Current approaches for estimating the radiation forces on objects in streaming flows are based on classical solutions for idealized geometries (typically spheres) and small deformation of elastic inclusions in the flow. The proposed research will use computational techniques based on the immersed finite element method to advance knowledge in these areas. The goal is to relate cell deformability to the hydrodynamic forces imposed on a cell or on a group of cells in a microfluidic device. The validation of the proposed computational framework will be done against experiments with cancer cells in an opto-thermally-generated and acoustically-activated surface bubbles microfluidic device. The co-PIs propose to involve undergraduate students in research and to leverage already existing initiatives at Penn State in order to reach underrepresented minority students: the Women in Engineering Program and the Multicultural Engineering Program.<br/><br/>This award by the Fluid Dynamics Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) Program of the Division of Biological Infrastructure."

The research promises to create fundamental understanding of amorphous matrices, leading to effective new amorphous matrix systems for delivery of highly active, poorly bioavailable drugs. It will thus address a key impediment to productive drug development. The proposal has the following specific objectives: (1) Elucidate key requirements for polymeric stabilization of the amorphous form of model drugs in both the solid and solution phases by mechanistic studies. (2) Create screening methods to rapidly evaluate novel cellulose derivatives. (3) Synthesize two novel families of cellulose derivatives designed for drug miscibility, slow release, and pH-triggered release, as well as safety. (4) Design second generation cellulose derivatives based on screening results and solubility testing of key drugs with solubility and bioavailability issues. The team at Virginia Tech will synthesize novel long chain ester derivatives of carboxymethyl cellulose, and novel adipate esters of cellulose, varying the degree of substitution of carboxymethyl and other substituents to provide a range of hydrophobicity and release rates. The team at Purdue will carry out polarized light optical microscopy of spin coated polymer/model drug films that will provide mechanistic understanding and ultimately a screening method for new polymer delivery systems. They will screen solution stabilization by visible and UV spectroscopy of drug in polymer solution, using 1H NMR spectroscopy of the solutions to provide mechanistic understanding. Mechanistic understanding of how amorphous drugs are stabilized in the solid state, and especially in solution, by polymeric matrices, and creation of novel stabilization screening methods will provide valuable new tools of general use in the field. Furthermore, the research will generate biomaterials forming the basis of new drug delivery systems for rescue of failed pipeline drugs, enhancing efficacy of marketed drugs, and enabling conversions of injectable formulations to oral for enhanced compliance.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: Many important drugs, including several anticancer and antifungal agents, suffer from poor bioavailability due to the low aqueous solubility of their crystalline forms. One strategy for addressing this problem is to produce the drug in an amorphous modification, given the generally improved solubility of the amorphous material. This proposal develops a general approach to using cellulose derivatives to suppress drug crystallinity and enhance bioavailabilty. It will develop a systematic approach to understanding the mechanisms underlying this enhancement. The work could have very substantial impact inasmuch as effective delivery of many drugs represents a major impediment to their efficient implementation. The project provides an attractive multidisciplinary platform for the training of students, who will be associated not only with synthesis and characterization of materials but with developing drug formulations with practical utility. Minority undergraduate research participation will be encouraged at Purdue through the existing Pharmacy Multicultural Program, which provides 50% cost sharing for the student stipend. Past experience suggests that 3-5 students will be involved each year during the summers as well as the academic year."

In doing so, the Principal Investigators are extending the range of seismic imaging to depths below even the thickest continental crust into the mantle lithosphere, and at the same time maintaining good resolution to address first-order geologic problems. <br/><br/>They are verifying and validating two new techniques: 1) A novel approach to remove (deconvolve) complications arising from earthquake sources; and 2) through a process called ""migration"", to transform data into images of correct dimensions in distance and depth. The first method preserves all three components of seismic data -- a feat otherwise difficult to achieve. For migration, they are using the so-called Gaussian beams approach to image laterally varying, complex geologic structures. To investigate key targets of the continental lithosphere, they are starting with data from the Cascadia active continental margin. This high-quality dataset is in the public domain and has been the subject of several studies using other techniques, thus is a natural benchmark. <br/><br/>The primary focus of the research is to a recently recorded dataset from a very exciting seismic profile (""Hi-CLIMB"") across the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen -- the highest and the largest active continent-continent collision zone in the world. Chen just concluded three years of field work late last year; at elevations averaging 5,000 meters above sea-level. Over a distance of almost 800 km, the Hi-CLIMB array covers all major tectonic units of the Himalayas through central Tibet. Despite numerous obstacles, a dense station-spacing was achieved, as close as 3 km and never over 8 km, even over the high Himalayas. Furthermore, many stations are in the most remote part of Tibet where background noise is exceedingly low. The Hi-CLIMB dataset is not yet in the public domain and they expect to produce timely, exciting results regarding the deep-seated anatomy of the most majestic collision zone by matching an unprecedented dataset with new techniques. For comparative studies, two potential secondary targets are also identified. In each case, the large-scale geological setting is analogous to one of the primary targets and high-quality data from broadband arrays have been collected. <br/><br/>The researchers are making fundamental contributions to understanding how super-continents are assembled through continental collision. With a total of over 220 deployments, the Hi-CLIMB array is the most extensive broadband seismic experiment to date. In the near future, this dataset will only be eclipsed by the completion of the USArray of EarthScope. To this end, the work is timely in anticipation of other datasets to probe the continental lithosphere. In particular, the mobile component of the USArray has the potential of investigating a full spectrum of geologic settings over the North American continent.<br/><br/>With data now available from densely spaced, broadband seismic arrays, advances that were once strictly in the domain of exploration seismology can now be incorporated into seismic imaging techniques using earthquake sources. To this end, the techniques in this project are at the leading edge of research: Indeed, only earthquake sources can satisfy two stringent requirements simultaneously: 1) The source of illumination must be strong enough to penetrate the entire lithosphere; and 2) the cost and logistics must be affordable in an academic setting.<br/><br/>The project is expected to have broad societal impacts. One natural product is the improved images of the Himalayan seismic belt -- a leading seismogenic fault system of the world where millions of people reside, including a large fraction of population in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Better imaging of seismogenic structures in the central Himalayas provides essential constraints for seismic hazard analysis in a region where geologic disasters have global repercussions. Furthermore, efforts are being made to involve multi-cultural and minority students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as the inclusion of this work into undergraduate and graduate teaching, and public outreach programs. In terms of technical advances, the project incorporates aspects of seismic imaging originally developed by the petroleum industry for exploration of energy resources. As the work progresses, increased interactions and mutual feedback are expected between industrial and academic research."

In particular, previous anthropological and cultural psychological research illustrates two main styles of ways of thinking about one's self: independent (i.e., individualism) and interdependent (i.e., collectivism). Individuals from independent cultures, such as America, value their autonomy, uniqueness, freedom and right to self-expression, whereas individuals interdependent cultures, such as Japan, value social harmony, conformity and adherence to group norms. Cultural variation in self-construal style has previously been shown to broadly affect cognitive and emotional processes, especially those related to the self. Despite a large body of behavioral evidence demonstrating cultural influences on the self and a growing body of studies on the neurobiological mechanisms of self-relevant processes, very little is known about how culture affects self processes in the brain. The main objective of the proposed activity is to examine how culture affects mental and neural mechanisms underlying the self and social behavior. Using functional neuroimaging (fMRI) in a cross-cultural (e.g., Caucasian-Americans and native Japanese) and bicultural cohort of second-generation Japanese-American immigrants, the current research aims to characterize how different cultural styles of self construal affect self-relevant processes in the brain, particularly within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). One primary aim of the current research is to investigate how independent and interdependent selves differentially represent and process self-relevant information in the mind and brain. Another aim is to investigate neural mechanisms underlying the ability of multicultural individuals, possessing both independent and interdependent styles of self-construal, to ""switch"" between different self-construal styles depending on their sociocultural context. By incorporating cultural psychological theory into social and cognitive neuroscience research, this research project will lay a critical foundation for future research examining how diverse cultural environments influence the self and social behavior at multiple levels of analysis. At the broadest level, this project will integrate education and research by involving Japanese and American scientists at all levels who will gain training and experience in the development of novel cross-cultural neuroimaging techniques and effective international scientific collaboration. The expected findings may benefit society at large by demonstrating how different cultural styles of self-knowledge can lead to diverse, but effective, avenues to social functioning. This interdisciplinary research may have further implications for understanding the role of cultural factors in vulnerability to and prevalence of social and affective disorders involving the self."

To address the discontinuous nature of power generation from these renewable energy sources, an efficient and cost-effective means of energy storage device needs to be <br/>integrated with them. Regenerative fuel cells, particularly those capturing CO2 with H2O to produce formic acid, have been suggested. Thus, by combining the CO2 electrochemical reduction process with direct formic acid fuel cells, the prospects for future energy systems based on non-fossil energy sources are apparent. However, the reality is that the technology does not work so well and the promise goes unfulfilled. <br/><br/>PIs Su Ha and Louis Scudiero of Washington State University, and Sheng Dai of the University of Tennessee Knoxville ascribe the shortfall to the catalyst in the formic acid fuel cell. They point out that the existing anode electrocatalyst is Pd, and the cell performance is prevented from reaching its full potential by promotion of the undesired reaction pathways for formation of surface poisoning species. Improvement of the fuel cell catalyst could be had through bimetallic catalyst design. However progress is limited by the lack of understanding of how the various transition-metals used as supports influence the catalytic performance of supported Pd. It is proposed that improved catalyst selectivity will be had from catalysts made by coating transition-metals centers with a Pd shell in the core/shell structure. They intend to make these catalysts for test. <br/><br/>By treating the preparations to characterization of the surface electronic structure, chemical properties and catalytic performance for formic-acid oxidation, the current understanding will be improved upon. Based on the improved understanding of the bimetallic effect, one should be able to design superior bimetallic catalysts that increase the specific activity and inhibit further the undesired reaction pathways in formic acid oxidation. These superior bimetallic catalysts can be used to develop high efficiency regenerative DFAFC systems which make tractable the issue of intermittent power from renewable energy sources. <br/><br/>The success of the proposed research activities has the potential for broad societal impact because it leads to high performance and stable regenerative formic acid fuel cell systems. Such a system can capture CO2 and convert it into a fuel that is consumed in the fuel cell to produce electrical energy. <br/>The PIs have plans for disseminating this new knowledge to those outside the scientific community. At the Palouse Discovery Science Center, the PIs and graduate students will demonstrate the scientific principle of regenerative fuel cell technology to increase middle and high school students interest in pursuing science and engineering degrees. Furthermore, the PIs will disseminate the research findings to high school classrooms by continuously participating in the NSF funded Research Experiences for Teacher (RET) program at Washington State University. Undergraduate students will be given an opportunity to experience the latest fuel cell and renewable energy technologies using several in-class and out-of-class approaches, including building formic acid fuel cells for the national Chem-E-Car Competition. The PIs will actively involve the undergraduate students, especially females and underrepresented males at WSU and University of Tennessee into the proposed research activities. At WSU, this will be accomplished by working directly with the director of the Office of Multicultural Student Services."

In this project, researchers will investigate the role that cultural environment plays by examining both genetic expression and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. <br/><br/>The amygdala, a region of the brain associated with processing emotion, has been shown by recent imaging genomics research to vary as a function of type (short vs long allele) of serotonin transporter gene, called 5-HTTLPR. People who carry the short allele version of this functional polymorphism exhibit a greater amygdala response to emotional stimuli relative to people who carry the long allele version of the 5-HTTLPR. Additionally, the population frequency of short vs. long allele carriers of the 5-HTTLPR significantly varies between Caucasian and Japanese populations. However, little is known about how diverse cultural environments affect genetic expression in neural mechanisms underlying emotional behavior. <br/><br/>The current research investigates a view of the neurobiology of emotion as universal, by directly testing whether cultural environment affects 5-HTTLPR expression and amygdala response. The first main objective of the current research is to examine the effect of cultural environment on the expression of the 5-HTTLPR serotonin transporter gene on amygdala response to emotional stimuli by comparing genetic, neuroimaging and behavioral data from Native Japanese and Caucasian-American cohorts. A second objective of the current research is to determine how acculturation affects genetic expression of the 5-HTTLPR on amygdala response to emotional stimuli by including an additional Japanese-American cohort in the cross-cultural comparison. The present research aims to promote teaching, training and learning of universals and cultural variation across multiple levels of analysis. The present research may have further implications for assessing the significance of cultural factors on vulnerability to and prevalence of affective disorders, such as anxiety, in diverse cultural and multicultural populations."

Because the subsurface is shut off from oxygen in the atmosphere, these microbes need to find alternative compounds to ""breathe"" (reduction), in order to carry out the energetic cycles necessary to drive life. Sulfur and oxygen share many characteristics, including their ability to serve as ""breathable"" compounds. To better understand sulfur reduction, this project will incorporate different studies that will look at sulfur chemistry; protein biochemistry; and the genetics of sulfur-based ""breathing"" (respiration) in a hot, petroleum-rich subsurface environment. Together, these studies will help with understanding how these living systems are able to develop deep in the earth, how life might have evolved on the early oxygen-free earth, and even how life might evolve in other places in the universe. Undergraduate researchers will conduct the studies, with experienced undergraduates mentoring young researchers through successful programs designed for the retention of underrepresented and lower income students in science; therefore creating a stronger multicultural scientific teaching and research community. These studies will also be integrated into undergraduate courses in Microbial Ecology and Bioinformatics, in which data obtained in the Microbial Ecology laboratory experiments will be analyzed by the students in the Bioinformatics course.<br/><br/>Sulfur-based respiration is suggested to have been one of the earliest energy conserving pathways for life on earth. It remains important to the sulfur and elemental cycles in the atmosphere, oceans, sediments, and deep subsurface.

It is not at all clear which forms of sulfur contribute to the metabolism mechanisms of microbial sulfur respiration in situ, or how these enzymes mechanistically carry out this transformation. The relative levels of sulfur-reducing enzymes and microbes in many environments remain unknown. These overarching questions will be approached by focusing on a specific environment - a deep, hot, hydrocarbon-rich reservoir - and by integrating studies: (1) at the level of the microbial community by characterizing the microbes in the deep, hot subsurface environment and identifying sulfur-reducing microbes and enzymes through metagenomics and metatranscriptomics; (2) at the enzymatic level by determining the mechanisms of sulfur-reducing enzymes by kinetic and structural techniques; and (3) at the geochemical level by using cyclic voltammetry to determine the chemical speciation of sulfur in situ and during reduction by microbes and enzymes. A transformative aspect of this work is a way in which cyclic voltammetry will be used to obtain a ""snapshot"" of the entire range of sulfur species present during the reduction of sulfur by enzymes, isolated microbial species, and microbial populations. This work will also provide a view of the sulfur chemical species present in deep subsurface fluids in situ. Having a clear picture of sulfur metabolism in the deep subsurface will broaden our understanding of biogeochemical sulfur cycling, life in extreme environments, and evolutionary processes. It has been estimated that the subsurface environment contains 40-60% of the bacterial cells on earth, accounting for at least one third of the earth's carbon biomass. However, because of its hidden nature, this huge reservoir of biodiversity has only begun to be explored."

Modeled after the successful Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge Program (FVBP), the Arkansas program focuses on developing a strong academic foundation, research skills, and one-on-one mentoring relationships to foster the successful transition pathway from undergraduate to Masters-level and doctoral studies. The participating faculty and peer student mentors receive training and guidance from the FVBP team. In this program, Arkansas State University-Jonesboro (ASUJ) partners with University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) and Philander Smith College (PSC), both Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The project offers a testing ground to show whether the FVBP model, which worked between two urban, proximal institutions in Nashville, Tennessee can be successful, with suitable modifications, among rural, distal institutions with modest resources in Arkansas. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The program focuses on increasing the enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of URM, low-income, first-generation college students in interdisciplinary Masters-level programs in Environmental Sciences (EVS) and Molecular Biosciences (MBS) at ASUJ, and the Aquaculture and Fisheries (A&F) program at UAPB. Program activities include: (1) engaging faculty and students at partnering institutions in training workshops offered at ASUJ by a FVBP team, and diversity training by the Director of the Office of Diversity at ASUJ; (2) conducting an eight-week summer research program for URM junior and senior undergraduates at ASUJ and UAPB; (3) recruiting and supporting URM students in the EVS, MBS, and A&F Masters programs; and (4) recruiting and supporting URM students enrolled in the Masters programs to pursue Ph.D. programs at ASUJ and UAPB through financial, academic, and social mentoring support. These activities provide undergraduates with research experiences, build strong relationships between undergraduate peers and their faculty mentors, and inform students about the academic and financial aspects of graduate schools. Through these activities, the program aims to reduce barriers to URM participation at the graduate level of STEM education. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Over the five years of the project, twenty URM undergraduate students are being engaged in STEM research projects, eight students are being mentored to succeed in the Masters-level degree programs in EVS, MBS, and A&F at ASUJ and UAPB, and six of them are being fostered to pursue the respective Ph.D. programs. Students and faculty at partnering institutions are immersed in multicultural learning environments to increase URM participation in graduate-level STEM programs. This Arkansas bridge program can be a model for adaptation at other institutions nationwide. Progress and performance goals of the project are evaluated annually and used to refine the program. Results of the project are being disseminated through social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Blogosphere as well as in conferences including Arkansas EPSCoR Annual meetings."

This project examines how religious minorities represent themselves in an effort to gain acceptance by the larger secular society of which they are a part. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, asks how minority groups in democratic societies increasingly identify with, and invoke their religious identities toward their objectives for recognition and acceptance. Findings from this case study would be developed and shared with other researchers, building international scientific collaboration. Funding for this project will also broaden the participation of a historically underrepresented group in the sciences. <br/><br/>Randeep Hothi, under the supervision of Dr. Webb Keane of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor will explore how religious minority groups strategically represent themselves for the purposes of recognition. The researcher examines minority-operated media networks in order to examine how deliberations that occur at the scale of face-to-face interaction produce publicly circulating religious discourse. This project builds on recent research in linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics that pay close attention to language-use as a resource for positioning and orienting subjects in social life. The researcher looks at Sikh cultural production, a context that proves to be important for analyzing language-use and stance in sociolinguistics because of the processes of self-presentation are driven by recognition-based cultural politics. By examining how minority cultural producers make complicated decisions about how Sikhism should be publicly presented, which representations of Sikhism should be disseminated, and how they will address their audiences, this research will also explain how multicultural societies produce religious discourse. The 12-month field research project employs a range of conventional linguistic and ethnographic methods of data collection and analyses, including participant observation, interviews, breaching experiments, life history interviews, media and archival analysis, and discourse analysis. This research provides an opportunity to examine the wider ramifications of minority cultural production in secular societies, and how minority identities are articulated and socially situated in public address."

Molecular studies of species within several selected genera will be conducted to understand evolutionary relationships. Comparative analyses of the evolutionary relationships and biogeographical histories of the groups studied will allow for the testing of climate- and weather-based hypotheses of wind dispersal of spores to the Hawaiian Islands. Such comparisons will allow for an assessment of the possibility that long-distance wind dispersal to the archipelago has been essentially random across groups or if there are common patterns across groups due to the existence of common dispersal routes. The proposed research will make a significant contribution to our understanding of the historical biogeography of an evolutionarily and ecologically important and under-studied group of plants in the Hawaiian Islands and around the Pacific region. Because<br/>the ancestors of many native Hawaiian plants, fungi, and insects undoubtedly arrived via long-distance wind dispersal to the islands, this research will provide new insights into the origin and diversification of native groups of organisms in the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, hypotheses about evolutionary relationships will be generated for several groups of Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian ferns that will provide a basis for and lead to future, more detailed evolutionary studies. <br/>The proposed research will have a significant impact on the development of human resources by providing training and first-hand experience in evolutionary<br/>biology, systematics, biogeography, tropical biology, molecular techniques, and data analysis to graduate students at CU-Boulder and four or more undergraduate students per year at Carroll College and CU-Boulder. Several programs exist at the University of Colorado to encourage undergraduate students to become involved with research projects.

Funding for this project will thus create excellent training opportunities for students in interdisciplinary research. The PI takes an active role in multiple undergraduate and graduate programs at Virginia Tech (VT). Many of these programs emphasize interdisciplinary training; these include an NSF-IGERT program, the Interdepartmental Microbiology Graduate Program (IMGP), and Scieneering. Other programs aim to broaden and create opportunities for the underrepresented in science and the disadvantaged in society; they include the Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity, the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program, the VT Post Baccalaureate Research and Education Program, and various summer programs for undergraduates. A few of the programs receive funding from agencies including NSF while others are initiated by the faculty and supported by various institutions at VT. In addition, the outcome of this project may prove instrumental for more efficient energy transformation and utilization which present some of the most challenging environmental issues on a global scale."

Fortunately, organisms have devised a way to avoid autoimmunity, by 'testing' immature T cells (thymocytes) for self-reactivity as they mature in the protected environment of the thymus. If the T cell receptors expressed by an immature thymocyte engage self-antigens encountered in the thymus with high avidity, the TCRs will generate signals that kill the cell. A proportion of cells that pass this test mature into CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive T cells that populate the lymph nodes and spleen (the 'periphery'). Once in the periphery, T cells respond very differently to strong T cell receptor engagement. Instead of dying, they proliferate and differentiate into helper and killer lymphocytes. It is still a mystery how immature thymocytes and their immediate descendants, mature T cells, respond so differently to the identical TCR signal. Published findings funded by a previous NSF-RUI grant revealed a provocative distinction between the signaling cascades initiated by T cell receptors in immature and mature T cells. Whereas both cell populations respond to TCR stimulation by upregulating the expression of Nur77 - a transcription factor known to induce cell death - only mature T cells heavily phosphorylate Nur77, an event that banishes Nur77 to the cytosol of a cell. The investigators have also shown that the failure of immature T cells to phosphorylate Nur77 in response to TCR signals is in part due to their failure to activate (phosphorylate) a key upstream regulator of cell survival, Akt. The goal of the project is to move closer to the origin of the differences in TCR signaling between immature and mature T cells. The PI describes an unexpected finding, that immature T cells fail to phosphorylate Akt not because of a problem with the activity of upstream kinases, but because of an enhancement in the activity of an upstream phosphatase. The project will explore a novel hypothesis, that this phosphatase activity and holoenzyme composition differ between immature and mature T cells, and that these differences are the basis for the distinct response of immature and mature T cells to TCR stimulation. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The work will be performed entirely by undergraduates at Haverford College, and the experiments that led to the hypothesis were motivated directly by their original pursuits. The NSF RUI (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) funding not only allows students to be exposed to the most current research performed in the immunological discipline, but also permits them to be direct contributors to it. Funding of this project directly supports the efforts of senior Biology majors, all of whom are expected to perform an original research project. It will also support the development of younger students (many of whom are in Haverford's Multicultural Scholar Program) who join the lab in the summer or as work-study students during the academic year. All students are exposed to an educational approach that asks them to raise a question of importance, test a hypothesis experimentally, and rigorously critique data. NSF funds allow the students to engage in bench research at a sophisticated level and enhances the expectations that students and faculty have of each other as they collaborate in an effort that inspires the development a serious intellectual commitment, a willingness to engage literature, critique evidence, and the courage to speculate. Funds also permit students to follow their experimental 'noses' and wander off narrow trajectories to test an original thought. Some students produce publishable data and participate in writing papers, most will present their work at national and local scientific meetings, and some will discover something novel that will inspire the next grant and the next 'generation' of students. And those who may not pursue research as a career will still have experienced what it is like to be a participant rather than an observer in the generation of knowledge - and will leave with a more developed sense of responsibility for the quality of information that they will one day shape and share."

With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Robert Whallon will lead an international team of scholars in an investigation of this question at a large and important Neanderthal site in southeastern Europe.<br/><br/>There are currently great differences of opinion among Paleolithic archaeologists about whether the behavior and culture of our nearest biological relatives, the Neanderthals, was primitive and limited compared to us, or whether they show the beginnings of essentially modern behavior and culture. Recently, it has been proposed that the division of labor, universally characteristic of ethnographically known human hunter-gatherers, did not exist in Neanderthal societies, but was part of the socioeconomic systems of the modern human populations that spread from the eastern Mediterranean throughout Europe. It was presumably the greater effectiveness of an economic system based on the division of labor that allowed modern human populations to expand and replace the Neanderthals.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate this proposal by investigating the organization of Neanderthal subsistence economy and society over a long sequence of changing environmental conditions. Specifically, it will test the hypothesis that Neanderthals pursued large game hunting in warmer climates by bridging gaps between successful hunts by storing meat that was preserved by smoking and drying over fire. In colder climates, with little or no forest available for fuel, Neanderthals were unable to avoid unpredictable gaps in foraging success in this way, and were therefore subject to food stress and fluctuations in population. In these conditions, Neanderthal populations would have been comparatively small and sparse.<br/><br/>The location of this project is the site of Crvena Stijena, a large rock shelter on the western border of Montenegro. Crvena Stijena contains a sequence of undisturbed Middle Paleolithic archaeological deposits at least 9 m in depth, estimated to range in age from approximately 40,000 to 150,000 BP. This sequence probably represents the longest record of Neanderthal archaeology yet discovered in the southeastern Europe. Neanderthal economic and social organization in the occupations represented by these deposits will be reconstructed through coordinated studies of their hearths, the animal bones, the stone tools, and other remains, conducted by a series of expert specialists.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include significant components of teaching and training, especially of students in Balkan countries. American students are closely involved in this project as well, being trained in Paleolithic archaeology, and given opportunities for developing undergraduate honors theses and doctoral dissertation research. In the course of their participation, American students are also exposed to an international and multi-cultural experience that enhances their understanding of the world and of different cultures. In addition, the project will contribute significantly to the development of the research infrastructure in Montenegro, helping to build up comparative research and teaching collections in several research centers and museums."

Underrepresented minorities (URMs) currently form an extremely small percentage of students interested in ocean and other geosciences. The low numbers of URMs at upper-division levels are due in part to low retention of freshmen. Important contributing factors are the lack of success in introductory courses and lack of awareness of possible careers. Thus, in our Campus to the Coast program we address these problems directly and at an early stage in the college educational process. <br/>To meet these goals we focus on: 1) recruitment; 2) a pre-freshman experience [Ocean Sciences or Visit SML]; 3) a pre-sophomore experience [SML summer courses]; and 4) mentoring and networking by peers, near-peers, and faculty. The institutional partners in this proposal are the Shoals Marine Laboratory, Cornell University, and the University of New Hampshire. The program serves <br/>26-38 URM students per summer. <br/>The team closely collaborates with admissions and multicultural offices to alert high school students to opportunities in marine sciences by educating admissions staff about ocean sciences at UNH and Cornell, meet with URM students and families on campus hosting weekends, and provide Cornell and UNH admissions staff with information about our program. <br/>We offer two kinds of first-summer programs at SML. First there is an intensive three week program for ten students called Ocean Sciences that: (a) is inquiry-based and teaches critical thinking and collaborative learning within the context of ocean sciences; (b) excites and motivates students through direct interaction with marine environments and organisms; (c) involves careful assessment and a focus on improving individual learning skills; and (d) is taught in a small class setting, with extensive interaction with faculty and near-peer instructors. Second, for those students not able to take our Ocean Sciences course, we offer a short four-day program for ten students called Visit SML that introduces the opportunities and adventure of marine science. <br/>Six to eighteen students [for a total of 72 credit-hours per summer] take SML courses in areas of marine science of special interest to the individual student as part of the second summer program.

In computer-mediated organizations, teams of people from across the globe now work together on common problems, each bringing his or her own perspective and expertise. Despite the promise of new media for interaction across national and cultural boundaries, however, much of this potential fails to be realized. Multicultural teams are challenged by mismatches in social conventions, work styles, power relationships and conversational norms, which can lead to misunderstandings that negatively affect relationships among team members and the quality of group work. This project will lead to new tools and knowledge for communication across geographic and cultural boundaries that will be made widely available to the research community and general public.<br/><br/>Just as successful teams work together to ground the informational content of their messages, they need to likewise work together to build a shared understanding about the affective meaning of each other's behavior.

This project will contribute to the fields of computer-mediated communication and computer-supported cooperative work by developing new theories and understandings of how people use technology to communicate and collaborate across cultural boundaries. It will contribute to human-computer interaction, information science, and related fields through the development of new techniques and tools for improving a team's ability to regulate its interaction, thereby leading to better relationships among teammates and better outcomes. It will also contribute novel tools to evaluate coordination of affect in team interaction in real time and to provide interventions to improve team functioning.

Proteins destined for destruction are tagged with a chain composed of multiple copies of a small protein called ubiquitin. In this research project, the investigator will examine the relationship between how ubiquitin chains are connected and the ability of the proteasome to unfold the ubiquitin-modified protein targeted for degradation. The work will lead to a better understanding of why some proteins are degraded and others are spared, and have broad impact on the understanding of cellular processes. Many undergraduate and masters students will work on this project and thereby enhance their critical thinking and scientific inquiry skills, which will serve them well as they go on to careers in medicine, industry, academia or other fields. The investigator will work with Villanova's Center for Multicultural Affairs to increase the involvement of students from underrepresented groups in both this and other research experiences. He will also work to develop an inquiry-based lab class for students, which will help to expose students who do not do independent research to a research-type setting.<br/><br/>The 26S proteasome is responsible for the bulk of intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotes. While most substrates are degraded into small peptides, some ""slippery"" substrates are only partially degraded, with the released fragments taking on new cellular functions. The overall goal of research in the Kraut lab is to better understand the molecular basis of proteasomal processivity and its regulated failure, and to examine the relationship between the specific residues of ubiquitin attachment, unfolding ability and protein degradation. The hypothesis underlying this project is that polyubiquitin chains increase the unfolding ability of the proteasome, even after the chains have been removed from the substrate. Preliminary evidence suggests that chains linked through K48 of ubiquitin lead to more processive degradation with less release of partially degraded fragments than K63-linked chains, indicating that polyubiquitination does affect unfolding ability, and helping to explain why K63-linked chains normally don't lead to degradation in the cell. The project will focus on determining how ubiquitin chains communicate with the motor proteins that grip the substrate during unfolding and degradation by determining which components of the proteasome are required for enhanced processivity and how different types of ubiquitin chains affect the speed with which the proteasome unfolds and degrades its substrates or instead releases them. The investigator has established a processivity assay that measures the ability of the proteasome to unfold protein domains well after degradation is initiated, and enables analysis of the underlying kinetics of unfolding and degradation versus release. This assay, using multiple substrates and proteasome mutants, will be used to probe the mechanism by which K48-linked chains activate unfolding after a substrate is already undergoing the degradation process."

The recent discovery of axion electromagnetic coupling in topological insulators holds great promise for drastic improvement of performance in sensor technology. This new class of materials has a bulk insulating energy gap and gapless Dirac-cone surface states which are protected by time-reversal symmetry. Unlike in traditional semiconductors, back-scattering is prohibited because of unique spin transport on the surfaces, leading to exciting non-dissipative applications. The striking electromagnetic coupling and half-integer quantum Hall effects open up completely new and revolutionary applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics. This project proposes to exploit the axion electromagnetic coupling effect in topological insulators and to build ultra-sensitive magnetic sensors that surpass the performance of traditional magnetometers.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project includes (i) the demonstration of the intriguing electromagnetic coupling effect in topological insulators that has not yet been experimentally explored; (ii) the improved understanding of material properties including magnetic doping of surfaces, and the growth of heterostructures involving magnetic oxides in which the surface gap is opened to invoke the coupling effect; (iii) the exploration of a novel quantum capacitance approach for the detection of surface states at high temperatures; and (iv) the invention of topological sensors operating at ambient temperature with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution. The transformative concepts include the use of low-dissipation topologically protected surface-states of topological insulators for electronic and spintronic devices such as magnetic transducers, electrically tunable inductors, and quantum computation systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed project will lead to a new magnetometer technology that exploits bulk properties and surface states of topological insulators. The high sensitivity, high spatial resolution and low-dissipation performance can satisfy the demanding requirements in sensor technology. The successful project is expected to have potential applications in medical research such as brain wave detection and in military surveillance with an enhanced magnetic sensitivity at low fields. The development of this project can potentially improve the competitiveness of the EPSCoR state #8722 (Iowa State) in the area of magnetic sensor devices. Besides the technological impacts, the program has a strong and comprehensive education component. Students will gain invaluable research experience in this highly interdisciplinary area of electrical engineering, physics, and materials science, leading to enhanced training and ability to pursue innovations for the entirety of their careers. The PI will create a multicultural environment by recruiting students from underrepresented groups, particularly female students, through the existing outreach programs ""Science Bound"" and ""Program for Women in Science and Engineering"" at Iowa State University. Full tuitions, research assistances and resources will be supplied for their education. The students can have ample opportunities to learn state-of-the-art sensor technology and gain hand-on experience on topological insulators. Such experience will broaden their scientific horizons and thus become invaluable assets to their future careers. The outcomes of the program will be incorporated into a course on sensor technology and disseminated in conferences & through peer-reviewed publications. The PI will also actively participate in the K-12 program at Iowa State and continue to offer mini-lectures on nanotechnology and magnetism. Research frontiers of the topological electromagnetic sensors can be included as interesting demonstrations, aiming to stimulating students' curiosity, creativity, and enthusiasm in science and technology."

Despite recent progress in the field, a full understanding of the flow properties of entangled polymer solutions is lacking. A major challenge in polymer processing arises from the unusually complex flow dynamics of branched polymers, wherein molecular topology ultimately determines macroscopic material response. Traditionally, bulk rheological methods have been used to study polymer flows, but these methods average away individual molecular motions. To overcome these challenges, a new molecular approach to probe dynamics is required.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The proposed research aims to provide a molecular-level view of branched polymer dynamics in flow using single molecule methods. Polymer stress relaxation and the non-linear flow properties of entangled comb polymers will be studied, and single polymer data obtained from experiments will be compared to theoretical models. In this way, direct observation of backbone and branch relaxation at the molecular level will be pursued, facilitated by using dual-color fluorescent dyes on the backbone and side-chain branches. The proposed research relies on three innovative technologies developed in the PI's lab: (1) custom synthesis of linear and branched single stranded DNA (ssDNA) polymers with properties similar to synthetic chains, (2) dual-color labeling of branched ssDNA polymers at architecturally-specific locations such as backbones and branches, and (3) automated microfluidic-based flow systems that allow for controlled fluid flows, combined with single molecule imaging of polymer conformations with nanoscale resolution. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This research will provide a detailed molecular-level view of entangled topological networks, thereby establishing a direct link between the molecular properties of branched polymers and macroscopic flow properties (e.g., viscosity and stress). The proposed combined custom synthesis and molecular imaging approach will allow for the guided design of polymeric materials with tailored properties that give rise to a desired processing response. In this way, the proposed work will provide crucial insight into the improved processing and manufacturing of branched polymers. The proposed work also integrates cutting-edge research in molecular rheology with the educational training of graduate and undergraduate students, which is accomplished by mentoring students to work in a collaborative workspace. Educational outreach will be incorporated by working with the Illinois iRise program, which actively engages local K-12 high school science teachers in the Urbana-Champaign area to develop experimental labs for the classroom, and mentors middle and high school students from underrepresented groups, with a particular focus on sparking an interest in science through hands-on experiments.

Such supra-molecular assembly of macromolecules via specific intermolecular interactions requires a uniform chain length and a controlled sequence of H-bonding sites. Current living<br/>polymerization of vinyl monomers can produce polymers of controlled chain lengths, but cannot control the chain composition and sequence. The goal of this research, therefore, is to synthesize length- and sequence- specific self-assembling polymers and characterize their self-assembly properties. A novel templated-living radical polymerization (TLRP) using living radical polymerization to control the chain lengths and using a template to direct the monomer distribution and sequence will be used to synthesize such polymers. The template and its daughter chain have complementary H-bonding sites and thus are expected to self-assemble into 3D-structures such as highly aligned duplexes, reminiscent of DNA hybridization. Specific aims of the proposed research are to (1) design and synthesize self-assembling monomers and templates; (2) optimize living radical polymerization conditions for these monomers aimed at uniform chains and low polydispersity; (3) define conditions for the templated-living radical polymerization process; and (4) separate the template and its daughter chain and characterize their self-assembling properties. In preparation of this proposal, critical concepts have been demonstrated to confirm the feasibility of the proposed research. Living radical polymerization of sample monomers has been conducted. The preferable self-assembly of the monomers with the complementary polymer chains to the monomers, which is the prerequisite for the proposed TLRP, has also been demonstrated.<br/>Intellectual Merit: Synthesis of nan0-scale macromolecules capable of self-assembly into controlled supramolecular structures is a great challenge. This project will produce a templated-living radical polymerization for vinyl monomers to synthesize such self-assembling vinyl polymers. This study will lead to a fundamental understanding of the templated-polymerization and self-assembly of polymers, and provide guidance for our long-term goal of using peptide nucleic acid or oligonucleotides as templates.<br/>Broad Impact: The project includes strong societal and educational components. The proposed research will develop a new approach to synthesize new functional polymer <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>materials. These materials have many such potential applications as antisense medicines and biosensors, and new silk-like materials having exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. In conjunction with this research, the education goal of this project is to educate and train a new generation of skilled worker force and attract students to science and engineering. Thus, the education activities will involve students <br/>at all levels (college and precollege). The PI will include more students at all levels and particularly minority and women students involved in the research via (1) reaching out to<br/>precollege students, particularly underrepresented American Indians through the university's Multicultural Affairs Summer Research Apprentice Program, and (2) providing research opportunities to undergraduates via the summer scholarship program and the University's Research Experience Program. The PI will also integrate the results from this research, particularly the synthesis of bioinspired materials into his chemical engineering curricula. Particularly, the PI will create a Polymer Lab for his CHE 5190/4190 and CHE 5170/4170 offered to campus-wide graduate and undergraduate students to give the students hands-on experience in polymer synthesis, characterization and applications. Thus, this project will allow the PI to reach out and educate students at all levels, have them involved in the research, and align undergraduate education with research and graduate training programs.

The principal objective of this proposal is to develop a fundamental quantitative understanding of the coupled biogeochemical processes involved in the pyrite oxidation cycle and the carbon cycle, facilitating the evaluation and design of a sustainable remediation process. The proposed work is a follow-up to previously-funded bench-scale studies of the use of organic carbon additions for mitigation of AMD, which demonstrated that addition of organic carbon to acid generating rock stimulates the growth of heterotrophic microorganisms, consuming oxygen and sequestering ferric iron, thus inhibiting pyrite oxidation. The proposed research, which combines experiments and modeling across a range of scales, consists of the following major tasks: <br/>(1) Monitor reactions of AMD generation and inhibition under simulated environmental conditions for sufficient duration to determine mineral and organic carbon storage and transport from the interstitial pore to waste rock pile scale. <br/>(2) Develop expressions for microbial and chemical kinetics and diffusion rates in waste rock to use in computational models. <br/>(3) Characterize transport and storage of reactive organic and mineral constituents along flow paths in waste rock media over the range of spatial and temporal scales, to evaluate the sustainability of carbon addition for in-situ AMD remediation. <br/>(4) Incorporate the understanding gained from (1) - (3) into a rigorous reactive transport model and combine it with models of complex unsaturated flow in waste rock systems to predict the behavior at the waste-rock column and pile scale. <br/>(5) Carry out sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of carbon addition in inhibiting AMD formation in waste rock under a variety of environmental and hydrologic conditions. <br/><br/>The remediation strategy being explored in this project for in-situ control of AMD generation can potentially result in significant reduction in cost compared with current approaches. Moreover, the study of carbon addition to waste rock is an opportunity to identify the mechanisms that control carbon cycling in the subsurface after perturbation of an existing biogeochemical system. Once developed, the multi-scale model approach could be used to assess sustainability of other bioremediation methods such as constructed wetlands and bioreactive subsurface barriers. The multi-disciplinary nature of the research will provide unique opportunities for graduate student research and training in environmental engineering - with broad exposure to hydrology, geochemistry, microbiology and modeling. Large lab columns will provide educational and outreach opportunities targeted at undergraduate students, stakeholder groups and K-12 students in Colorado, where the environmental impacts of AMD are widespread. A diverse group of undergraduate student researchers will be recruited through the University of Colorado REU site in environmental engineering and the Summer Multicultural Access to Research and Training (SMART) program."

Todays System-in-Package (SiP) technology involves the system integration of multiple semiconductor dies from various technologies into a common package. This high-density system integration is made possible through interconnections between active devices, such as IC chips or between other discrete components, mounted on the package substrate. High resolution testing for todays SiP is becoming increasingly difficult due to the ultra fine geometry associated with the nano-scale wafer level packaging. The goal of this research is to explore a new and low-cost test technique for detecting interconnect defects in nano-scale SiP substrates. We propose to (1) develop the nano-scale interconnect modeling, (2) establish look-up table database, (3) fabricate an integrated MEMS probe that incorporates a MEMS resonator, and (4) implement embedded system integration for practical demonstration. The overall program ties research and education at all levels (K-12, undergraduate, graduate, continuing-education).

Medium to high-resolution structures can be predicted by the state-of-the-art methodologies through the combination of comparative modeling, threading and ab initio modeling techniques. The high-resolution models can be used for the analysis of biochemical function of the molecules in cells and for virtual ligand screening. The algorithms will be further improved by combining the I-TASSER structure assemble method with the meta-server threading techniques. As a complement to the full-length I-TASSER modeling, a locally installed meta-threading server (LOMETS) will be developed for the generation of multiple threading alignments and spatial restraints. The improvements will significantly increase the capacity of the service system to serve for the community, and help improve the quality of the core algorithms which the server systems are based on.

Examples include the weather and climate, the efficiency of combustion and chemical reactions, the convection of biological organisms in the oceans, heart dynamics, crystal growth from a melt, and fluid turbulence. A particular challenge is to understand spatiotemporal chaos, a commonly observed behavior of nonequilibrium systems where properties of the system evolve aperiodically in time and space. New fundamental insights into the spatiotemporal chaos of spatially-extended nonequilibrium systems will be obtained through a detailed numerical investigation of Rayleigh-Benard convection (a thin horizontal layer of fluid heated uniformly from below). The PI has developed parallel numerical methods providing accurate simulations for the precise conditions of experiment. This research builds upon these successes to explore spatiotemporal chaos in large-aspect-ratio convective domains to make predictions that can be verified by experiment. These predictions are only possible by the recent convergence of increased computing power and improved numerical algorithms, including the continuing research progress of the PI. The research will probe the origins and basic building blocks of spatiotemporal chaos to quantify the number, size, and dynamics of the individual chaotic degrees of freedom. Numerical simulations will also shed new insight upon transport in a chaotic flow field. As examples, an exploration of the enhancement of combustion efficiency in premixed gases by complex fluid velocity fields will directly affect energy production and consumption; and an understanding of the fluid convection driven by the activity of biological organisms suspended in oceans will improve models of the climate. The education program is tightly coupled with this research to provide extensive opportunities for students at all levels to participate in state-of-the-art engineering research. The PI's pre-college outreach program is focused upon exposing a large group of students, with special emphasis on under-represented groups, to challenges facing engineering today with the goal of attracting, retaining, and eventually graduating a more diverse group of world-class engineers. The PI is working closely with the Virginia Tech Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity to develop and implement programs that will reach over 400 pre-college students each year. The PI will develop, organize, and lead problem solving sessions that are guided by hands-on interactive numerical experiments. The numerical experiments will be directly related to this research and will spark the interests of young students with such subjects as the difficulty of weather prediction and the scientific meaning of the popular phrase ""the Butterfly Effect."" The interactive programs will be written in Java and publicly available on a computational science and engineering web site established for this purpose. The PI will mentor undergraduate students each academic year and each summer on projects related to this research. Students will be selected from the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program (MAOP) and a NSF funded Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). A new multidisciplinary graduate course will be developed entitled ""Spatiotemporal Chaos."" A major theme of the course will be the quantitative link between theory and experiment provided by the computations of this research. The education program will be carefully assessed and improved through a close collaboration with the Virginia Tech Engineering Education Department."

Undergraduate students enrolled in engineering and technology programs in traditional African-American institutions (HBCUs) such as AAMU face major challenges arising from the rapid change of technology in the work environment. Because of limited exposure to research activities these engineering and technology students are not up-to date with today's technologies, and this presents serious handicaps in their careers compared to their peers at other research-oriented universities. In addition, while the number of African-American students is increasing relatively in undergraduate engineering and technology programs, there are few students (1%) who pursue graduate- level study, and this is mainly because these students are never exposed to research activities during their studies. To address the above issues, AAMU established a research center ""Center for Transportation Infrastructure Safety and Security (TIS2)"" with a main objective of providing hands-on research experiences for undergraduate students. The TIS2 is a multidisciplinary research center that undertakes research dealing with safety and security of critical civil infrastructure and transportation systems for homeland security. With support from the NSF, US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Alabama Department of Transportation, an active research program was established to address critical research issues in the application of nanotechnology, microtechnology, and micro-optical technology in monitoring the health of civil infrastructure for safety and security. Therefore, the objective of the proposed REU site is to provide training activities through innovative research projects in health monitoring of civil infrastructure, especially for talented African-American students long deprived of research and hands-on engineering experience. Three students will be recruited from the host institution (AAMU), and seven students will be recruited from other institutions, mainly Tennessee State University, Jacksonville State University in Mississippi, Florida A&M University, Southern University in Louisiana, and Savanna State University in Georgia. The students will be recruited from relevant engineering programs (civil, electrical and mechanical engineering) and will be engaged in a ten-week multidisciplinary research program conducted at the TIS2 Center relating to health monitoring of critical civil infrastructure for safety and security and focusing on the use of nanotechnology-based devices such as NanoElectromechnical, MicroElectroMechanical, and MicroOpticalElectroMechanical Systems (NEMS, MEMS and MOEMS). <br/><br/>Each student will work on an individual project. Each project will be structured to challenge the student and to ensure the development of student-faculty interactions and student-student communication. In addition to providing research experience, the proposed program will seek to provide an integrated learning experience that will emphasize the formation of a strong sense of a multicultural community through social and cultural interactions. Additional enrichment and professional-development activities planned for the students include seminars and workshops. The students will be engaged in innovative and cutting-edge research projects related to monitoring of critical civil infrastructure health for safety and security. The students will take advantage of recent advancements in nanotechnology to develop a completely new class of devices for civil infrastructure. These novel sensors can be extremely cheap, wireless, and durable, and can greatly enhance the information available during the routine inspection of civil infrastructure. Due to their extremely low cost, the proposed nanotechnology-based sensors can be embedded or attached in the thousands and interrogated wirelessly with a minimum of time and effort. Such an approach enables better understanding of damage mechanisms in civil infrastructure and particularly of how certain key parameters affecting the durability of these structures progress. This information can be used to develop more efficient designs for future structures. This REU program enhances the technical and educational backgrounds of minority students by offering more collaborative research activities and improves the students' critical thinking, communication skills, research skills and ability to conduct unsupervised research work. The student participants are encouraged to publish the findings of their projects in journals, to present them at conferences, and to disseminate them at meetings to benefit the research community and industry."

Additionally, gene chips will be used to identify the genes responsible for antibiotic (aa-hydroxamate) tolerant phenotypes, and small network theory will be employed to understand how connectivity and clustering may affect antibiotic tolerance versus fitness. Improving the understanding of genome evolution and the tradeoffs between the yield from individual metabolic pathways and organism fitness is expected to make a positive impact on the metabolic engineering community. The impact follows from more insights being gleaned on how ""global"" versus ""local"" optimization is managed at the molecular level by cellular systems. Such insights, in turn, will allow for improved quantitative prediction of the outcome of different metabolic engineering strategies. Understanding better how genomic evolution can lead to antibiotic resistance and organism fitness should also positively impact work on contending with the medical problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The plan to integrate research into education and outreach has two objectives. First, outreach activities will be pursued via Women in Engineering, Multicultural Engineering, and high school honors programs. Secondly, undergraduates will be organized into teams that are charged with developing laboratory demonstration modules. Such teams will integrate prior coursework and learn collaboration skills while producing useful courseware."

The device is comprised of one or more optically transparent glass fibers (~40 microns in diameter) which are guided into a patient's tissue by a novel support ferrule. For dermatological applications, the device may be placed against a patient's skin, and mechanical compression causes the fiber needles to slide through the ferrule and painlessly penetrate the skin, similar to the dynamics of a mosquito bite. The fiber tips may be positioned at desirable target positions (potentially >2mm deep) within tissue. Some fibers may be hollow, enabling delivery of drugs (chemotherapeutic agents, nanomaterials etc.) to specific tissue regions for targeted treatment. Subsequent application of laser energy into the solid fibers will be transmitted efficiently to the target tissue containing the light-absorbing nanomaterials, thereby inducing selective photothermal or photochemical damage. To achieve clinical translation of this device for cancer treatment a fundamental understanding of its optical, mechanical, and therapeutic capability must be performed. To demonstrate the potential of this technology the research team has organized the research goals in the following three objectives:<br/><br/>1) Mechanical Penetration: Design and fabricate a fiberoptic microneedle device (FMD) and evaluate its performance in penetrating ex vivo porcine skin using white light photographic imaging and load-cell testing<br/>2) Optical/Fluid Delivery: Design and fabricate individual fiberoptic microneedles with solid cores to deliver light and hollow cores to deliver fluids containing nanoparticles, and evaluate their light/fluid delivery performance using brightfield and fluorescence imaging<br/>3) Thermal/Therapeutic: Evaluate photothermal damage specificity of FMD light delivery alone or in combination with nanoparticles using thermal imaging and cell viability assays<br/><br/>All objectives will involve experimentation using cell-based tissue representative phantoms and ex vivo porcine skin. Each objective has associated milestones to be completed during each of the three years of this project. Completion of this work will provide preliminary results necessary to move forward with animal and eventually human clinical trials for cancer treatment using the FMD. <br/><br/>The proposed research will greatly advance development of FMD-mediated laser cancer therapies by providing an understanding of the optical, mechanical, and therapeutic capabilities of this technology. Using the FMD, nanoparticles and light may be delivered to specific target sites several millimeters beneath an epithelial surface via minimally-invasive fiberoptic microneedles. Due to selective absorption of optical radiation by the nanoparticles in the target tissue, the optical dose can be more precisely delivered, reducing unwanted collateral tissue damage and associated pain, and promoting faster wound healing. This project involves interdisciplinary experimentation and modeling of tissue mechanics (needle penetration), tissue optics (light transport), transport of nanomaterials, heat generation and transport, and cellular injury. <br/><br/>Long-range societal impact of this work will be improved quality of life for cancer patients. The FMD is an enabling technology for minimally-invasive detection and treatment of early stage, small epithelial cancers located a few millimeters under the tissue surface, such as melanoma, uterine, and esophageal cancer. Early stage detection and treatment of cancer is the key to enhanced survival and diminished morbidity. The FMD device is appropriately scaled for minimally invasive selective detection and treatment of early stage tumors. Furthermore, the FMD is well suited to deliver photosensitizing drugs or nanomaterials to increase the selective tumor destruction while maintaining the viability of the surrounding healthy tissue. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide opportunities for students from different scientific fields to gain experience in experimental design, engineering, imaging, and computational modeling. The PI is devoted to increasing the number of females and minorities within the engineering field through active participation in programs such as Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program (MAOP), and Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity (CEED) at Virginia Tech. Funding from this proposal will allow recruitment of additional female and minority students to study in his biotransport and optics laboratory."

At the same time, these capabilities serve as the foundation for the design and development of novel applications of optical science. This Materials World Network project explores the science behind the interaction of light with exotic material structures having vanishingly small dielectric permittivity, also known as epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, that are potentially able to dramatically suppress diffraction of light and to extend the applicability of the quasi-static approximation to wavelength-scale systems. In this project, the researchers will create a novel material platform of ""designer"" ENZ media and will use this platform for building an analytical description of the optics of ENZ-related systems. Specifically, a set of experimental techniques will be developed for subwavelength lateral control of the permittivity profile of our materials, targeting important visible and IR frequency ranges. Optical characterization of these structures will be used to provide the foundation for novel numerical and analytical techniques capable of describing the light-matter interaction in complex ENZ-based media. It is expected that both the experimental and theoretical results of this work will have broader application for plasmonic- and meta- materials across the UV to THz wavelength ranges. The students involved in the project will benefit from the unique exposure to modern interdisciplinary projects combining materials science, chemistry, physics, and applied mathematics, and involving multiple institutions across the globe. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Optical science is increasingly interwoven with many aspects of our everyday life, from optical communications, to imaging, to a broad range of optical sensing technologies in health-, environmental, and security-related applications. New optical materials, with unique, yet designer-enabled, properties, promise to further improve the quality or our life, and perhaps as importantly, provide a better understanding of the fundamental interaction between two building blocks of our Universe, light and matter. In this Materials World Network project, an international team will develop a unique new class of materials, known as epsilon-near-zero materials, and analyze the interaction of these materials with light. This research has the potential to provide a novel material platform for merging optics and electronics technologies, bringing together the benefits of high-speed optical communications with the compactness of integrated circuits. The complementary expertise of the participants will provide a unique opportunity to expose participating students to modern interdisciplinary international collaboration, enhancing multi-discipline and multi-cultural exchange. The interaction between the research teams and the broader community will aim at increasing the participation of emerging scientists in STEM-related disciplines.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Electronic and Photonic Materials program and Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research."

Glasses are used as seals in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for generating electricity directly. It requires hermetic metal-ceramic seals functioning at 800C, which is challenging and susceptible to glass seal cracking during operation. To address this challenge, a novel concept of active self-repairable seals driven by surface energy will be pursued. The rationale behind this novel concept is that at the SOFC operating temperature of 800C a sealing glass with appropriate surface and thermophysical properties can heal or repair cracks created during thermal transients. However, a fundamental understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of crack healing in glasses and glass-ceramic composites is currently lacking. With such an understanding, one can identify the crack-healing/self-repair mechanism and be able to predict the healing time required for achieving self-repair in a functioning SOFC. In addition, the role of the crystalline ceramic phase created either by crystallization of the glass or added intentionally for influencing crack healing behavior will be better understood so that the glass-ceramic composites with optimum load-bearing capability and self-repairability can be designed for use as seals in a SOFC. Through this grant, the PI also will develop analytical models to describe and predict crack-healing and self-repair behaviors observed experimentally.<br/><br/>Seals play a critical role in several high-technology areas including SOFCs, vacuum technology, microelectronics, power electronics, and microelectromechanical systems. The proposed research will train graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral associates in invaluable technical and research skills applicable to both academia and industry and advance the resources of our institution by new facilities for the synthesis of glasses and glass-composites for high-technology applications. In addition, with the current emphasis on conserving our limited natural resources for energy production, efficient SOFCs will result in direct savings by lower fuel consumption for power generation and environmental impact. The minority/women undergraduate and high school students will be mentored and exposed to this research through Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP), and WEAT (Women In Engineering, Architecture & Technology) programs. A significant outreach to high schools is proposed through ASM materials workshops and camps for teachers and students."

Approximately 80% of membrane proteins with known structures exist as oligomers when crystallized, indicating a large portion of proteins function as oligomers in cell membranes. However, questions remain about how proteins oligomerize in the cell membrane and how oligomerization determines protein functions. A thorough understanding of these questions will have an immense impact on many research areas including the biogenesis of cell membranes, establishment of homeostasis, signal transduction, material transport across cell membranes and regulation of protein functions in membranes. As a step toward a fundamental understanding of the preference for oligomer fomation, this project is designed to test the hypothesis that oligomer stabilities of membrane proteins are optimized to support function and a significant increase of stability will decrease activity. Escherichia coli protein AcrB will be used as a model. The hypothesis will be tested through creation and characterization of AcrB mutants with decreased or increased oligomer stability. An array of biochemical and biophysical methods will be used, including site-directed and random mutagenesis, protein extraction and purification, a protein activity assay, disulfide trapping, gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. Outcomes from this research will reveal the influence of quaternary structure stability on AcrB function. This study is expected to generate some of the first data pertaining to the correlation between oligomer stability of multi-domain and multi-span helical membrane proteins and their in vivo activity. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This work will involve a wide range of student training from high school to graduate candidates pursing Ph.D. degrees. Two graduate students will be trained to tackle scientific questions in the research area of membrane protein structure, function, folding, and interaction. In addition, two to three undergraduate and high school students will participate in the proposed research, through which they will gain hands-on experience in undertaking research in modern biochemistry. Special focus will be given to the recruitment and education of underrepresented and minority undergraduate students. The PI will provide an opportunity for students to work in a multidisciplinary and multicultural environment, preparing them for the increasingly international and global working environment. The discoveries resulting from the proposed research will be disseminated to scientific communities at large, through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at research conferences."

Over 60 percent of its more than 17,000 students are underrepresented minorities and an estimated two-thirds are the first in their families to attend college. Approximately 85 percent of UTEP's students come from El Paso County, a fast growing urban region representative of many large southwestern cities that now have, or soon will have, a majority of their population composed of groups currently underrepresented in the science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) workforce. UTEP, however, is unique in that it is the only major urban university in the Southwest whose ethnic distribution matches the demographics of the region it serves. The Model Institutions for Excellence (MIE) program provides UTEP the opportunity to serve as a model for the urban university of the future, one with a mission to serve a multicultural population where minority students comprise the majority. UTEP's MIE project will address the major impediment to increasing the number of bachelor's degrees in SEM disciplines: the unacceptably high attrition of entering SEM students. UTEP proposes a dynamic approach to meeting the needs of entering students, needs that will change as local school improvement programs, such as the NSF-funded El Paso Systemic Initiative, improve area students' preparation in mathematics and science. UTEP's MIE plan will help first-year students understand how to succeed in college, reduce class size in first-year courses, and present a broad picture of what SEM disciplines are about and the opportunities that careers in these fields provide. Most importantly, through MIE, UTEP's faculty commit to the concept that they are responsible for more than classroom instruction, that they are also responsible for the development of the entire student and the creation of an on-campus environment that supports learning and personal development. Since many of these activities will utilize undergraduates a s mentors and peer instructors, an additional benefit will be the provision of meaningful work experiences for a student body composed of people with financial responsibilities they must meet while attending school. UTEP will also use MIE to accelerate the introduction of active learning strategies into all of its SEM courses. Such strategies include cooperative learning, computer-assisted instruction, the linking of English composition courses with SEM courses, and peer instruction. To make active learning and effective teaching a reality, MIE will serve as a catalyst for a change in thinking about the mission and responsibilities of faculty by working to modify the major determinants of faculty rewards from research to the promotion of learning. MIE will provide resources to enrich the quality and increase the quantity of SEM programs through addition of faculty and staff and the upgrading of infrastructure in the degree programs likely to yield the greatest increase in SEM graduates. A goal of MIE will be to ensure that every SEM student participates at least once in a professional enrichment experience by serving as a research assistant in an on-campus research project or as an intern or co-op student in government of industry. Finally, MIE will impact the university educational infrastructure by providing resources to improve UTEP's ability to advise students, track their progress, and evaluate the effectiveness of programs. UTEP will manage MIE through a unique combination of expertise in academic and student affairs. The Principal Investigator is a national leader in engineering education with experience managing large interdisciplinary programs. The Co-PI brings similar experience in the student affairs area. They will work with an advisory committee of key faculty, administrators, and regional SEM leaders from industry and government to change the very nature of SEM education at UTEP. 2 University of Texas at El Paso"

The work is motivated by recent findings that North Atlantic Ocean salinity changes during the last glacial cycle show that abrupt climate change events are associated with significant changes in the low-latitude hydrologic cycle, suggesting that tropical atmospheric circulation plays an important role in climate change. <br/> Research will involve documenting past sea surface temperature and salinity as well as large-scale ocean circulation changes by using unique temperature and salinity proxies in foraminifera tests from sediment cores from the Florida Straits. Proxies include Mg/Ca-paleothermometry, oxygen isotope analyses, and Ba/Ca ratios in planktonic (floating) foraminifera tests. Companion data from benthic (seafloor dwelling) foraminiferal records from the same cores will identify the timing of Florida Current transport changes across major climate transitions. Because the relative timing between signals will be established in a single core, research goals will be to identify the influence on the subtropical/tropical Atlantic hydrologic cycle on the hydrologic cycle and to examine of abrupt climate events during the last glacial period were driven by atmospheric circulation change that then impacted AMOC. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The recent rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and their potential to strengthen the hydrologic cycle gives urgent need to better understanding the role of freshwater fluxes in ocean-atmosphere interactions. This research will help us understand past changes in the tropical hydrologic cycle during abrupt climate events. Furthermore, the companion high-resolution records of intermediate-water density changes have the potential to determine the rate and timing of large-scale ocean circulation change across the largest climate transitions of the last 40,000 years and can be used in climate modeles to predict how recent changes in the hydrologic cycle will alter global climate in the near future. Data will be archived at the World Data Center for Paleoclimatology at NOAA in Boulder, Colorado. Results will be incorporated into graduate classes at Texas A&M. The work will support a graduate student and include the training of undergraduates.

The main hypothesis behind the proposed research is that the process of transcription could be effectively controlled via a disruption of key transcription factor-coactivator interactions. Prof. Olenyuk's integrated research and education program focuses on design, synthesis and study of biological properties of the new class of small molecules which serve as potent and specific inhibitors of a contact between cysteine-histidine rich domains of the coactivator proteins and transactivation domains of transcription factors. The mechanistic details of such transcriptional inhibition will be explored at the molecular level by using tools and methods of chemical genetics. The proposed projects will yield broader impacts by creating a foundation for development of the unique genomic tools for such emerging fields as genetic medicine, nanomedicine and tissue engineering. The broad, multidisciplinary research platform will foster the development of necessary research skills and scientific knowledge for students at all levels at the fast evolving interface of chemistry and biomedical fields.<br/><br/>Professor Olenyuk will establish an innovative approach to introduce topics in chemical biology to students from diverse backgrounds in the Tucson Public School System.

While genetically identical for much of the genome, the population has members that have specialized and adapted to live at different temperature zones along creek. This study takes an innovative approach using genomic data to identify strong candidates for genes responsible for natural variation within the population and that are temperature associated. Genes thus identified can shed light on the type, function, and number of genes involved in thermal adaptation. <br/><br/>Fundamental questions regarding how ecological niches develop in populations are: 1) what kind of genes are involved, regulatory or protein encoding? 2) What do the genes encode? and 3) How many genes are involved? This study's unique focus on a natural population facing a well defined environmental gradient, allows a robust analysis of associations between genetic makeup and the environmental variable.

Although there has been a substantial amount of research on computer-mediated communication, very little has been said on the issue of cultural differences in assessing the uses and interpretations of current technologies. The very ubiquity of social computing applications makes the study of cultural differences in their use for relational maintenance difficult. Focusing on environments where social relationships are paramount for survival and where computer-mediated communication applications are relatively limited in number can help us examine how cultural preferences, social needs and constraints of available infrastructure shape the use of computer-mediated communication for relational maintenance. The goal of this research is to make empirical and theoretical contributions to ongoing research on cultural differences in the use of computer-mediated communication through the investigations of the role of social media in transnational contexts. This research will also contribute to the development of theory of the basic processes underlying social relationships through empirical investigations of non-western relational maintenance practices.<br/><br/>The results of this research will address how cultural differences can shape future development and design of human-centered computing applications and will enhance ongoing efforts to promote design and deployment of computer-mediated communication technologies in digitally nascent societies. By turning attention to the cultural contexts of technology use for relational maintenance, we also seek to engage with people whose perspectives are often unheard, including transnational migrants. Contextual study of Internet and social network site use is especially valuable in a culture that differs from the predominantly Western perspective that developed or provided templates for the development of the majority of current social computing applications."

The project includes a demonstration research project to study the Mills model of teacher education and the factors within it that support their teacher graduates' very high retention rates in urban high-needs schools. Over the course of the project, scholarships are being offered to 12 female undergraduate senior STEM majors and to 36 male and female graduate students in the MCMS program, each with an undergraduate major in STEM. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: A key component of Open the Gate is engaging the scholarship students in the construction of a demonstration research project to study this teacher education model in order to determine how the skills and knowledge of STEM pre-service students develop over time, the experiences that lead to their progress in the pre- and in-service years, and their relationship to the graduates' longevity as teachers in high poverty schools. Thus, graduates from this project are advancing the scholarship of teaching within the fields of mathematics and science education through their skills as teacher-researchers who ask scholarly questions arising from complex curricular and pedagogical problems that require sustained, careful and systematic examination of their practice in an effort to improve it. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Half of the credential students graduating from Mills come from racial, ethnic, and linguistic groups underrepresented in math and science. Increasing these percentages by recruiting and supporting students of color and first generation college students is an active goal of this project. Located at a women's college, Open the Gate is also well positioned to increase gender diversity in the pool of future math and science teachers. Information learned will be disseminated at state, national and international conferences and professional meetings with math and science, multicultural, and teacher educators.

Human power-assisting systems, e.g., powered lifting devices that aid human operators in manipulating heavy or bulky loads, require physical contact between the operator and machine, creating a coupled dynamic system. This coupled dynamic has been shown to introduce inherent instabilities and performance degradation due to a change in human stiffness; when instability is encountered, a human operator often attempts to control the oscillation by stiffening their arm, which leads to a stiffer system with more instability. The project will establish control algorithms for robot co-workers that proactively adjust the contact impedance between the operator and robotic manipulator for achieving higher performance and stability. This research will 1) understand the association between neuromuscular adaptations and system performance limits, 2) develop probabilistic methods to classify and predict the transition of operator's cognitive and physical states from physiological measures, and 3) integrate this knowledge into a structure of shared human-robot and demonstrate the efficacy in a powered lifting device with real-world constraints at vehicle assembly facilities. <br/><br/>If successful, the research will benefit the communities interested in the adaptive shared control approach for advanced manufacturing and process design, including automobile, aerospace, and military.

The research hypothesizes that (1) variability in muscle forces and signal-dependency can be characterized by quantized actuation profiles in non-uniform modular actuator system, (2) a quantized actuator recruitment approach reproduces such signal-dependent variability without introducing an artificial source of noise into robotic architecture, and (3) optimization principles in muscle coordination can be modeled mathematically by mapping the variability at the level of individual muscles to the variability at an end-point from a stochastic control perspective.

The past communities will be reconstructed using shellfish remains found abundantly at or around the surface in coastal habitats. Also, the project will assess fossilization potential (probability of preservation) of major types of marine animals, with primary focus on shellfish. Using coastal habitats of the Outer Banks (North Carolina, USA), marine communities will be assessed quantitatively in terms of several major groups of animals important both in commercial and scientific terms. The targeted field area has been selected because of the presence of abundant and diverse marine animals (both live and dead), including benthic mollusks, echinoids, arthropods, annelids, and brachiopods. We will sample multiple sites to carry out quantitative comparisons of living organisms and dead shellfish remains. The project should generate a dataset of ~20,000 specimens representing ~200 samples of living and/or dead organisms.<br/>Two primary goals motivate this study. First goal is to quantify differences between live communities and dead shellfish accumulations in order to provide data that will allow us to interpret more reliably ecological information preserved in the fossil record (shellfish is a dominant type of organisms preserved as fossils). Namely, to develop more rigorous understanding of environmental and ecological changes recorded in the fossil record, it is necessary to determine whether death assemblages can provide meaningful estimates of biodiversity, faunal composition, and other aspects of living communities. Second, a rigorous understanding of long-term ecosystem changes in areas inhabited by present-day shellfish communities is critical for assessing human impacts on marine life. Namely, systematic sampling of extant, ecologically understood, and often economically important shellfish should contribute direct data for assessing human impacts on coastal ecosystems. This, in turn, should result in a more informed evaluation of environmental -- and, ultimately, societal -- consequences of our diverse activities in coastal areas (from industry to tourism) and improved guidelines for developing sustainable approaches to human uses of coastal areas.<br/>This project will offer a venue for training a post-doctoral researcher in integrating disparate data and developing transferable skills in paleontology, marine sciences, and statistical methods. In addition funding has been allocated for undergraduate student internships to be recruited from underrepresented minority groups (with assistance from the on-campus Department of Multicultural Programs and Services). These undergraduates will receive hands-on field experience and will be involved in science educational/outreach activities, which will also allow them to develop competitive portfolios for pursuing graduate education. Numerous undergraduate educational and research opportunities will also be provided by this project, including datasets suitable for developing laboratory exercise in introductory and advanced courses in natural sciences. This proposal will support one female post-doctoral researcher and initiate collaboration between Virginia Tech and Duke University Marine Laboratory.

This approach will be applied to the depositional system (sedimentary basin) of the Po Plain Delta, Italy. The goals include (1) assessments of stratigraphic biases that may affect quantitative data based on fossils; (2) numerical calibrations of the regional sequence stratigraphic model; and (3) reconstructions of eco-environmental changes during high-frequency sea-level fluctuations that shaped the recent geological history of this culturally and economically important region. To achieve those goals, Quaternary marine successions of the Po Plain, which contain abundant fossil mollusks, will be sampled to quantify commonly studied paleontological patterns (e.g., diversity, body size, etc.). The resulting data, based on numerous samples from multiple cores, will be integrated with the regional sequence-stratigraphic model, bathymetric surveys of present-day Mediterranean mollusk populations, and high-resolution geochronology (radiocarbon-calibrated amino-acid racemization dating). The intellectual novelty of the project resides in data-intense integration of paleoecology, sequence stratigraphy, and geochronology, which should produce a time-controlled 3D reconstruction of eco-environmental and depositional histories of the Po Plain basin. In terms of broader impacts, research efforts will be interfaced with educational and outreach activities at multiple levels. At the graduate level, a Ph.D. student will be trained in integrating disparate data and developing transferable skills in geological and statistical methods. At the undergraduate and K-12 levels, a new interactive educational exhibit (evolved from research activities) will be developed at the Virginia Tech Museum of Geosciences, an outreach/education outlet of rural Appalachia. The exhibit will make the process of multifaceted quantitative research and discovery accessible to K-12 students, science teachers, and the general public. The exhibit-based lab exercises for undergraduate college courses in paleontology and historical geology will also be developed. In addition, with assistance from the on-campus Department of Multicultural Programs and Services, undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be recruited as paid interns in order to participate in the exhibit development and to establish competitive professional portfolios. Finally, the project will involve long-term international interactions between Virginia Tech and University of Bologna.

An ill-verified design compromises not only reliability, but also security of the hardware. Therefore, having a sound and effective verification framework plays a critical role in designing today's large scale circuits. However, the exponential growth in circuit complexity over the past few decades has made verification and validation an extremely daunting task. Hence, in many projects the level of effort needed to verify the correctness of systems often far exceeds efforts spent on design. Thus, much-needed verification and validation breakthroughs hold the key to ease this mounting challenge. <br/><br/>The objectives of this project is to address this need via four coherent tasks: multiple abstractions for extracting various core functional behaviors and diversifying search perspectives; swarm-aggregate learning of branching behavior and necessary loop repetitions; combined particle swarm optimization with ACO in generating long sequences; and GPGPUs for enhancing performance and scalability. Together, these tasks elicit the collective power of diverse perspectives, thus aiming to advance the knowledge of verification. The proposed approach is flexible and is not restricted by the inherent depth limitation imposed by deterministic methods. Furthermore, with swarm-aggregate learning applied to GPGPUs, the computational cost can be significantly reduced. It is expected that the synergy from simulation, swarm intelligence, multiple concurrent abstractions, and GPGPUs will bring out the best from each domain to achieve a common goal.<br/><br/>Making significant strides in the field of verification and validation will not only reduce time to market products, but also will increase national competitiveness both from the technical and economic standpoint using design optimizations previously deemed unattainable. Through the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program (MAOP) at Virginia Tech the PI will advise a diverse team of graduate students, including both women and minority students under-represented in engineering. The project also plans continued expansion of downloadable resources (tools, benchmarks, etc.), benefiting both industry and academia."

The proposed system is an ionic complex of chitosan, a positively charged polyelectrolyte, and cellulose nanocrystals, negatively charged, cylindrical macroions. Chitosan will impart to the system bioadhesive and bioabsorption-enhancing properties, whereas the cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) will bind poorly soluble therapeutic molecules via surface complexation, thus preventing undesirable crystallization, and control their release rate through desorption. The long-term goal of the proposed research is a multifunctional oral delivery system for therapeutic agents that provides zero-order (constant rate) release while simultaneously enhancing the agent?s solubility and absorption and, thus, bioavailability. The specific objectives are: (1) Develop a detailed understanding of the factors governing the formation and properties of chitosan?CNC complexes, (2) Characterize the molecular interactions of selected model drugs with a cellulose surface, (3) Assess the drug loading and release efficiencies of chitosan?CNC complexes, (4) Assess the safety of ingestion of CNCs and chitosan?CNC complexes in vitro, (5) Assess the mucoadhesive properties of chitosan?CNC complexes in vitro, and (6) Assess the permeability-enhancing properties of chitosan?CNC complexes in vitro. The project will employ physicochemical and microscopy methods to study the formation and properties of the ionic complex and its interactions with and release of model drugs. Cell culture studies will be used to assess the toxicity of the ionic complex to human intestinal epithelial cells and the complexes effectiveness to enhance drug permeability.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The proposal is inherently interdisciplinary, pairing a polymer chemist and molecular biologist. It thus benefits from the intrinsic information exchange arising from such collaborations. The proposed drug delivery system is highly versatile by reason of its oral safety, biocompatibility, and environmental biodegradability. As a result, the system could also be used for controlled release of functional molecules in foodstuffs, cosmetics, agricultural applications, and applications in the emerging field of functional textiles, to name a few. In addition to the technological impact, three graduate students will be trained in the interdisciplinary environment of the project and up to six undergraduate students will be trained on the project by providing them with summer undergraduate research experience. Undergraduate student participants, and intramural funding to supplement the NSF funding committed to support undergraduates, will be sought through the Virginia Tech Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program and an existing Virginia Tech REU program."

The instrument is expected to catalyze new approaches for conducting research via synergistic amalgamation of heterogeneous supercomputing and cyber-enabled tools that enhance ease of use. In particular, it should allow end users to:<br/>- Make commonplace the ability to perform in-situ visualization for rapid visual information synthesis and analysis, and<br/>- Control their level of immersion in the discovery process from being immersed (a la 'human in the loop' intuitively making real-time decisions via a large-scale gigapixel display), to observing the instrument automatically collect, organize, and analyze data of visual analytics.<br/>Recent trends have exposed the CPU as a 'jack of all computing trades, master of none,' thus giving rise to heterogeneous computing instruments with multiple types of brains (e.g., CPUs and GPUs). Though conventional wisdom believed in 2007 that missing genes in 699 microbial genomes was computationally infeasible, the PI led a team of more than twenty interdisciplinary researchers from eight institutions around the world and developed software cybertool instruments to integrate a set of distributed supercomputing with more that twelve thousand CPUs to complete the task in ten weeks. Coupled with the existing cybertools and those available from NVIDIA the instrument should enable completion of the task in a day with only two researchers. HokieSpeed will have 8,192 CPU cores and at least 61,440 GPU cores in 40 square feet and deliver 35 times better peak performance, 70 times better power efficiency, and 14 times better space efficiency than the current system at the institution (circa 2003) while offering versatility by enabling discovery through a large-scale gigapixel display and appropriately varying degrees of interaction between human and machine. Creating new forms of social research, and 'what if' scenarios for evaluation and promising to deliver research advances across multiple disciplines, the results will be generated often in real time allowing immediate in-situ visualization on a gigapixel display.<br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Reaching a broad community, the instrument is expected to herald a new age in multi-purpose and interdisciplinary computing instrumentation creating a computational ecosystem that simplifies access and use of the instrument to the masses. Students, including females and underrepresented minorities, will learn about energy-efficient computing, and visualization and interaction at large scale. Among others, the project will also utilize programs that specifically service broader impacts: MAOP (Multicultural/Minority Academic Opportunities Program), CTech2 (Computers and Technology at VaTech), and CRA-W's CREU (Collaborative Research Experience for Undergraduates). Additionally, it will extend an experimental GPU course and offer a workshop version for on-line instruction. Other activities include K-12 outreach, and delivery by CREU of information technology (IT) to rural and economically disadvantaged areas via virtual computing and the VaTech-STEM K-12 Outreach Initiative."

This research in the laboratories of Professor Felicia Etzkorn in the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Tech will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the molecular forces that cause formation of the collagen triple helix, while leading to interesting new materials with potential bioengineering applications. Collagen?s unique macroscopic properties of strength and flexibility make it an attractive target for mimicry. The basic sequence of collagen that promotes triple helix formation is: glycine-proline-hydroxyproline (Gly-Pro-Hyp). Both Gly-Pro and Xaa-Hyp sequences are required to be in the trans conformation for the triple helix. The materials were designed to stabilize the collagen triple helix structure by replacement of the key Gly-trans-Pro amide bond with a Gly-trans-Pro alkene isostere to decrease the entropy of folding. Peptides with alkene isostere replacements will be synthesized to elucidate the physical and structural perturbations introduced by the substitution. Polymer synthesis experiments will follow two threads: polymer length, and triple helix stabilization. These materials will be characterized for stability and for mechanical strength and biocompatibility by a collaborator, Prof. Joseph Freeman. Once stable, folded collagen-like polymers have been synthesized, alternative tripeptide monomers will be introduced including charged residues: Lys, Arg, and Glu, to bind counterions in processes similar to biomineralization<br/><br/>Professor Etkorn will make contributions to society through education, dissemination of results, and applications. Both graduate and undergraduate students will continue to be trained during their contributions to the project. The Etzkorn group has had success recruiting female, minority, and underprivileged students, each of whom has pursued a career in scientific research or professional school. This project will continue to recruit one underrepresented undergraduate student each summer through the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The primary collaborator on this project, Joseph Freeman, is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Virginia Tech who is African-American. The broader impact of this research will continue to focus on applications of these new materials in bioengineering, and be disseminated through presentations at national meetings, publication of original research, and review articles in high quality journals, and patent applications. The results of this basic research into the fundamental properties of collagen, and the development of synthetic collagen-inspired materials are expected to lead to new and exciting applications."

This transport process is essential for optimal plant growth and health, as transport activity affects the accumulation of nutrients in edible parts of the plant, such as seeds and tubers. Grains used as feedstock are often low in protein and essential amino acids, which need to be supplemented at cost to the farmers. Reliance on a single staple food (maize, cassava, rice) is common in the developing world, and often leads to malnutrition because these plant organs are poor in protein and/or essential amino acids. Increasing the capacity of plants to export nitrogen nutrients to edible parts of the plant is expected to lead to more nutritious food containing more protein, and is hence a highly desirable trait. The team led by Okumoto has developed biosensors for glutamine, the amino acid plants mainly use for the export of nitrogen from leaves to edible parts. By using this sensor, the team aims at discovering genes responsible for glutamine export from plant cells. The discovered genes will further be analyzed by Pilot and Okumoto, whose expertise areas are in the transport process of plants. Selected genes will be used for creating plants that are more efficient in nitrogen transport to the storage organs.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Plants are familiar to all of us as sources of food, fiber and fuel. Since the process of nitrogen export has an impact on plant growth, and their quality and quantity as food source, this is a great topic to stimulate the interest of high school students and engage them in early scientific research activities. Dolan is the principal investigator of the Partnership for Research and Education in Plants (supported by a Science Education Partnership Award from the National Center for Research Resources). Through this program, high school students conduct authentic scientific research by challenging Arabidopsis mutants with various treatments that have not been tested previously. Okumoto, Pilot and Dolan will collaborate with high school students to investigate the roles of genes discovered through this project. To increase diversity in the academic environment, undergraduate and graduate researchers from underrepresented groups will be recruited through the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program at Virginia Tech, with whom Okumoto has an established relationship as a participating mentor."

Many of these pathogens can deliver proteins into the cytoplasm of their host cells to disable host immunity; these proteins are called effectors. The mechanism by which these proteins enter host cells is poorly understood. The investigators have shown that oomycete and fungal effector proteins can enter host cells without the aid of any pathogen-encoded machinery, but instead rely on short amino acid sequences in the N-termini called RXLR motifs. The investigators have discovered that the RXLR motifs can bind a class of membrane lipids called phosphoinositides. In this project, the investigators will test whether binding of the effectors to phosphoinositides is actually responsible for transferring the effectors into host cells. They will identify which host phosphoinositides are utilized by the effectors, and they will characterize the mechanism of binding. Finally they will test whether it is possible to block effector entry and so prevent disease. An extremely wide range of the most destructive plant pathogens, including those causing wheat rust, rice blast, grape powdery mildew and potato late blight depend on effectors. Understanding effector entry and determining how to block it would provide an entirely new approach to treating this broad class of diseases. Treatment of animal diseases caused by fungi, oomycetes and some parasites may also be treatable by this approach. This project will train two graduate students and provide summer research opportunities for multi-cultural undergraduate students."

When they are not, the consequences can be adverse: contexts marked by poorly formed social relationships can correlate to interethnic conflict. Conversely, social cohesion and cooperation among diverse individuals and groups can have positive social impacts (for example, such contexts can become important trade centers). This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous scientific fieldwork in the study of language and culture, asks what linguistic anthropological evidence exists to explain how cooperation between linguistically and culturally diverse individuals and groups emerges. <br/><br/>Mr. Nikolas Sweet under the supervision of Dr. Judith Irvine of the University of Michigan will how explore interpersonal relationships are formed in heteroglossic, dynamic contexts. This project questions what sociolinguistic evidence exists to explain how cooperation and cohesion is achieved among diverse individuals and groups. The research takes place in a formerly marginalized region in Senegal on the Guinea border, a context once characterized by interethnic conflict which has now become the site of significant trade, transportation, artisanal gold mining, and in-migration from all across Senegal and West Africa. As such, it is a novel site for a sociolinguistic study of how multilingual speakers from diverse backgrounds develop interpersonal relationships. This is a two-phase project that compares a rural context and large regional center, with the aim of exploring differences in the communicative practices between urban and rural centers, and how access to trade networks impacts language use. Through an in-depth study of face-to-face conversations in multiple languages between differentially positioned individuals, this project will be able to investigate how ethnic and national associations--categories that are too often taken for granted--are in fact negotiated in verbal interactions. Finally, this project contributes to understandings of how proximity to national borders affects individuals' linguistic practices."

This IREU takes a non-traditional approach by connecting U.S. students with undergraduate research experiences throughout Europe and Asia while reciprocally, at no cost to US National funding agencies, international students will be placed into summer U.S. Materials Research REU sites. For 2014-2016, partner institutions include the National University of Singapore (NUS), the Universita degli Studi di Perugia (Italy), and the University of Strathclyde (Scotland, UK) all offering substantial research projects with a high potential for resulting publications. Nine U.S. students from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and from institutions with limited access to research (three to each international site) will be recruited nationally to participate in this ten-week IREU program. Conversely, international students from the three international sites are placed throughout existing NSF DMR sponsored REU programs in the U.S., nurturing the global networks of these domestic programs. Participants are matched with research mentors and projects with a focus on materials science for sustainable energy. All IREU participants present their research at the Spring American Chemical Society National Meeting; prepare an official abstract; create and present a research poster; consider ethical issues of research; gain respect for scientific professionalism, other cultures, and collaboration; and communicate scientific findings. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The globalization of science requires students to graduate with practical laboratory experiences, multicultural understanding, and an international perspective in order to compete in the global marketplace. All three are abilities that U.S. employers feel are lacking in the current crop of recent graduates (2008 Association of American Colleges and Universities employer survey). Clearly, a need exists to improve these skills but the rigorous course load for students in materials science-related degrees makes it difficult to study abroad during the academic year. Summer research allows students to gain international experience without disrupting their studies; increases national competiveness, innovation, and knowledge base; and assists in solving challenges of a global scope (e.g., energy, health, food/water). The ACS international research experiences for undergraduates (IREU) program funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Materials Research (DMR) yearly connects nine U.S. materials science students, recruited nationally from diverse backgrounds and institutions, with research experiences at recognized producers of scientific knowledge in Singapore; Glasgow, Scotland; and Perugia, Italy. While fostering intellectual growth and maturity, the IREU experience is intended to catalyze student's desire to enroll in advanced degree programs, instill a respect for other cultures and science professionalism, and provide an appreciation for the global scientific enterprise. Reciprocally, at no cost to U.S. institutions or funders, international students are matched to and placed at domestic DMR sponsored REU sites to nurture international dimensions and establish additional networks at these host universities."

The area of focus is electron interactions with molecules of biological and technological significance. As part of the research, a novel method of accurately measuring the basic collision parameters will be applied. The project involves the investigation of elastic scattering of low-energy electrons, i.e., collisions in which the electrons scatter without losing any energy, as well as inelastic scattering, in which the electrons lose kinetic energy and in turn impart energy to the target molecule. Investigations of the production of negatively charged fragment ions by very low energy electrons that attach themselves to the molecule, causing it to break apart will also be carried out. Such technologically and biologically relevant molecules as methanol, ethanol, water, and the DNA bases will be the subjects of the research. The research to be undertaken will enhance the understanding of electron transport and electron-driven chemistry in biosystems and will aid in understanding electron-initiated reactions, such as spark or plasma ignition, in alcohol-fueled engines.<br/><br/>This collaborative project has a strong pedagogical component.

Her research will take place in San Diego, focusing on students in a competitive, after-school program that admits 45 poor students a year to prepare them for college. None of the students' parents attended college and three-fourths of them do not speak English. The goal of the research is to understand how Mexican youth enter into U.S. social, economic, and political life. Building on the theoretical notion of cultural citizenship, which recognizes that immigrants often maintain connections to the home country while simultaneously becoming part of their new country, the research will assess whether and how these ongoing connections to Mexico may be beneficial or detrimental. Preliminary research on the process of adjusting suggests that the deepened perspectives arising from bilingualism and cross-cultural awareness may actually situate Mexican second-generation youth well for success as adults in the multicultural United States of the globalized 21st century. <br/><br/>Getrich will use a mixed method research strategy, including participant observation, free listing techniques, a population survey, a household census, focus groups, and semi-structured interviews. Photovoice, an innovative technique through which the youth photographically document everyday life conditions in their community, will be employed to prompt critical discussion of issues that affect the youth and their families<br/><br/>This research is important because second-generation immigrant youth are the fastest growing segment of the population and a group that will soon be maturing into a demographically significant portion of the adult population of the United States. Dynamics both within the United States and globally make it imperative to develop a better understanding of how Mexican and other immigrant children forge pathways of social, economic, and political inclusion into U.S. society."

This research examines how political discourses, borders, local history, and urban segregation are dynamically related to the concept of convivencia (""cohabitation"" or ""living together"") in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta on the North African coast of Morocco; where self identified musulmanes (""Muslims"") and cristianos (""Christians"") have lived for centuries on different sides of a series of cultural, political, and economic rifts. Two research questions are posed: First, how do political leaders in Ceuta differently construct discourses of convivencia, and what is the relationship between discourses of convivencia and legislative processes? Second, what is the nature of relationships between musulmanes and cristianos, and what accounts for variations in these relationships? The research methods for this project include informal and formal interviews with ordinary citizens and political leaders, participant observation, digital recordings of oral histories, text analysis, and archival research. This study furthers our understandings of local politics at international borders, and contributes to theoretical issues in anthropology and political philosophy concerning debates over multiculturalism and liberal democratic forms of governance.<br/>Broader impacts: Knowing how multiculturalism is politically negotiated at the borderlands of the European Union is important for policymakers and social scientists elsewhere trying to grasp the dynamics of governance and multicultural politics."

With a remarkably growing array of techniques, seismic studies are using this phenomenon to detect new structural features in the Earth?s crust and mantle in all types of active and past tectonic settings, including subduction zones, arcs, collisional orogens, active transform faults, and large-scale extensional systems. However, confident interpretations of these features are hampered by the incomplete knowledge of the tectonic processes that govern the development and preservation of seismic anisotropy. This project is utilizing field- and laboratory-based analyses to explore three topical areas that impact the evolution of seismic anisotropy in crustal rocks: 1) prograde and retrograde chemical reactions (metamorphism), 2) the competing roles of different minerals, and 3) the influence of strain type, magnitude, and multiple deformation structures. The goal is to generate predictable relationships between deformation, metamorphism, and seismic anisotropy in crustal rocks that can be further tested by seismic observations and simulations. Such information will lead to increased understanding of seismic images which will allow a better understanding of crustal architecture and interpretation of tectonic processes. <br/><br/>Seismic anisotropy is fundamentally a microstructural phenomenon best understood by crossing traditional boundaries between geology and physics. While graduate students will be involved during the academic year, the undergraduate component of the project during summers will focus on the University of Colorado?s Research Experiences in Solid Earth Sciences for Students (RESESS) program, the goal of which is to increase the number of students from underrepresented minority populations entering graduate school in the Earth sciences. The role of this project in the program is designed to positively impact both individual RESESS students and the group as a whole through 1) science mentoring, 2) an annual two-day Front Range multi-disciplinary field trip on Colorado geology, geomorphology, and geophysics for all RESESS interns, and 3) providing a summer fellowship for a graduate student to work with all the interns to provide feedback and to help develop their science presentation skills. The broader goal in this project is to expose graduate and undergraduate students to cross-disciplinary science models and multi-cultural research communities, in as many ways as possible, in order to better prepare these Earth scientists of the future for research challenges in the 21st century."

BRIGE awards further the broaden participation of engineering researchers by increasing the number of engineering graduates, by improving the representation of women and minorities in engineering, and by understanding how to improve recruitment and retention of engineering students.<br/><br/>This BRIGE project will research mechanical circulatory assist for single ventricles for patients affected by congenital heart defects. Single ventricle heart defects are the leading cause of death among birth defects in the first year of life. Those patients who survive surgical palliation, which is achieved in three separate, staged operations, face lifelong physical limitations and morbidity. The end result of surgical palliation is a ?man-made? physiology, which consists of a single functional ventricle to drive blood flow through the systemic circulation and no right ventricle to pump venous return through the lungs. The compliant venous circulation must adapt to a higher pressure for blood to flow passively through the lungs. Researchers have recently theorized that a pump designed to augment flow from through the cavopulmonary connection would reverse the pathophysiology of the univentricular circulation. While no blood pump is currently available for cavopulmonary assist, researchers are aggressively pursuing various designs for this application. Two fundamental questions, however, have not been addressed: 1) which type of blood pump is ideal for cavopulmonay assist, and 2) what biofluid dynamic conditions are superior for pressure augmentation in the cavopulmonary connection. To address these questions, the PI plans to conduct a study 1) characterizing the interaction of blood pumps in a simulated cavopulmonary connection using boundary conditions of pre-swirl and post-swirl, continuous and physiologic puslatile flow dynamics; 2) performing laser measurements in a prototype of the cavopulmonary connection and a selected blood pump configuration to validate numerical predictions; and 3) conducting a blood bag experiment to measure the hemolytic levels produced from the interaction of the cavopulomonary connection and mechanical assist. The PI will use Computational Fluid Dynamic modeling, quantitative laser flow measurements, and hemolysis testing to help resolve critical questions regarding mechanical assist to patients with failing single ventricle physiology. The combination of intravascular intervention and biological tissue engineering offers considerable and multiple advantages in the development of new biodevices with the superior characteristics of hydraulic efficiency, percutaneous placement, and biocompatibility.<br/><br/>The PI seeks to enhance participation of women and minority students at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) by providing an opportunity to work on a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional bioengineering research project addressing a complex and significant human health problem. Since the VCU School of Engineering is located in a multicultural urban setting, the PI will recruit students from underrepresented minorities to work on this project. The PI will also actively recruit underrepresented students through VCU?s Office of Minority Affairs. The PI will integrate the project design approach and concepts into a freshman level course and will disseminate the research results through journal and conference publications with student authorship. <br/><br/>This BRIGE grant will broaden the participation of and increase opportunities for all engineers including those from groups underrepresented in the engineering disciplines. This BRIGE grant will also encourage the PI to become actively and competitively engaged in research as an independent investigator."

Hosts of new sensors and experimental techniques are driving this data flood. And while the transformational potential on science is understood, the reality of managing the data flows from collection through to analysis, especially integration with other data, insights, plus education, and outreach has not kept pace. A continuum of approaches exist for data archiving, publishing and sharing: from the single investigator with limited technical skills, or limited personal interest in archiving or sharing data, to the highly structured ecological observatory with an IT (Information Technology) department and the explicit goal of archiving data and making them accessible to researchers who were not involved in the sampling (e.g. NEON). Grassroots organizations like GLEON (the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network) share many similarities with the single investigator approach without major IT support, but recognize data sharing as a mandatory first step to answer pressing research questions addressing climate and land-use change, diminishing ecosystem services, and large scale disruptions of ecosystem functioning on a global scale. It is proposed to collaborate with other groups invested in the area of environmental observations data management and develop a design and implementation plan for a data publishing and sharing system that will address not only GLEON?s needs but also those of environmental research communities that find themselves in a similar place along the outlined data management continuum, of which there is a growing number. We will leverage GLEON?s experience, organizational structure, community trust, and recognized need for data sharing, Our approach will be primarily based on deploying and testing technology components created by CUAHSI, DataONE, LTER, and DataTurbine in a prototype setting and to assess their applicability in the GLEON community through targeted focus groups. The intellectual merits are twofold. First, prototyping and testing of existing technologies by our community members will provide valuable feedback to the original creators of the technology. Second, and most importantly, through our efforts, our community will develop a design and implementation plan for a data publishing and sharing system that is not only well conceived and sustainable, but owned and manageable by our community members, with potential implementation by dozens, if not hundreds, of ecological observatories. Broader impact: This community is an international and multi-cultural grassroots organization based on the recognized need for collaboration, as very typical in the current and future landscape of environmental research approaches. Therefore, a community level data publishing and sharing design and implementation plan that considers aspects typical for these research approaches will benefit many other international grassroots research and education collaborations, and the approach will be transformational in developing such global infrastructures. Aspects of primary importance are governance, sustainability, buy-in, trust, appropriate credit, and last but not least, usability. Finally, during the evaluation phase many researchers and students will be exposed to and trained in the use of technology that is currently available to them, even if in the end it is not considered appropriate for the entire community."

Synechococcus are aquatic/marine cyanobacteria that substantially contribute to global primary productivity. This project will employ two main approaches to study Synechococcus defenses against protist predators. Experiments will examine the mechanism(s) by which cell surface proteins provide a constitutive (continuously expressed) defense and assay the generality of this defense among Synechococcus strains and against diverse predator types. Secondly, co-culture techniques, in which Synechococcus are grown in the presence of predators, will be used to characterize protein-based induced defenses that may arise in response to predation. The formation of aggregates as a possible induced defense by Synechococcus will also be examined in field and laboratory settings. Aggregate formation is important for the biogeochemistry and ecological functioning of planktonic communities since aggregates can be the site of unique biogeochemical processes. The research is cross-cutting on a number of levels: it examines constitutive and induced defenses in both controlled laboratory and natural settings; it leverages the suite of available Synechococcus genomes to enable a mechanistic investigation of microbial defense processes; and it represents a synthesis of ecological and genomic approaches to the study of microbial interactions that are fundamental to biogeochemical cycling and the maintenance of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this project include support of graduate and undergraduate students, including ethnic minority participants in Shannon Point Marine Center's Multicultural Initiatives in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP).

The stiff rocking core (SRC) has the potential to redistribute seismic forces along the core height to create a more uniform building drift distribution. Concentrated ductility demands on a single story can develop due to a number of reasons that may or may not be foreseeable in initial design. For buildings that do not have adequate seismic ductility and/or strength, added energy dissipating devices, such as steel yielding devices or viscous dampers, can be implemented between the SRC and the existing framing to reduce these demands. Implementation of the elastic SRC adds the potential for re-centering of the building and is expected to be a cost-effective and an architecturally flexible rehabilitation technique. This research will investigate the behavior of the SRC and its interaction with existing framing that includes low-rise and mid-rise, braced frame and moment frame buildings to understand the key parameters for effective rehabilitative design of substandard frames. Advanced analytical studies will be performed to investigate the behavior and assess the effectiveness of the SRC for a range of parameters. A key component of the research includes near full-scale experimental hybrid testing of a three-story frame at the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) facility at the UB. The hybrid testing technique will allow for computational modeling of the existing substandard framing and experimental testing of the SRC with added passive energy dissipation. The testing is critical for understanding the interaction between the existing framing and SRC and for verifying implementation issues at or near full-scale. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse data repository at http://www.nees.org.<br/><br/>This research will generate key knowledge needed to implement this rehabilitation technique, which is both economical and sustainable, for substandard building structures in moderate and high seismic regions. The analytical and experimental results and design guidelines developed will be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the seismic design community. Through technology transfer via the Project Advisory Committee, the research outcomes will have an immediate impact on practice. Through collaboration with the Cal Poly Multicultural Engineering Program, the project will engage students from underrepresented groups to give them experience with structural engineering research and laboratory experimentation, ultimately helping to promote diversity in engineering and science and developing the next generation of engineers.

Differentiation of pluripotent germ cells into mobile sperm requires transcriptional regulation of specific genes. Simultaneously, sperm nuclear basic proteins, such as histone variants, replace somatic histones to achieve tightly compacted sperm DNA. In preliminary studies, the first known C. elegans sperm nuclear basic protein, a histone H2A variant called HTAS-1, was identified and found to be required for optimal fertility. Preliminary data from DNA microarray analyses identified both activated and repressed genes in htas-1 mutants compared with wild-type animals. Strikingly, genes that are activated in htas-1 mutants function in forming germ cells via gamete formation progression, oocyte maturation, ovulation, sperm signaling, and sperm migratory behavior. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this project is that HTAS-1 incorporation modulates the expression of genes that work in concert for optimal fertility in sperm. To test this, germ cell progression, oocyte development, and sperm behavior will be assessed to determine how each contributes to reduced fertility in htas-1 mutants. To identify direct targets of HTAS-1 transcriptional regulation, Dr. Chu and her colleagues will define sites of HTAS-1 incorporation during sperm development using chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA microarray analysis. To elucidate how HTAS-1 both activates and represses transcription, characterization of PTMs on HTAS-1 will be initiated using mass spectrometry to understand how HTAS-1 function is regulated at gene targets. The research in this CAREER project is significant because it elucidates mechanisms of transcriptional regulation through incorporation of a sperm-specific histone variant that functions in a conserved developmental process, sperm production.<br/><br/>The project will define evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that regulate how changes in DNA packaging alter the expression of genes important for sperm formation. It has important and broad impact because it contributes to the career development of underrepresented minority and female students at San Francisco State University, an undergraduate minority-serving institution. To boost both basic and scientific writing skills in multicultural students, Dr. Chu will develop a graduate course in scientific proposal writing that is coordinated with tutoring in basic writing skills through collaboration with the English Department and Learning Assistance Center at SFSU. Thus the project integrates the participation of students into basic research on chromatin biology and reproduction and also provides resources to help promote their long-term professional development in science."

This program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in an effort to introduce them to scientific research so as to encourage their continued engagement in the nation's scientific research and development enterprise. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects designed especially for the purpose. The REU program is a major contributor to the NSF's goal of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce. The Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) sciences Directorate awarded this REU Site grant to Quinnipiac University for the BAKOTA REU Site field-school to offer a multicultural and multidisciplinary environment for students from underrepresented groups and under-resourced institutions to receive training in scientific research and publication. Working with Hungarian students and colleagues, American students receive the theoretical background, hands-on experience and the careful attention of individual mentors required for mastering the increasingly specialized STEM methods leading archaeological research. Each summer, ten undergraduate students are engaged in 1) working next to Hungarian students while they receive instruction in survey and excavation techniques, record keeping and data management, and artifact analysis, 2) participating in seminars and workshops taught by experts on archaeological method and theory and the cultural history of Eastern Europe, 3) visiting museums and archaeological sites, 4) planning and completing an independent research project with a faculty mentor, and 5) living in the small town of Vszt and learning about life in Hungary from the villagers, Hungarian students, and visiting project participants. Students are guided (via formal instruction and informal mentoring) from dependent to independent thinkers who have the skill sets to make their own unique contributions to the research team. Students present their work at a national conference, in academic journals, and on the project website (http://bakota.net). By engaging students who would not otherwise participate in high-level research, the BAKOTA field-school opens the door to further student inquiry in science, and supports collaborations that will impact the students throughout their academic and professional careers. The international experience of the project requires a culturally sensitive atmosphere and results in participants who promote a more tolerant, educated, and collaborative society. <br/><br/>In this REU Site project, undergraduate students become contributing members of an archaeological project centered on understanding the rise of social inequality in European prehistory. A number of significant social transformations occur in the Bronze Age, including agricultural intensification, population increases, and an explosion in trade. The location of the field-school in eastern Hungary has evidence for many forms of social complexity, but unlike neighboring areas, it did not undergo massive changes in social stratification. Despite an increasing population and intensified agricultural production, no hierarchy or monopoly over bronze manufacturing emerged. This makes eastern Hungary a fascinating place to study social change. By comparing the trajectory of Bronze Age peoples of the Carpathian Basin to those of stratified societies elsewhere in the world, we engage the large anthropological debates focused on understanding the foundations and development of social inequality. The Bronze Age Krs Off-Tell Archaeological (BAKOTA) REU Site field-school has three years of funding for a summer field school at the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1500 BC) cemetery and settlement of Bks 103, located in southeastern Hungary. Professional development mentoring takes place before the program starts, throughout the research season, and post-project. Participants also receive training in ethical and equitable fieldwork codes of conduct, including Responsible Conduct in Research (RCR) and sexual harassment awareness. NSF's International Science and Engineering (ISE) program has co-funded this project."

When issues of social context have been considered, they have traditionally been argued to occur after sentence meaning has been computed. However, recent research suggests that larger contextual factors, such as world-knowledge and speaker-knowledge, are integrated during sentence interpretation by the same cognitive processes that support lexical-semantic integration. What remains relatively unknown and unexplored is how sociolinguistic variation is perceived during on-line speech processing. This study uses multiple methodologies to investigate language attitude and its relationship to language processing. The present study measures changes in brain activity using electrophysiological scalp recordings (i.e. event-related potentials) to assess the real-time integration of sentences that differ along well-defined sociolinguistic variables. In addition, the researchers make use of a novel behavioral technique -- the implicit attitude test -- to characterize the implicit attitudes and social meanings associated with specific sociolinguistic variables. Finally, direct field recording of participants is used to measure the degree of sociolinguistic variation evident in our participants' speech. Multiple linear regression models will be fitted to the data to elucidate the relationship between individual patterns of production and language attitude with electrophysiological measures of language perception. In this work they seek to understand the cognitive processes that support the perception of sociolinguistic variation during on-line language processing and the degree to which implicit sociolinguistic knowledge and native patterns of variation contribute to the processing of this variation. In our increasingly multicultural and multilingual world, an understanding of how we perceive language, dialects, and linguistic variation and the relationship these features have to language attitude, plays an increasingly important role in shaping social behavior and policy.<br/><br/>In human communication, in addition to the words we utter, how we choose to say something often carries social significance and meaning. For example, a speaker may report to his boss: ""Last weekend I went hunting and fishing"" while the same speaker talking amongst peers might say: ""Las' weeken' I went huntin' an' fishin'."" In informal conversational registers, speakers will more often delete word final t/d and drop their g's from progressive verbs than in more formal speech. Importantly, the manner in which an utterance is spoken and the frequency of sociolinguistic variables can influence how the speaker is perceived (e.g., educated vs. uneducated; aloof vs. friendly). Linguists have identified the systematic social, stylistic, and linguistic constraints that modulate the production of sociolinguistic variation. These include linguistic factors, such as lexical class and phonological environment, as well as external factors, such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Although there is a relative wealth of data on variation in language production, studies on variation perception have been much more limited. As speech perception is a fundamental aspect of human communication, the study of how individuals perceive, process, and represent linguistic variation is of inherent scientific interest. The study of variation perception can provide valuable evidence of how language intersects with attitude in shaping social stereotypes, prejudice, and behavior. The way we perceive variation and the social attitudes it engenders affects every one of us, from the recent child immigrant to the aspiring politician. As such, the study of variation perception and language attitude has important implications for education, law, and public policy."

In this project, a research team at the University of Colorado at Boulder will develop improved numerical models to better predict the rate of Southern Ocean carbon uptake over the next several decades to centuries. This will require a thorough understanding of the variable and changing carbonate chemistry of the Southern Ocean, including better constraints on the present-day mean state and seasonal cycle, quantification of past variability, and characterization of key processes driving change in the future. The primary numerical tool for this project will be the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a state-of-the-art Earth system model with fully interactive marine ecosystem and global carbon modules. Output from hindcast and 21st century CESM simulations, hydrographic data, and satellite data products will be used to understand model biases, interpret variability, and quantify carbon-climate feedback strength. <br/><br/>The specific objectives are to: (1) analyze biases in, and guide improvement of, the Southern Ocean alkalinity cycle in the CESM; (2) quantify multi-decadal changes in modeled Southern Ocean carbonate chemistry over the last 60 years, and validate these trends with satellite and hydrographic data sets; (3) identify drivers of interannual to multi-decadal variability in Southern Ocean carbonate chemistry; and (4)quantify carbon feedbacks in the Southern Ocean due to changes in acidification, stratification, and wind-driven circulation. <br/><br/>By quantifying past variability in the inorganic carbonate chemistry of the Southern Ocean, and identifying the physical and ecological processes that modify carbonate chemistry here, this project will offer new insights into the changing rate of Southern Ocean carbon uptake and acidification. The vast user base of the CESM stands to benefit from the proposed improvements in the representation of biogeochemistry and ecology in the CESM. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research will lead to a better understanding of the future evolution of the global carbon-climate system, which is of direct benefit to society. Results from this work will be widely disseminated in the scientific community through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at scientific meetings. It will support an early-career scientist and the development of her research group. The PI is a mentor for the Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training program at her home institution, which aims to provide hands-on experience in research and an introduction to graduate education to undergraduate students who are members of racial/ethnic groups severely underrepresented in science, math, and engineering. The project will support the education and training of two graduate students.

Key US and Colombian LACCEI members, and pedagogical experts in the US and Colombia will meet to develop a regional/ national teacher training program targeting STEM teachers and university professors teaching 6th grade through the first two years of undergraduate. The Program Development Workshop consists of two parts. The first is to conduct a Train the Trainers workshop for the participants to acquire knowledge of the technology and pedagogy being implemented through Shodor in conjunction with techniques and technologies being developed by the ONDAS program at COLCIENCIAS (NSF counterpart); pedagogical experts in Colombia from the National Pedagogical University; and the research group EDUCING from ACOFI (the Colombian Engineering Faculty Association- Dr. Eduardo Selva, Executive Director). The second part is on the development of a teacher training program in Colombia in the identified approaches and technologies that can scale regionally or nationally. By conducting this workshop in a Hispanic environment, it is anticipated that Noyce scholars and U.S. researchers will learn about multicultural issues that affect motivation of minorities to participate in STEM; new materials would be available in Spanish and English. The exposure of interaction in situation of multiple languages and multiple cultures sensitizes participants and further globalizes them. The interaction provides collaboration among the U.S. and Colombian teachers trained in the program, providing international collaboration activities within their classroom and affecting the globalization of the students. The materials will also be available and disseminated through Shodor's National Computational Science Institute and its Computational Science Education Reference Desk, a Pathway portal of the National Science Digital Library to all schools implementing the NSF Noyce Teacher Scholarship and Fellowship program.

In six experiments that integrate behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) methods, this approach analyzes how the details people remember for visual images differ across cultures. The lens of culture can direct preferred modes of processing and/or attention to particular features of the environment, and this will affect what is remembered. In a comparison of East Asian, Turkish, and Western (i.e., American) cultures, Angela Gutchess of Brandeis University will examine cultural differences in exactly what people remember. Americans are predicted to remember more specific details due to their preferential attention to features. In contrast, the groups will be well-matched on general memory, which is not dependent upon attention to features. Predicted cultural differences in memory should reflect the use of intentional strategies, and directing people's attention to specific, relevant features should reduce cross-cultural differences in memory. Furthermore, aging, which reduces the availability of cognitive capacities to deploy strategies and process details in explicit memory, should reduce cross-cultural differences in memory specificity. In contrast, for implicit memory, cultural differences in memory for specific details will continue to be observed because the development of implicit memories is not thought to depend on cognitive capacity. Functional neuroimaging methods will provide converging evidence for cultural differences in memory specificity, and identifying neural regions will help the PI to distinguish between different theoretical accounts for why people from different cultures remember things differently. <br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the proposal include examining cultural differences across both explicit and implicit memory, which are thought to be separable memory systems. To date, the majority of research findings on memory are based on Western populations, meaning that theories of memory may largely characterize Westerners and may not generalize to other populations. The study of cultural differences will lead to a more inclusive field of psychology, with a better understanding of which memory principles are universals vs. are culture-dependent. The proposed work will make substantial advances in understanding the mechanisms of cross-cultural differences in memory specificity by employing a multimethod approach using sensitive memory measures, including neuroimaging. <br/><br/>By studying memory in a multicultural world, the proposed studies may contribute to better cross-cultural understanding as well as better scientific understanding. Little work has investigated cultures outside of the East/West dichotomy. If the nature of memory formation differs across cultures, this could help people better understand why people from Eastern and Western cultures often view the world differently because what we remember powerfully shapes what we believe. In legal settings, for example, people who remember more details of the situation in which a crime was committed may hold a perpetrator less responsible than people who focus solely on (and disproportionately remember) the perpetrator's actions. Diverse populations will also be included in this research through international collaboration and participation of non-Westerners in the proposed research. This will provide a training ground for young scientists across international sites and heightening their awareness of the impact of culture on psychological processes. Finally, the work will be broadly disseminated through participation in international conferences as well as science outreach programs."

The goal of this pilot study is to<br/>explore the influence of science fiction in shaping the intellectual development of scientists and<br/>engineers, especially during their formative years. This project meets the requirements for a Small Grant<br/>for Exploratory Research (SGER) because it constitutes preliminary work on untested and novel ideas.<br/>Specifically, it proposes to explore the idea that science fiction influences the career choices and research<br/>trajectories of scientists and engineers, a notion for which anecdotal support can be mobilized yet which<br/>has never been substantiated through empirical research. This pilot study will serve as the foundation for<br/>a larger proposal for an NSF Scholars Award to conduct follow-up research on the relationship between<br/>technoscience and science fiction.<br/>This project emerges at the intersection of the fields of science and technology studies (STS) and<br/>library and information science (LIS), and seeks to explore how exposure to science fiction influences the<br/>career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. In so doing, it merges the theoretical<br/>strand of the social shaping of technoscience from the STS literature with work on mass media in the life<br/>of the reader/listener/viewer/visitor/player from the field of LIS. The project is made possible by the<br/>hybrid expertise of the PI, whose Ph.D. is in STS and whose current faculty position is in LIS, and who<br/>has previously conducted NSF-funded research projects on the ethical implications of values embedded in<br/>information technologies such as dissection simulations and computational models. This project will<br/>allow the PI to further his research agenda at the intersection of the fields of STS and LIS, and to conduct<br/>research that will make significant contributions to both fields.<br/>The three primary objectives of this study are to develop a more robust understanding of the<br/>relationship between technoscience and society, mass media, and science fiction. This study hypothesizes<br/>that the career choices and research decisions of scientists and engineers are influenced by science fiction<br/>as well as other mass media and social factors as a whole.<br/>Data collection includes ten semi-structured, open-ended interviews with scientists and engineers.<br/>Interview data will be analyzed using grounded theory such that research findings will be continuously<br/>integrated to further refine the research design, leading to the construction of a theory that can provide a<br/>preliminary explanation how society, mass media, and science fiction influence scientists and engineers<br/>and which can be tested and refined through additional research. Results will be disseminated via<br/>academic conferences and peer reviewed journals.<br/>Intellectual Merit: This study will contribute to the STS literature by exploring the social factors that<br/>influence the career decisions and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. The contribution to the<br/>LIS literature will be detailed exploration of the relationship between technoscience and mass media<br/>through an in-depth case study of mass media in the lives of scientists and engineers as<br/>readers/listeners/viewers/visitors/players. Finally, this study will also contribute to the literature on the<br/>relationship between technoscience and science fiction by exploring if and how science fiction might<br/>influence the career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers.<br/>Broader Impacts: This study also aims to produce broader impacts that focus on the recruitment and<br/>retention of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students. First, by improving<br/>understanding of how science fiction shapes the career choices of scientists and engineers, educators will<br/>be able to determine when and how to use science fiction to promote student interest in STEM, potentially<br/>reinforcing and legitimating existing educational programs. In addition, this study may also be able to<br/>provide insights into how science fiction can promote diversity among STEM students, through emphasis<br/>on female and non-white authors and characters and feminist and multicultural themes. Finally, this study<br/>may discover ways that science fiction can help students majoring in STEM to become more conscious of<br/>the social and cultural dimensions of science and technology."

The support will be delivered in the form of a required, integrated five quarter seminar sequence. The sequence will be organized and taught by the PI, with the liberal use of guest speakers to increase the students' contact with mentors, role models, and research advisers. In addition, the students will be required to take independent research or internship credit for at least one quarter. The goals of these curricular requirements are fourfold: (1) to introduce students to research and graduate school options; (2) to assist the students in career planning, internship placement, and securing post graduate employment; (3) to broaden the students' perspectives on Mathematics and Computer Science; and (4) to allow the students to develop presentation skills while providing outreach to other students potentially interested in pursuing math and computer science degrees. <br/><br/>The sequence will include two new courses -- a Mentoring course and a Great Ideas course -- that could become a permanent part of the UO curriculum. The Mentoring course (cotaught with staff from the Careers Center) will introduce students to the use of informational interviews. The students will conduct interviews with professionals in their chosen field to assess their interest in specific careers and to ""size up"" organizations. Students can use the information they get to promote themselves to a prospective employer or to network, opening the door to future contacts and job possibilities. The course also gives students practice in presenting their findings and it gives them a chance to hear reports on all of the interviews, expanding their knowledge of related career paths. The Great Ideas course aims to broaden the students' view of Computer Science and Mathematics beyond the content of their required departmental courses. The course will consist of a series of distinguished, guest lectures from the Math and Computer Science faculty discussing the truly great ideas of the field.

Following completion of the one-year program, CCC students who successfully transition to Cal receive support to continue research on faculty-sponsored projects. Four core components comprise the ELP: (1) an intensive field program that introduces methods of scientific inquiry and empirical thinking; (2) an environmental science education component enlisting CCC and CNR students as educators in local high schools; (3) a case study course in which CCC participants work with CNR undergraduates to engage in interdisciplinary environmental science research projects; and (4) a two-month laboratory research experience that engages CCC participants as research assistants on CNR faculty sponsored projects to develop the students' field and laboratory skills. A webGIS platform facilitates communication between participants and archives digital records of ELP participant findings. For the long-term this project expects to facilitate the transition of an additional 40 students annually to 4-year baccalaureate programs in STEM disciplines. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its investigation of two kinds of complexity: the difficult issues that surround urban environmental and resource management, and the barriers to underrepresented groups' entry into STEM disciplines. Both issues are addressed by ELP's activities that make participation in scientific research real and relevant in underserved communities. The project's broader impacts are being felt through the opportunities for the CNR and CCC student communities to gain hands on experience in exploring and addressing resource and environmental problems in densely populated, coastal, multi-cultural environments. This approach models a cumulative suite of collaborative strategies for academic institutions to deploy in efforts to broaden participation in STEM programs and in environmental problem solving."

This work will be undertaken under the mentorship of Professor Cindy Lee Van Dover at the Marine Laboratory of the Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University. <br/><br/>Coastal hypoxia can have negative consequences on benthic community structure and function. While the effects of hypoxia on benthic community structure are well understood, less well known are impacts to community function. At the onset of hypoxia, mobile fauna are displaced, and, as the severity and duration of hypoxia increase, community structure of non-mobile infauna degrades (i.e., loss of biodiversity, biomass, activity). Impacts of hypoxia can have ecosystem-level consequences, including reductions in benthic fisheries that depend on infauna for their nutrition (e.g., demersal fish and epibenthic crustacean predators); degradation of the infauna community also reduces bioturbation rates, altering rates of biogenic remineralization of nutrients and pollutant sequestration. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This study will take advantage of comparative systems that experience sustained (Chesapeake Bay, VA) and intermittent (Neuse River, NC) seasonal hypoxia to answer the following questions: 1) What is the relationship between hypoxia and bioturbation rates under sustained and intermittent conditions of hypoxia? This question will be addressed through 12-months of benthic observations in two systems using time-series (hourly) sediment profile imaging (SPI) and environmental sensing systems, together with monthly replicate sampling for spatial characterization of bioturbation rates (sediment profiles) and community structure (sediment grabs). Study locations will be chosen based on the history of hypoxia in each system, using data from the Chesapeake Bay Benthic Monitoring and Neuse River Estuary Modeling and Monitoring Programs of the Chesapeake Bay Program and University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's Institute of Marine Science, respectively. 2) What is the relationship between hypoxia and physiological response of key system organisms? This relationship will be examined using respirometry and gene expression methodologies in two benthic polychaete species, and will test the hypothesis that there are significant differences in response between organisms cultured from Chesapeake Bay and the Neuse River. Cultured polychaetes from each system will be put through hypoxia trials using stop-flow respirometry to determine metabolic rate, O2 extraction, and the O2 saturation level that induces mortality. Subsamples of worms will be removed and frozen at intervals in the hypoxia trials for subsequent Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing to survey for differential gene expression. 3) What is the economic cost of coastal hypoxia. The fellow will develop a bioeconomic model that explores the economic costs of hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay by relating hypoxic affects to a benthic fishery (i.e. blue crabs), and compare those results with economic valuations of hypoxia previously conducted in the Neuse River. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Research results will be disseminated in the scientific literature and will provide new knowledge useful to coastal environmental managers. The fellow will expand efforts to broaden the participation of minorities in ocean science through mentoring programs at Duke University, in the ASLO Multicultural Program, and in the annual Youth Education Summit of the National Association of Black Scuba Divers, which targets grade school minorities with an interest in ocean science."

The studies will include a survey of the genetic differences underlying the variation in resistance to TTX in different populations and species of garter snakes and a molecular genetic evaluation of the role of natural selection in the evolution of resistance. Several factors could underlie the presence of resistance in multiple populations.

Although a powerful oxidizing agent, the direct reaction of dioxygen with other molecules is slow and nature has developed ways to lower this kinetic barrier. This process of oxygen activation has tremendous importance and the understanding of the principles by which this activation is accomplished is crucial. A new tool for the study of oxygen activation was recently introduced and involves the analysis of the effects of pH, viscosity, temperature, and isotopic composition on the second order rate constant for the reaction of dioxygen with an enzyme. Such studies have already provided valuable information on the nature of the rate-determining steps in oxygen activation in a number of enzyme systems. This project describes efforts towards the elucidation of the role of the metal center in the mechanism of oxygen and substrate activation in a group of dioxygenases belonging to the cupin superfamily. Two types of enzyme systems have been chosen for initial studies: copper-and iron-containing flavonol 2,3-dioxygenases from Aspergillus flavus and Bacillus subtilis, and nickel- and iron-containing acireductone dioxygenases from Klebsiella pneumoniae. These enzymes were chosen for their unique mechanisms and the potential to provide important insights into the mechanism of oxygen and substrate activation. Understanding of the structural basis for the catalytic diversity observed in the cupin superfamily of proteins may provide the foundation for deciphering the function of new protein members.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This project incorporates tools and techniques of biochemistry, bioinformatics,molecular biology,physical and synthetic organic chemistry, in the study of the mechanism of metalloenzymes.

The current proposal seeks to understand better this cross-cultural challenge and to provide guidance for overcoming it. The PI's new ""dialect theory"" of emotion argues that different cultural groups express emotions with subtly different styles -- like different dialects of a language, such as British versus American English -- and that it is easier to understand emotions expressed in a familiar style. Because this is an area of intense current debate, the current proposal consists of a series of studies to test the specific mechanisms proposed by this new dialect theory, by examining cultural differences in the expression and judgment of spontaneous facial expressions, vocal tones, and body language. This research is timely and relevant for providing the data to judge a controversial new theory, as well as for its potential benefits to society. The findings aim to offer guidance to cope with rapid changes in the modern society, such as increasing cultural diversity. Americans work closely with people from multiple cultural backgrounds more than was previously the case. It is important to understand the nature of communication breakdowns in multicultural environments, in order to facilitate communication breakthroughs. In addition, the project broadens participation from underrepresented groups by including Native Americans in the research process."

Much of the previous work documenting the benefits and costs of advice has been conducted in cultural contexts that place emphasis on personal independence and competence (e.g., Western Europe, North America), or on ""face"" and interpersonal harmony (e.g., East Asia). The potential costs of advice may be particularly high in these cultures. Conversely, advice may be perceived more positively in cultural contexts that place emphasis on collectively solving practical problems (e.g., Russian and African American cultures). The goal of this research project, conducted by the team of investigators from Georgetown University (Yulia Chentsova Dutton) and (Purdue University (Erina MacGeorge), is to examine cultural similarities and differences in responses to advice. In two studies, they examine how individuals from four cultures (European Americans, Chinese, Russians, and African Americans) perceive advice and respond to it in their daily lives and in the laboratory. The first study will use a daily diary method to examine how often individuals living in the United States (European Americans, Asian Americans, Russian Americans and African Americans), China and Russia give and receive advice, and how they perceive these interactions. The second study will examine supportive interactions between friends recorded in a laboratory setting, comparing how European Americans, Asian Americans, Russian Americans and African Americans give and respond to advice. Taken together, these studies will allow the researchers to shed light on the psychological and cultural variables that shape individuals' perceptions of and responses to advice. <br/><br/>As our society becomes increasingly multicultural, it is important to understand how to effectively communicate information and provide support to individuals from diverse cultural groups and thereby prevent cross-cultural communication breakdowns. Because advice serves as a key social regulation strategy for individuals' motivation, decision-making, and action, the proposed project will have broad implications for provision of information and support in a variety of domains, such as educational and organizational settings and human services."

Social interactions that ratify and shape social hierarchy can look superficially similar. This research investigates the possibility that apparent similarities may be misleading, if the social interactions simultaneously are being understood differently.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out in the region of Cuzco, Peru, chosen because it has an appropriate diversity of languages and ethnicities.

This excavation will document patterns in mortuary behavior at Abydos during the Greco-Roman period (323 BCE to c. 300 CE), and will be incorporated into a broader study of Greco-Roman period burial practices drawing on material from four other sites. The Greco-Roman period in Egypt has traditionally been understudied archaeologically, and the mortuary remains of the Greco-Roman period at Abydos have never been properly excavated and described. This research represents the first attempt to build a comprehensive, systematic picture of Greco-Roman period mortuary behavior.<br/><br/>The systematic study of burial practices is important because it provides a means of reconstructing social distinctions and identities, and hence a basis for the study of more generalized anthropological processes of social change. Because a burial is the result of choices made and performed by the survivors of the deceased within a certain set socially sanctioned behaviors, a given burial treatment is consistent with the relationship between the deceased and society. By observing the patterning of associations between variables such as body treatment, burial assemblage, and spatial organization across a large number of burials, it is possible to identify socially recognized distinctions and identities. <br/><br/>Through an analysis of regional and diachronic variation in funerary patterns, this project will address how, in the context of a complex urban society, the expression of social identities and distinctions, and the very concept of identity change and react in response to sustained cross-cultural interaction, where a non-indigenous cultural group is politically dominant. Greco-Roman period Egypt is one of the best examples from antiquity of this phenomenon: at this time Egypt was ruled by a small, non-indigenous elite, first as an independent polity and later externally as a province of the Roman Empire. <br/><br/>The results from this study will be relevant not only to the study of Egypt and the Mediterranean, but in general to studies of cross-cultural interaction in complex, multi-cultural states and empires both ancient and modern. In addition, state-level societies, particularly in the Mediterranean region, are often omitted from anthropological discussion with respect to mortuary analysis and otherwise: this research will bring a complex and valuable case study that is Greco-Roman Egypt into broader anthropological debates on how cross-cultural interaction ultimately affects social processes, facilitating anthropological discussion of the states of the Mediterranean of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The data from this excavation season will be published both as part of Tom Landvatter's dissertation and in various refereed journals; it will also be the subject of several professional and public lectures. This work will also provide both the author and several graduate students training in cemetery excavation and analysis."

Recent years' CASP experiments have seen significant progress on protein 3D structure prediction. Medium to high-resolution structures can be predicted by the state-of-the-art methodologies through the combination of comparative modeling, threading and ab initio modeling techniques. The high-resolution models can be used for the analysis of biochemical function of the molecules in cells and for virtual ligand screening. The algorithms will be further improved by combining the I-TASSER structure assemble method with the meta-server threading techniques. As a complement to the full-length I-TASSER modeling, a locally installed meta-threading server (LOMETS) will be developed for the generation of multiple threading alignments and spatial restraints. The improvements will significantly increase the capacity of the service system to serve for the community, and help improve the quality of the core algorithms which the server systems are based on. The educational activities of the award involve development of four courses in structural bioinformatics as part of a bioinformatics program at KU. The project will also develop outreach materials in protein sequence-structure-function principles and participate in an annual multicultural roadshow designed to recruit underrepresented students to KU."

Thus it comprises an appropriate case study for this research. <br/><br/>The researcher hypothesizes that three interrelated elements impact both policy implementation and safe motherhood outcomes in the rural Andes: the existence of regional cultural differences; the key position of nurse-midwives in the implementation process and their own conceptions of Andean culture and interculturalidad; and the experiences and desires of birthing women and their male partners in rural areas. The researcher will examine these elements and their effects on birth care through in-depth interviews with regional and local leaders, health service administrators, nurse midwives, and women and their male partners. The researcher will also conduct observation of prenatal consultations and will collect publicly available statistical data regarding use of intercultural birthing services.<br/><br/>The case of the Peruvian birth policy represents an opportunity to provide a more complex understanding of how cultural variables come into play in a context where cultural differences are institutionalized in policy. The results of this study also will provide a critical analysis of how the process of policy in Peru reflects and impacts social inequalities. Additionally these results will be significant for the future policy approaches to safe motherhood in other countries or regions that seek to use culture as a key construct for health policy.

The goal of this pilot study is to<br/>explore the influence of science fiction in shaping the intellectual development of scientists and<br/>engineers, especially during their formative years. This project meets the requirements for a Small Grant<br/>for Exploratory Research (SGER) because it constitutes preliminary work on untested and novel ideas.<br/>Specifically, it proposes to explore the idea that science fiction influences the career choices and research<br/>trajectories of scientists and engineers, a notion for which anecdotal support can be mobilized yet which<br/>has never been substantiated through empirical research. This pilot study will serve as the foundation for<br/>a larger proposal for an NSF Scholars Award to conduct follow-up research on the relationship between<br/>technoscience and science fiction.<br/>This project emerges at the intersection of the fields of science and technology studies (STS) and<br/>library and information science (LIS), and seeks to explore how exposure to science fiction influences the<br/>career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. In so doing, it merges the theoretical<br/>strand of the social shaping of technoscience from the STS literature with work on mass media in the life<br/>of the reader/listener/viewer/visitor/player from the field of LIS. The project is made possible by the<br/>hybrid expertise of the PI, whose Ph.D. is in STS and whose current faculty position is in LIS, and who<br/>has previously conducted NSF-funded research projects on the ethical implications of values embedded in<br/>information technologies such as dissection simulations and computational models. This project will<br/>allow the PI to further his research agenda at the intersection of the fields of STS and LIS, and to conduct<br/>research that will make significant contributions to both fields.<br/>The three primary objectives of this study are to develop a more robust understanding of the<br/>relationship between technoscience and society, mass media, and science fiction. This study hypothesizes<br/>that the career choices and research decisions of scientists and engineers are influenced by science fiction<br/>as well as other mass media and social factors as a whole.<br/>Data collection includes ten semi-structured, open-ended interviews with scientists and engineers.<br/>Interview data will be analyzed using grounded theory such that research findings will be continuously<br/>integrated to further refine the research design, leading to the construction of a theory that can provide a<br/>preliminary explanation how society, mass media, and science fiction influence scientists and engineers<br/>and which can be tested and refined through additional research. Results will be disseminated via<br/>academic conferences and peer reviewed journals.<br/>Intellectual Merit: This study will contribute to the STS literature by exploring the social factors that<br/>influence the career decisions and research trajectories of scientists and engineers. The contribution to the<br/>LIS literature will be detailed exploration of the relationship between technoscience and mass media<br/>through an in-depth case study of mass media in the lives of scientists and engineers as<br/>readers/listeners/viewers/visitors/players. Finally, this study will also contribute to the literature on the<br/>relationship between technoscience and science fiction by exploring if and how science fiction might<br/>influence the career choices and research trajectories of scientists and engineers.<br/>Broader Impacts: This study also aims to produce broader impacts that focus on the recruitment and<br/>retention of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students. First, by improving<br/>understanding of how science fiction shapes the career choices of scientists and engineers, educators will<br/>be able to determine when and how to use science fiction to promote student interest in STEM, potentially<br/>reinforcing and legitimating existing educational programs. In addition, this study may also be able to<br/>provide insights into how science fiction can promote diversity among STEM students, through emphasis<br/>on female and non-white authors and characters and feminist and multicultural themes. Finally, this study<br/>may discover ways that science fiction can help students majoring in STEM to become more conscious of<br/>the social and cultural dimensions of science and technology."

The work enables the researchers from the Front Range Computing Consortium (FRCC) to make discoveries in multiple areas through the supercomputing instrument with peak performance (over 100 TeraFLOPs). Access to this critical state-of-the-art Track 3 computational instrumentation enables HPC-driven problems such as Earth-System Sciences (e.g., climatology, critical oceanography, meteorology, land surface dynamics), Biotechnology (e.g., genomics, structural biology, microbial ecology), renewable energy applications; Material Science (e.g., nano-structured composites), turbulence, turbulent magnetic dynamos, and laser-plasma acceleration, and Computational Science. The instrument proposed combines Sun?s highest density Constellation assemblies, Intel?s next generation Nehalem-EP microprocessors, a custom InfiniBand QDR-based mesh interconnect, NVIDIA accelerators, and Sun Thumper storage modules to produce a highly balanced I/O rich, and cost-effective computing system. This new instrument, deployed within the integrated framework of the FRCC, offers a broad spectrum of investigators the necessary computational ecosystem to advance their research and strengthen their collaborations with national laboratories. Because the HPC manifested by NSF cyber-infrastructure hierarchy calls for ?a significant number of systems with peak performance in the 50-500 teraflops range, deployed and supported on the local level by individual campuses and research organizations,? the instrument fits into the NSF cyber-infrastructure hierarchy as a track 3 system and will have a software environment that allows it to peer seamlessly with other NSF cyber-infrastructure investments. Exhibiting potential to benefit other Directorates and Offices, this work undoubtedly directly benefits GEO, MPS, BIO, ENG, OCI, and CISE.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This project brings together a broad and diverse set of disciplines to focus on key research priorities. The Consortium also decreases the barrier for collaboration between researchers at institutions along the Front Range, thereby accelerating scientific discovery, increasing scientific productivity, and fostering vibrant HPC ecology. Moreover, the instrumentation facilitates focused education, training, outreach, and support. Courses offered through this initiative are a vital component of training the next generation of scientists and engineers in the areas of modeling and scientific computing, numerical analysis, applied analysis, and high performance computing. The instrumentation supports ten historically black colleges and universities through distance learning courses and leverages existing mentoring programs such as NCAR?s Summer Internship in Parallel Computational Science (SIParCS), UCAR?s Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science program (SOARS), and the CU Boulder?s Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training (SMART) programs."

The results of this study could be of use to policy-makers across the globe who are dealing with growing minority populations.<br/><br/>Mutual accommodation is a topic that has just begun to be examined by social scientists. The usual manner of studying this topic is to either use limited ethnographic studies or to use national surveys to measure attitudes. While the ethnographic studies allow one to examine causal factors, they are limited in the scenarios that can be examined. The national surveys can uncover attittudes towards groups, but it is difficult through standard survey questions to get at what actions are possible. In this study the principal investigator will be using a series of survey experiments on two surveys that will be national in scope. The survey experiments will allow the teasing out of causation in a much larger population than usual ethnographic methods. In addition, it will allow the examination of what levels of accommodation are acceptable to both sets of parties."

The Noyce Scholars receive financial support through scholarships or fellowships and mentoring support from faculty and peers, resulting in increased access to key faculty and the university support system. As first year educators, the Noyce Scholars obtain support from faculty and peers through an online networking system. Faculty advisors also mentor the new teachers during the first academic teaching year.

Viral vectors provide one system capable of delivering DNA to the nucleus of a cell. Alternative delivery systems, free of the possible adverse effects of viral infection, are of considerable interest. An alternative strategy involves complexing and condensing the negatively charged DNA with a positively charged biocompatible polymer. The resulting ""polyplex"" has been shown to be capable of entering a cell, penetrating the nucleus, and releasing some portion of the complexed DNA, thus making it available for transfection. The efficiency of this process remains low, presumably because an ionically stabilized polyplex does not readily release its DNA component. In this work the PI plans to synthesize a series of cationic polymers, similar in backbone structure but differing in their susceptibility to hydrolysis of beta-thioester, beta-aminoester, beta-amino, and thioamide linkages built into the polymer backbone. Dissociation of the polyplex, once delivered to the cell, will be facilitated by degradation of the polymer through cleavage of the susceptible linkages. Rates of degradation can in principle be tuned by adjusting the proportions of hydrolysable linkages and the substitutent patterns near such linkages. The degradation kinetics and ability to complex, condense, and protect DNA will be investigated in vitro for a library of polycations. The challenge will be to tune the hydrolytic susceptibility of the polycations so that the stability of the polyplex is retained in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. Finally the dissociation, intracellular trafficking, and in vitro transfection efficiency of the polyplexes will be investigated in selected cell lines. The polymers will be labeled with appropriate fluorescence tags to facilitate study of trafficking within the cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The work has the potential for substantial impact in the gene therapy domain. The program includes a program of educational outreach, provision of undergraduate research opportunities, and curriculum development. The PI will work with the University of Wyoming Office of Multicultural Affairs to recruit high school students from throughout the rural Rocky Mountain area (plus Nebraska and the Dakotas) to participate in a paid , seven-week Summer Apprentice Program. Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting from the substantial population of Native Americans in the region. The PI will provide opportunities for two undergraduates to work on the project in his laboratory. He is also establishing the first course in Polymer Synthesis, Engineering, and Applications on the Wyoming campus. This will include a laboratory component that incorporates experiments in various synthetic approaches, determination of polymer molecular weights and molecular weight distributions, preparation of responsive polymers, preparation and characterization of amphiphilic block copolymers, and cellular uptake of nanoparticles prepared by the students."

Documented responses by E. huxleyi to elevated pCO2 include modifications to their calcification rate and cell size, malformation of coccoliths, elevated growth rates, increased organic carbon production, lowering of PIC:POC ratios, and elevated production of the active climate gas DMS. Changes in these parameters are mechanisms known to elicit alterations in grazing behavior by microzooplankton, the oceans dominant grazer functional group. The investigators hypothesize that modifications to the physiology and biochemistry of calcifying and non-calcifying Haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi in response to elevated pCO2 will precipitate alterations in microzooplankton grazing dynamics. To test this hypothesis, they will conduct controlled laboratory experiments where several strains of E. huxleyi are grown at several CO2 concentrations. After careful characterization of the biochemical and physiological responses of the E. huxleyi strains to elevated pCO2, they will provide these strains as food to several ecologically-important microzooplankton and document grazing dynamics. E. huxleyi is an ideal organism for the study of phytoplankton and microzooplankton responses to rising anthropogenic CO2, the effects of which in the marine environment are called ocean acidification; E. huxleyi is biogeochemically important, is well studied, numerous strains are in culture that exhibit variation in the parameters described above, and they are readily fed upon by ecologically important microzooplankton.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>The implications of changes in microzooplankton grazing for carbon cycling, specifically CaCO3 export, DMS production, nutrient regeneration in surface waters, and carbon transfer between trophic levels are profound, as this grazing, to a large degree, regulates all these processes. E. huxleyi is a model prey organism because it is one of the most biogeochemically influential global phytoplankton. It forms massive seasonal blooms, contributes significantly to marine inorganic and organic carbon cycles, is a large producer of the climatically active gas DMS, and is a source of organic matter for trophic levels both above and below itself. The planned controlled study will increase our knowledge of the mechanisms that drive patterns of change between trophic levels, thus providing a wider array of tools necessary to understand the complex nature of ocean acidification field studies, where competing variables can confound precise interpretation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This research project will provide support for two early-career scientists, a graduate student, and numerous undergraduate students. Undergraduate student involvement will come largely from SPMCs long-standing two resident programs: the award-winning Multicultural Initiative in the Marine Sciences: Undergraduate Participation (MIMSUP) and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). The mission statement of the MIMSUP program is to increase diversity within the next generation of marine scientists through coursework and research. Students participating in MIMSUP conduct independent research projects, present at national and international meetings, and conduct community outreach. The REU program provides the portal for our research to reach a nation-wide audience;just last year SPMC received 118 REU applications representing 90 different universities. Undergraduates from WWUs Biology and Environmental Science departments will also participate in this research through courses taught by the project PIs. Finally, SPMC has received funding to hire a K-12 outreach coordinator who will develop a series of workshops, public lectures and presentations, and contributions to K-12 curriculum. Findings from this research will be incorporated into all of these outreach efforts."

Recent projections of future global climate changes (GCC) have given rise to grave concerns about the future of the world's coral reefs, as the thermal consequences of GCC have been predicted to intensify in the next 30-50 years. To date, our ability to gauge the vulnerability of coral reefs to global warming has been limited by our lack of knowledge about the capacity for coral symbioses to acclimatize and/or adapt to thermal stress over ecological time frames. In order to be able to predict and model how corals will respond to increasing ocean temperature anomalies, we need to begin understanding the potential mechanisms of thermal tolerance in scleractinian coral symbioses. This project will identify the genetic response of coral species to global environmental changes by looking at the molecular mechanisms behind thermal tolerance and by identifying the genetic traits under global-change-induced selection. This area of research is crucial to a complete understanding of the potential of tropical corals to survive and adapt to the rapid global climate changes that our planet is facing. <br/><br/>The use of gene expression profiling approaches, under simulated and controlled experimental settings, will allow the investigators to identify the molecular level effects that account for thermal tolerance ranges, and type of changes in gene expression is needed to achieve thermal acclimatization. This project will also use the identified candidate genes involved in the acclimatization process of thermal tolerance as genetic markers to monitor whether seawater temperature changes influence coral species at the level of DNA sequences. The nature of selection imposed by environmental changes and the potential of coral populations to respond to global climate change by evolutionary rapid adaptation will be assessed.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Coral reef ecosystems provide for the livelihood of millions of people through the tropics but their future is uncertain as we still do not fully understand the capacity of corals to respond to the new global climate changes - thus the results of this project is relevant to society. The information to be generated in this project is vital for managing the current and future coral reefs in our planet, and the findings will be disseminated both through peer reviewed publications and through presentations at national and international scientific meetings. This project represents a collaborative effort between U.S. and Australian scientists with experience in the field of molecular biology and ecology of coral and Symbiodinium symbioses. In addition, the data and methodologies generated will be transferred to both national and international students during training workshops organized in collaboration with Australian scientists through the Global Coral Reef Targeted Research & Capacity Building Project, funded by the Global Environmental Fund from the World Bank. Moreover, this project will have an immediate and significant impact by training one or two graduate and several undergraduate students in a multicultural environment that includes minorities, national and foreign students. This setting will provide young scientists a chance to participate in the development of experiments that range from molecular ecology to physiology, including both lab and marine field experiments/procedures.<br/>Rodriguez-Lanetty has recently started a new position and new laboratory in the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and part of his planned initiative is also to establish a relationship between his laboratory and the local community including teachers and students of several minority serving institutions in the region. The research in this project will be showcased in both interactions with the Louisiana schools and in guest lectures presented to community colleges and undergraduates at UL Lafayette. The effort of this initiative is aimed at transferring the details of our work to a diverse set of audiences which will promote awareness of the issues facing coral reefs worldwide."

Using techniques of legal-case analysis and socio-linguistic and narrative analysis, as well as participant observation, the investigator will study how national ex-colonial systems of law impact upon `traditional` subordinate peoples, reshaping the very identities of subordinate peoples as they try to incorporate them into a more representative socio-political system. The specific focus of the study is the Australian `Native Title Act` which attempted to provide native titles for unalienated lands, so long as the claimants could demonstrate `traditional` native identity. The project will analyze how native people cope with, resist and reshape state programs which attempt to redefine the natives into the dominant society's image. This research is important because it addresses a significant issue in our time, that of the relationship between state power and local identity. Advances in our understanding of the effects of well-meaning programs such as the Australian land title program on the cultural identities of the focus populations can help clarify issues in comparable programs such as affirmative action programs in the US, or linguistic-cultural rights issues in Canada."

In doing so, the Principal Investigators are extending the range of seismic imaging to depths below even the thickest continental crust into the mantle lithosphere, and at the same time maintaining good resolution to address first-order geologic problems. <br/><br/>They are verifying and validating two new techniques: 1) A novel approach to remove (deconvolve) complications arising from earthquake sources; and 2) through a process called ""migration"", to transform data into images of correct dimensions in distance and depth. The first method preserves all three components of seismic data -- a feat otherwise difficult to achieve. For migration, they are using the so-called Gaussian beams approach to image laterally varying, complex geologic structures. To investigate key targets of the continental lithosphere, they are starting with data from the Cascadia active continental margin. This high-quality dataset is in the public domain and has been the subject of several studies using other techniques, thus is a natural benchmark. <br/><br/>The primary focus of the research is to a recently recorded dataset from a very exciting seismic profile (""Hi-CLIMB"") across the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen -- the highest and the largest active continent-continent collision zone in the world. Chen just concluded three years of field work late last year; at elevations averaging 5,000 meters above sea-level. Over a distance of almost 800 km, the Hi-CLIMB array covers all major tectonic units of the Himalayas through central Tibet. Despite numerous obstacles, a dense station-spacing was achieved, as close as 3 km and never over 8 km, even over the high Himalayas. Furthermore, many stations are in the most remote part of Tibet where background noise is exceedingly low. The Hi-CLIMB dataset is not yet in the public domain and they expect to produce timely, exciting results regarding the deep-seated anatomy of the most majestic collision zone by matching an unprecedented dataset with new techniques. For comparative studies, two potential secondary targets are also identified. In each case, the large-scale geological setting is analogous to one of the primary targets and high-quality data from broadband arrays have been collected. <br/><br/>The researchers are making fundamental contributions to understanding how super-continents are assembled through continental collision. With a total of over 220 deployments, the Hi-CLIMB array is the most extensive broadband seismic experiment to date. In the near future, this dataset will only be eclipsed by the completion of the USArray of EarthScope. To this end, the work is timely in anticipation of other datasets to probe the continental lithosphere. In particular, the mobile component of the USArray has the potential of investigating a full spectrum of geologic settings over the North American continent.<br/><br/>With data now available from densely spaced, broadband seismic arrays, advances that were once strictly in the domain of exploration seismology can now be incorporated into seismic imaging techniques using earthquake sources. To this end, the techniques in this project are at the leading edge of research: Indeed, only earthquake sources can satisfy two stringent requirements simultaneously: 1) The source of illumination must be strong enough to penetrate the entire lithosphere; and 2) the cost and logistics must be affordable in an academic setting.<br/><br/>The project is expected to have broad societal impacts. One natural product is the improved images of the Himalayan seismic belt -- a leading seismogenic fault system of the world where millions of people reside, including a large fraction of population in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Better imaging of seismogenic structures in the central Himalayas provides essential constraints for seismic hazard analysis in a region where geologic disasters have global repercussions. Furthermore, efforts are being made to involve multi-cultural and minority students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as the inclusion of this work into undergraduate and graduate teaching, and public outreach programs. In terms of technical advances, the project incorporates aspects of seismic imaging originally developed by the petroleum industry for exploration of energy resources. As the work progresses, increased interactions and mutual feedback are expected between industrial and academic research."

Cramer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota will employ computational/theoretical models to study mono- and polynuclear transition-metal complexes based on copper, iron, cobalt, and ruthenium, with the key focus being to characterize mechanistic details associated with their ability to catalyze reactions having special relevance to sustainability. Catalytic processes that will be assigned the highest priority for study include (i) the oxidation of otherwise unactivated C-H bonds, (ii) water oxidation to generate molecular hydrogen and oxygen, (iii) reduction of carbon dioxide. The first catalytic process provides access to high-value functionalized molecules from cheaper hydrocarbon feedstocks, the second is a reaction of key importance in the conversion of solar energy into a green chemical fuel (hydrogen), and the third offers the opportunity to convert cheap and abundant CO2 into industrially useful commodity chemicals like formaldehyde and methanol, which is of considerable interest not only from an economic perspective, but also because of the influence of increasing atmospheric CO2 levels on global climate change. Any locally developed code/software that implements new models will be made broadly available to the greater chemistry community, and ongoing incorporation of models into open source and commercial codes will further extend their availability. Outreach and mentoring activities will be accomplished through continued work with a number of University of Minnesota programs, including the College of Science & Engineering Summer Bridge Program, the Multicultural Summer Research Opportunities Program, and the North Star STEM alliance/Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program, amongst others.<br/><br/>Density functional and highly correlated single and multideterminantal wave function theories will be applied to complex chemical systems designed to catalyze reactions of interest from a sustainability standpoint. In order to treat the influence of a surrounding condensed phase on the catalytic cycle, continuum (and cluster-continuum) solvation models for use in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations (e.g., computations of standard reduction potentials and solvatochromic shifts, respectively) will be employed. Thermochemical and spectral quantities will be determined and validated against experimental data where available. High priority targets for study include water splitting focusing especially on catalysts based on earth-abundant metals, for which mechanistic details remain obscure in several systems based on copper or iron, for example. Reduction of carbon dioxide remains another challenging problem, particularly from a catalytic standpoint, and the ability of mono- and polynuclear transition-metal complexes to bind and activate CO2 to reduction will be examined in order to understand those electronic structure details (and how they are influenced by ligands) that facilitate reaction. Lastly, ""green"" oxidation reactions employing molecular oxygen as the oxidant and activating C-H bonds, for example, will be explored for systems where catalytic activity has been observed based on copper or manganese containing coordination compounds."

One important application of the comparative method in the study of biodiversity is the comparison of sister lineages, groups which are each other's closest relative, that have undergone very different evolutionary histories. By comparing the fates of these lineages, scientists are able to understand why some are successful and others are not. A prominent example is the sunflower family, the Asteraceae, and its less well-known sister family, the Calyceraceae. The Asteraceae has been one of the most successful plant families with over 20,000 species spread throughout the world, including many economically important plants, such as sunflowers, daises, lettuce, artichokes and dandelions. The evolution of the Calyceraceae on the other hand has resulted in only 56 species, all found in southern South America. Despite the large number of species, Asteraceae researchers are developing an understanding of the family?s evolutionary trajectory and traits, however little is known about the Calyceraceae. This research project will develop an understanding of what the common ancestor of these two families was like. This will allow a careful analysis of which changes allowed the Asteraceae to succeed in generating great diversity, including developing economically important traits, and which inhibited Calyceraceae diversification. This project will foster interactions among scientists, graduate, and undergraduate students in two countries, thus enhancing international collaboration and cultural awareness. <br/><br/>Field work will be undertaken in collaboration with researchers in Argentina to collect the 56 species of the Calyceraceae. This material will be used to generate a molecular phylogeny and a morphological trait matrix. Comparative DNA sequencing of both chloroplast and nuclear genes will be undertaken to infer phylogenetic relationships in the family. Additionally a morphological trait matrix, of important flower and fruit characteristics, will be generated and analyzed in conjunction with the phylogeny to study the evolution of character states in the Calyceraceae. This data on the Calyceraceae will complement the knowledge already available for the Asteraceae allowing for addressing powerful comparative biology questions. What are the phylogenetic relationships among all species of Calyceraceae? What are the ancestral floral and fruit character traits states in Calyceraceae and how do these relate to those in the Asteraceae? The final products of the research include bilingual taxonomic revision, including dichotomous and polyclave keys, which will be made available in both print and electronic versions. To increase participation by underrepresented groups, students will be recruited via Brigham Young University's Multicultural Student Center. Guest presentations and lab exercises covering state-core competencies will be developed with two area high school instructors.

Each of the annual schools will run for 9-10 days and they consist of formal lectures and hands-on experiments, using the neutron scattering facilities at the LANSCE.<br/>The main objectives of both school are: a) to provide in-depth neutron-scattering training in a particular topic (in particular, for graduate students in their early stage of thesis research), b) to attract new users to the neutron-scattering community, c) to increase diversity among expert neutron scatterers, and d) to broaden the field where neutron scattering can develop further. <br/>The number of student participants is limited to ~30 students, selected from a large applicant pool using a variety of criteria. A particular emphasis is put on selecting a diverse student body in order to foster a cross-institutional, cross-disciplinary and multicultural learning environment. This grant will support travel and meals for accepted student participants."

Their goal is to provide a multi-cultural group of students with a rigorous research experience in ecology/environmental biology during an eight-week summer period, followed by a 10 day visit to Washington, DC where they will be exposed to work being done by environmental agencies. At NMSU, groups of 3 or 4 students will collaborate in data collection on an original research project; each student will be responsible for analyzing and presenting a unique subset of the data at a mini-symposium. During meetings with their group mentor(s) students will discuss relevant literature, problems encountered, and new hypotheses and experimental designs for others to test in future years. While at NMSU, a series of visitors knowledgeable in environmental problems specific to the southwest will speak informally with the entire group. Discussions will encompass many topics of particular interest to minority groups including environmental justice and how cultural perceptions affect interpretation of environmental problems and implementation of appropriate policies. Next the entire group will visit HU where formal lectures on environmental policy, justice and related issues will be presented. The group will also tour governmental and non-governmental agencies where they will meet representatives concerned with environmental problems. This experience will not only make the students more aware of how ecological research is used to make policy decisions but will provide them with knowledge od job opportunities in environmental biology."

The accuracy of recognizing such emotional signals is an important adaptation for social life. Recently, research conducted by Dr. Hillary Anger Elfenbein at UC-Berkeley and her colleagues suggests that this accuracy is lower when reading the emotional expressions of individuals from foreign cultural groups. The current proposal seeks to understand better this cross-cultural challenge and to provide guidance for overcoming it. The PI's new ""dialect theory"" of emotion argues that different cultural groups express emotions with subtly different styles -- like different dialects of a language, such as British versus American English -- and that it is easier to understand emotions expressed in a familiar style. Because this is an area of intense current debate, the current proposal consists of a series of studies to test the specific mechanisms proposed by this new dialect theory, by examining cultural differences in the expression and judgment of spontaneous facial expressions, vocal tones, and body language. This research is timely and relevant for providing the data to judge a controversial new theory, as well as for its potential benefits to society. The findings aim to offer guidance to cope with rapid changes in the modern society, such as increasing cultural diversity. Americans work closely with people from multiple cultural backgrounds more than was previously the case. It is important to understand the nature of communication breakdowns in multicultural environments, in order to facilitate communication breakthroughs. In addition, the project broadens participation from underrepresented groups by including Native Americans in the research process."

Some European states currently are dismantling their existing multicultural policies and are adopting new policies designed to better facilitate the integration of immigrants into the host society. Researchers have analyzed the changes in immigrant integration and citizenship policies at the national scale, but work on the implementation of these policies through local integration projects in impacted neighborhoods has been missing. Also neglected has been the role of immigrants in the implementation of local integration projects. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the goals, work, and outcomes of local integration projects in Marzahn, a neighborhood in Berlin that has a high concentration of recent ethnic German migrants from the former Soviet Union. The doctoral candidate will seek answers to the following questions: (1) How do the integration goals and the underlying concepts of citizenship of local projects differ from national and provincial integration policies? (2) To what extent and how do immigrants participating in local integration projects modify project goals and outcomes? (3) How does the engagement in integration projects differ between immigrant men and women, and why? The student will use multiple methods to answer these questions. Analysis of national and provincial integration policy documents and expert interviews with local policy makers and project leaders will provide data regarding the differences between national, and provincial, and local integration objectives. Participant observation, focus groups, in-depth interviews, and immigrant diaries will provide data regarding how and why immigrants participate in integration projects and how they understand their own integration goals. The student hypothesizes that national and provincial integration objectives and their underlying conceptions of citizenship often are challenged and actively amended in the process of implementation by local institutions. In addition, she suspects that because women migrants participate in local integration activities more actively than men, they shape these projects to suit their distinct needs.<br/><br/>The results of this research will fill gaps in knowledge regarding the efficacy of local integration projects as well as on how local integration institutions and immigrants are actively involved in the transformation of integration objectives. Analysis of gender differences in project participation will provide insights into how immigrant men and women adapt to their new communities in different ways. Such insights are important for the formulation of gender-sensitive integration policies, a growing field of public policy in all major immigrant-destination countries, including the U.S. Furthermore, this study will bring scholarship on the politics of immigration integration into conversations regarding with theoretical perspectives on citizenship. Finally, by focusing on recent ethnic German immigrants from the former Soviet Union, the project it will provide insights into the specific integration challenges of migrants who have become citizens but remain culturally and socio-economically marginal. Until recently the integration needs of such naturalized migrants have received little attention and consideration in integration policy making.

The alliance contains the largest Tennessee community college, the largest Tennessee two-year technical institution, the largest tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) undergraduate institution, a private college with 47% majoring in engineering and science, the University of Tennessee In Memphis a predominantly graduate institution, three HBCUs, and the fastest growing community college in eastern Arkansas. It is an alliance of private colleges, minority colleges, community colleges, majority colleges,with African American community agencies and the secondary school system. One most probably should conclude the demographics of Tennessee (See Figure 1 on next page). Tennessee is a very long (480 miles) narrow state with the three largest cities 2000 miles apart with Memphis being the largest. Financially disadvantaged African American students cannot afford to travel several hundred miles to participate. the western section of tennessee is the Memphis section bordering West Memphis has the highest density of African American students in the Tennessee, and the neighboring counties in the tri-state area have a high concentration of African Americans. This Memphis Mid-South region has a minority population of 499,599, which is twice as large as the combination of the Nashville and the knoxville regions (13 counties each). Shelby county containing Memphis contains 371,267 year. 54% off all the youth in the city of Memphis are African Americans. 47% of the youth in the Mid-South region are African Americans while the Nashville and Knoxville regions are only 18.4% density of the African American population and youth decreases rapidly as one travel west to east as many African American youth as Nashville and 13.5 ti mes as many as the knoxville area. During the first year, 320 incoming minority freshmen and sophomore students will be prepared for completing baccalaureate degrees in SEM and eventually graduate degrees. The program consists of instruction, and personal development during the summer and mentoring and cooperative learning during the academic year followed by research and employment in science laboratories. 14,700 African American undergraduate students are already enrolled in these Mid-South Alliance colleges. The Mid-South Alliance intends to create a cadre of 800 minority students in the SEM baccalaureate programs each year. After the fifth year 160 more will be in the first year of graduate schools for a total of 960 per year. An additional 1000 African American students majoring in SEM baccalaureate programs each year. An additional 1000 African American students majoring in SEM studies will be influenced through auxiliary activities on the various campuses through seminary by visiting African American role models. The fact that we have nine active IHE's in the alliance within commuting distance allows us to work with small groups of twenty students and yet permit all the first year students to come together on minority and majority campuses for multicultural activities during our summer and academic year activities. This Alliance will provide a stimulating means for students to work their way through school with internships in science laboratories. African American role models working as mentors will meet in regularly scheduled classes for cooperative learning. Memphis Partners, one of the Alliances member, received a $3 million grant form the Dept. of Labor in July, 1994 in ""young Fair Chance"" to encourage African American into new careers, and provide African American mentors and science related internships. The Memphis school system received a $300,00 planning grant from the NSF, and opened an office of School Redesign and Training now funded by a private foundation. Their CEO is on the Advisory Committee of MAMP to improve bridging mechanisms from secondary to postsecondary institutions. Graduate schools and national laboratories will provide research experiences to Alliance students for the sophomores and juniors. The MAMP views laboratory research by the participants as extremely important to inspire students to continue for graduate SEM degrees. The pool of minority students will be increased through recruitment to SEM college degree programs from other disciplines, two-year colleges, and secondary schools. Mentors will assist and encourage all Alliance scholars to apply to SEM graduate schools."

On the Tibetan Plateau, extreme spring snowstorms are reportedly becoming more frequent and severe. The snowstorms of 1998, in which millions of livestock perished, were particularly devastating. For the first time, the Chinese government called for emergency food relief for the herders, and implemented an immediate livestock restocking effort. The overall goal of this project is to investigate the social and ecological implications of both the snowstorms and the state restocking programs, and more broadly, pastoralists' changing vulnerability to climate change. The interdisciplinary research team will draw on both climate impact analyses and vulnerability assessments to investigate how socio-economic status, ecological range condition, and state restocking programs affect herder well-being and vulnerability to severe spring snowstorms. This will be based on pre-1998 storm, immediate post-1998 storm, and contemporary data. Study methods will include interviews, participant observation, ecological field experiments, remote sensing, and climate analyses. Based on these findings, investigators will parameterize and run a coupled agent-based and ecosystem model to assess herder well-being and vulnerability to extreme storms under a suite of snowstorm frequency/intensities, management styles, and state policies. The researchers hypothesize that socioeconomic differentiation, links to regional markets, and grassland management strategies will be the main factors associated with vulnerability to snowstorms. They further hypothesize that the ecological and socio-economic changes which result from restocking will negatively affect herder well-being in the longer-term; however, herders from wetter versus drier Tibetan grassland regions will experience differing vulnerabilities. Results from this project will elucidate what ecological and socio-political features enhance or reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events under environmental and political change. Research results will also highlight important interactions and feedbacks between the coupled human-environment system under global change. <br/><br/>This project involves an international, multi-cultural, multi-lingual team of American, Chinese, and Tibetan assistants, graduate students, and both junior and senior researchers. It brings together experts in the fields of ecology, computer science, animal science, remote sensing, anthropology, geography, and political ecology. By conducting both detailed, ethnographic work and rigorous ecological experiments, at a level of detail not usually found in integrated human-ecological studies, and using both as inputs to integrative modeling, this project employs a comprehensive approach to understanding the dynamics of human and social dynamics under global change. This project provides academic training for U.S., Chinese, and Tibetan students. Based on their experiences conducting this project, the lead researchers will teach a course entitled 'Interdisciplinary Research in the Environmental Sciences' at Colorado State University, to educate and inform students about how to successfully conduct interdisciplinary research. Given the immediate policy relevance of this project, the researchers will communicate project findings to policy makers and development personnel working in China through two project stakeholder workshops. Results from this research will enhance understanding of vulnerability and livelihood of marginalized populations to political-economic and climatic change."

It does this by examining doctoral training practices critical to the transmission of skills acquired through close interaction and hands-on experience, also known as 'tacit skills.' Although an under researched area in scientific training, 'tacit skills' play a crucial role in the creativity and innovation in experimental and mathematical sciences, laser and nuclear technology development. While there is a standard set of accepted scientific principles shared by most scientists, there are also differences in terms of what is learned and how it is taught. This project focuses on Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Each of these countries has consistently exhibited high rates of innovation and productivity in recent years. However, while these countries have been successful in science education, each of them approaches the task of training scientists in various methods. The core hypothesis of the study is that student-mentor relationships significantly configure levels of scientific creativity, pioneering discoveries, technical innovation, and research productivity. The project?s main goal is to develop an empirically tested and contemporary model of science that will inform science and innovation policy about the role of 'tacit skills' in knowledge production, and to enhance best practices in U.S. graduate science training. The project analyzes the different methods using analytical, conceptual, and methodological tools from the areas of knowledge sharing, social networks, and the extended translation model of science. While a component of the project will uncover the degree of codified knowledge that is taught by most standard text books and the mastery of this knowledge, the project also seeks to understand advanced knowledge acquisition and transmission through the study of graduate science training by exploring students? relationships with mentors and peers. Contemporary research has shown that the nature of informal educational practices is not only conducive to the acquisition of 'tacit skills' but enhances professional competencies. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: This project not only advances understanding of how 'tacit skills' are transmitted, but also informs pedagogical programs, and generates 'best practices' in advanced scientific training that recognize the changing nature and morphology of knowledge production brought about by globalization. It enhances scientific manpower and infrastructure by establishing networks of collaborations across disciplinary boundaries among scientific institutions globally. This project involves the active participation of students from underrepresented Hispanic populations located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This participation exposes and socializes these students to actual multicultural research work and to professional scientific careers critical to socioeconomic development of the U.S. southern border."

Synechococcus are aquatic/marine cyanobacteria that substantially contribute to global primary productivity. This project will employ two main approaches to study Synechococcus defenses against protist predators. Experiments will examine the mechanism(s) by which cell surface proteins provide a constitutive (continuously expressed) defense and assay the generality of this defense among Synechococcus strains and against diverse predator types. Secondly, co-culture techniques, in which Synechococcus are grown in the presence of predators, will be used to characterize protein-based induced defenses that may arise in response to predation. The formation of aggregates as a possible induced defense by Synechococcus will also be examined in field and laboratory settings. Aggregate formation is important for the biogeochemistry and ecological functioning of planktonic communities since aggregates can be the site of unique biogeochemical processes. The research is cross-cutting on a number of levels: it examines constitutive and induced defenses in both controlled laboratory and natural settings; it leverages the suite of available Synechococcus genomes to enable a mechanistic investigation of microbial defense processes; and it represents a synthesis of ecological and genomic approaches to the study of microbial interactions that are fundamental to biogeochemical cycling and the maintenance of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this project include support of graduate and undergraduate students, including ethnic minority participants in Shannon Point Marine Center's Multicultural Initiatives in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP).

However, this research does not adequately address how OA effects to individuals are linked across trophic levels. Pelagic copepods are critical players in most marine biogeochemical cycles. Their consumption of phytoplankton and microzooplankton is the primary mechanism by which bacterial and phytoplankton production is transferred to higher trophic levels. Despite their high abundance and ecological importance, copepods have received little research attention concerning OA. The few studies focused on direct acute effects to copepods (e.g. egg hatching, survival) under elevated pCO2, and few significant effects have been observed at predicted future pCO2. However, there is increasing recognition that OA significantly affects their phytoplankton prey, including elevating growth rates, increasing cell sizes, altering nutrient uptake and ratios, and chemical composition. Because copepod grazing, egg production, and hatching success all can vary with these prey characteristics, OA mediated changes in phytoplankton quality may be an important indirect mechanism through which OA acts on copepod populations and, ultimately, marine food webs. <br/><br/>This study that will advance our understanding of how copepod populations may be affected by OA, specifically through OA induced changes in phytoplankton quality. The core objective of this study is to determine how changes in phytoplankton physiology and biochemistry (e.g. lipid composition) affect copepod egg production, hatching, and ontogenetic development of nauplii. The PIs will include a subset of experiments to test whether OA affects copepod reproductive output independent of changes to prey. To achieve these research goals, the diatom, Ditylum brightwellii, and dinoflagellate, Prorocentrum micans, will be cultured semi-continuously under several pCO2 concentrations, during which time the investigators will characterize changes in their physiology and biochemistry. The copepods, Calanus pacificus, a large, high lipid-bearing marine species, and Acartia clausi, a smaller, low lipid-bearing estuarine species, will be maintained across varying pCO2 concentrations and fed these pCO2-acclimated prey, and their grazing and reproductive capability quantified. The copepods and phytoplankton used in this study will be collected from the Salish Sea, a region already experiencing periods of high pCO2/H+ (>1000 ppm, pH 7.5) on varying timescales. Therefore, this research addresses a question of how future climate change may impact marine ecosystems, but also is relevant to pCO2/H+ variability presently experienced in coastal environments. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The PIs of this project are committed to: 1) promoting access to under-represented groups, 2) training and mentoring, 3) broadening knowledge of OA and 4) developing infrastructure for ongoing, multidisciplinary OA research. Under-represented groups will be served through Shannon Point Marine Center's (SPMC) nationally recognized NSF-funded Multicultural Initiative in the Marine Sciences: Undergraduate Participation (MIMSUP: http://www.wwu.edu/mimsup/), and University of Washington's Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PNW LSAMP) programs. Educational goals are addressed through an array of activities including K-12 outreach, research experiences for undergraduates, including SPMC's summer REU program, and development of widely disseminated curricular materials. The project will support and participate in SPMC?s public outreach initiative, increasing awareness of marine issues in the general public. This study will support three early career scientists, a public education outreach specialist, and will train a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student. Infrastructure improvements to SPMC's existing OA research facility will increase usability, making it more accessible for classroom use and student research. The additional instrumentation will also allow the facility to become a regional resource for monitoring pCO2 in the Salish Sea."

Her particular focus will be on how multiple actors involved in chronic condition care develop and negotiate their understandings of disease. <br/><br/>The research will be conducted in Chicago, Illinois, with American Indian diabetics, informal caregivers, and biomedical providers. American Indians have some of the highest rates of diabetes worldwide. While more than sixty percent of American Indians live in urban areas, the majority of studies on the American Indian diabetes epidemic are centered on reservations. Research methods will include a combination of participant observation, participant shadowing, semi-structured interviews, and the collection and analysis of diabetes-related literature utilized by research participants. The project seeks to meet three overarching research objectives: (1) document the factors that shape patient and provider concepts of diabetes, (2) trace the movement of these concepts in order to understand the extent to which patient knowledge is shaped by biomedical models, as well as the extent to which patient knowledge influences biomedical models, and (3) investigate what role these diabetes concepts play in the constitution of an urban American Indian community. <br/><br/>The research has both policy and theory-building importance. It will extend scholarship in anthropology and science and technology studies by investigating how disease concepts are formed through social interactions as well as through biomedical evidence. Findings from this research also will offer insight to public health workers developing diabetes prevention and care programs to be implemented in urban and multicultural healthcare settings. In addition, the research will contribute to anthropological studies of urban American Indian life by investigating what role diabetes and concepts of the condition disseminated by local health and social institutions play in integrating individuals from varied tribal and personal backgrounds. Supporting this research also supports the education of a graduate student."

Work at the AMO is focused on identifying never-before cultured microbes and discovering ways to grow them in the laboratory so that they can be studied using modern physiological and genomic methods. Such studies will help the researchers at the AMO discover new forms of life and to understand how they perform important biological functions (e.g. nutrient cycling and gas production) under extremely cold conditions. In addition, an interactive, Internet database will be further developed to explore the evolutionary relationships, distribution and functioning of novel microbes in alpine environments. <br/><br/>This project will help researchers to understand how colder regions of the earth function as part of the biosphere and how they will respond to future climate change. Such work can only be accomplished via interdisciplinary research, involving researchers with expertise in microbiology, biogeochemistry, evolutionary biology, and bioinformatics. In addition, the research could lead to the discovery of useful products such as antibiotics and industrial enzymes that function at cold temperatures. The development of a web-based public access system expands the educational and out-reach value of the research and will allow scientists and the public to use the knowledge generated at the AMO. This research also will promote training through its support of two undergraduate students, two graduate students and two post-doctoral fellows. PI Schmidt will participate in the Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training program at CU Boulder and co-PI Martin will work with the Boulder School District mentoring program to provide AMO research projects for secondary school students."

Detection and warning systems such as the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoys detect and report tsunamis, but their utility is greatest for distant tsunamis and at best limited for local tsunamis. Perceptional events such as ground shaking and sea-level changes have served as effective warning signals in historic tsunamis and may provide the first and only alert of local tsunamis (Gonzalez 1999, Dudley 1998, Darienzo in press). Communities thus must be aware of natural signs of tsunamis and possess a capacity to respond to two very different forms of warning (official and natural). No good or systematic data exists for response to natural warning signs, although scant observations of behavior in Papua New Guinea, Japan, and Hawai'i illustrate its complexity. Historic tsunamis illustrate that natural signs can serve as effective warning signals but also show many people intentionally enter tsunami danger zones. <br/><br/>This research team will collect short-lived social data from people in affected areas of the Andaman coast, Thailand to understand human behavioral response to the events of December 26, 2004. Data will be obtained with interview questionnaires, modified from similar studies (Gregg et al., 2005, Lachman et al., 1961) to reflect the local culture and language. The research will investigate 1) people's awareness of, and response to, the natural warning signs of the tsunami, as well as warning provided by other people or observations of other people's actions, 2) the factors that determined which responses the respondent chose, 3) the factors that respondents retrospectively believe would have influenced them to act differently and 4) pre- and post-impact preparedness for tsunamis using model measures in Paton (2003). The team will also collect data from visitors who were in the disaster area but who have since repatriated. The researchers involved consist of a multidisciplinary and multicultural research team of physical scientists, psychologists, and graduate students, from Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and the US.<br/><br/>This exploratory research is critical to help build community resilience in coastal communities because even the raw data can be used to frame models of human behavior in all communities at risk. The study will be widely disseminated through scientific publications and the Web and be used to frame effective outreach education programs that are essential to prepare communities to respond to the unique demands of warning messages for both distant and local tsunamis. <br/><br/>This research is supported jointly by the Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) priority area, the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), and the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Program."

Methods for their structural characterization need further development. This research is focused on the structure determination of modulated crystals of profilin:actin. The objectives of this research are two-fold; first, to continue to develop new macromolecular X-ray crystallographic methods for the structure solution of aperiodic, modulated crystals, and second, to test the hypothetical model that the actin ''ribbon'' found in PA crystals represents a structural intermediate of filamentous actin. This research will employ protein crystal growth, X-ray diffraction data collection and structure determination. At several points during the project, innovative approaches to protein crystallography and software will be developed. The unique diffraction pattern from the modulated crystals contains unusual off-lattice satellite reflections next to the main reflections. Strategies for collecting X-ray diffraction data that detect and separate satellite reflections from the main reflections will be developed. Downstream of data collection, existing software from chemical (AKA small molecule) crystallography will be adapted and used to process the modulated diffraction pattern. From the diffraction data, the type and direction of the modulation(s) will be determined. Then additional chemical crystallography software will be extensively modified and combined with macromolecular algorithms to solve the modulated crystallographic phase problem, produce multidimensional electron density images and refine the modulated atomic structure against the experimental diffraction data. Finally, the resulting structure(s) will be analyzed within the framework of the current cell biology literature. It is anticipated that these structural results will test the validity of the ribbon-to-helix model of actin filament formation. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Research will be integrated with education through partnership with the University of Nebraska-Omaha to develop undergraduate research internships and coursework in protein purification and crystallization with profilin:actin as a central theme; the formation of ''Graduate Student Training Program in Structural Biology and Biophysics'' at UNMC; supporting national conference workshops on how to solve modulated structures for the continued education of chemical and macromolecular crystallographers at all levels; and the incorporation of research results and methods into graduate-level coursework.

This focus is manifested in the number of undergraduates conducting research projects (over 100 per year) and the number of established faculty having extramurally-funded research programs (66%). In the summer of 2001 a pilot summer research program was enormously successful in supporting the continuation of research conducted during the academic year and achieving the educational goals of the department. Funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) will enable JMU to expand this pilot program to include students outside the boundaries of JMU and to enhance the research pedagogy within the department.<br/>The new NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program will provide an exciting 10-week summer research experience at the JMU campus. The experience will begin with a research workshop aimed at ensuring that all students have the fundamental tools necessary to conduct their research program. Mini-lectures and discussion sessions will be interspersed with experiential activities throughout the day and each day will end with a summary session where fundamental concepts will be reinforced. Topics covered will include ""thinking outside the box"", quantitative methods, data interpretation, technical writing, bioethics, multimedia strategies, and an introduction to basic laboratory instrumentation. The remaining 9 weeks of the experience will be largely devoted to research along with seminars, student research talks and faculty-originated case study scenarios. It is anticipated that the research project conducted in the summer will continue into the academic year, either in a JMU laboratory or through a collaborative arrangement with the student's home institution. It is also expected that the results of these projects will be disseminated via presentations in regional/national meetings and peer-reviewed journals.<br/>Recruitment will focus on four primary groups of constituents within our geographical region, 1) non-JMU students at institutions that do not support robust summer research programs, 2) students from minority-serving institutions, 3) community college students, and 4) JMU students. We have already built liaisons with these college/universities through our recently funded ""Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology"" (UMEB) program. Recruitment will be accomplished using mailings, e-mails, personal contacts, personal visits, and the resources of the Office of Multicultural Activities at JMU. Applications will be assessed on the basis of the student's academic achievements/potential, minimum course requirements, potential for continuation of the summer research project, and ability to support the diversity of the program.

K-12 teachers are also aware of the need for scientific study of language, particularly in order to meet the goals articulated in current state accountability requirements that demand that students demonstrate high-level literacy, writing, and speaking skills. Teachers need a broad understanding about the structure of language and its use to help their students understand how language works so that they can use it well for reading, writing, and speaking in the increasingly multicultural and multilingual classroom. In spite of the joint commitment of linguists and teachers to the importance of the study of language in the K-12 curriculum, research in educational linguistics has had only a minimal impact on public school teaching. Key to integrating linguistic science into the schools is improving teacher preparation and training. Though some teacher education programs offer courses in linguistics, linguists who teach such courses know little about K-12 teaching. Improving teacher education thus depends on improving teacher education faculty expertise: linguists who teach education courses must understand which areas of linguistics are of most importance to K-12 teachers, but also how that material can be taught most effectively in the K-12 classroom. <br/><br/>The principal investigators (both of whom are linguists who teach teacher education courses) are partnering with active K-12 teachers to identify language issues of most importance to teachers, and to determine how linguistic science can be most effectively integrated into current K-12 curriculum to meet teacher goals. This work is also identifying ways to expand linguistic knowledge beyond the borders of current pedagogy and is designing effective ways to implement expanded linguistic knowledge into the K-12 classroom through activities, exercises, and other methods (with input from active teachers). <br/><br/>This project is also designing approaches to undergraduate teacher education that are informed by its earlier fieldwork. Additional materials are being designed, including topics for discussion, activities, exercises, and guided reading for students, as well as K-12 teaching activities and mini-lessons.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The project addresses a persistent problem in pre-service teacher education, namely the need for teachers to have a scientific understanding of language that they can apply more productively in their classrooms.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The series of course modules for undergraduate teacher education that are being developed are being broadly distributed through national professional organizations that support the project (The National Council of Teachers of English, The Linguistic Society of America, and The Center for Applied Linguistics). There is the potential for a major impact on K-12 students who are benefiting from improved teaching about language in a number of ways: a better understanding of language structure, change, variation, use, and diversity; and a deepening of their critical thinking skills for high achievement in writing, reading, science, math and other content areas. Other impacts include improved performance on state assessments and more success in meeting state level education accountability requirements."

This will make possible research emphasizing the relationship between nutrient cycling and both plant-soil and community interactions in ecosystems. Dr. Martha Phillips will use the equipment for research focused on invasive species and long-term plant community dynamics in wetland ecosystems. Observed spatial and temporal patterns in invasion by Phalaris arundinacea (an invasive grass in wetlands) suggest that nutrient availability plays a large role in invasion risk. The equipment will be used to assess links between nutrient status and community invasion, as well as nutrients as driving competitive interactions between invasive and native species. Understanding the linkages between nutrient availability and invasive species will allow for better control of invasive species, thereby preserving biodiversity and natural ecosystem functioning, and preventing economic damage. The work of Dr. Jill Welter focuses on the integration of food web structure and nutrient cycling in river networks, providing quantitative linkages between communities of organisms and C, N, and P cycling. The quantification of these nutrient pools will further our understanding of the influence of the availability and resource stoichiometry of potentially limiting nutrients and food web structure on nutrient transformation and release to downstream ecosystems. This work emphasizes biotic interactions that may influence rates of nitrogen fixation, differentially affecting N and P transport. This is especially important in understanding how changes in N and P supply, so often a result of human inputs, influence nutrient uptake and retention and are transmitted downstream. The instrumentation will strongly enhance the intellectual scope of faculty-student research in community and ecosystem science and will be integrated into research-based undergraduate curricula in biology and chemistry. At the baccalaureate level, St. Catherine University is a liberal arts institution for women where many students (~25%) identify as multicultural and 27% are first generation college students; thus the equipment will help us to prepare women and students of color to succeed in graduate school and scientific careers."

Drawing upon recent developments in organization theory, especially work at the Santa Fe institute on self-organizing, non-hierarchical systems as organizational forms that have the requisite flexibility for continuing adaptability in rapidly changing environments, the researchers propose to study the coevolution of organizational forms and interactive technologies by focusing on NGOs in four East Central European Societies, gathering data from 100 NGOs in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Data collection will include field surveys augmented by in-depth, ethnographic studies of 20 of these organizations to provide more nuanced accounts of the lines of causation among critical variables in the study.<br/>NGOs are particularly appropriate for study because they are increasingly being pushed to move beyond their existing roles to facilitate economic and social dynamism, assisting their societies in developing sources of innovation and the capacity to generate it. Such capacity depends on both a rich associational life (badly atrophied under communism) and a requisite variety of organizational forms (which did not exist under communism). Information technology can play an important role in facilitating both aspects of generative capability.<br/>By examining variation across types of organizations among countries in the region, the researchers will chart how innovation in the adoption and use of interactive technologies is shaped by organizational form and, in turn, how new technologies facilitate organizational innovation. This study's robust and contemporary theoretical grounding and its multidisciplinary, multicultural setting promise especially interesting insights, especially as so much of prior organizational theory has been colored by a North American bias and the assumption of universality in findings."

Recent projections of future global climate changes (GCC) have given rise to grave concerns about the future of the world's coral reefs, as the thermal consequences of GCC have been predicted to intensify in the next 30-50 years. To date, our ability to gauge the vulnerability of coral reefs to global warming has been limited by our lack of knowledge about the capacity for coral symbioses to acclimatize and/or adapt to thermal stress over ecological time frames. In order to be able to predict and model how corals will respond to increasing ocean temperature anomalies, we need to begin understanding the potential mechanisms of thermal tolerance in scleractinian coral symbioses. This project will identify the genetic response of coral species to global environmental changes by looking at the molecular mechanisms behind thermal tolerance and by identifying the genetic traits under global-change-induced selection. This area of research is crucial to a complete understanding of the potential of tropical corals to survive and adapt to the rapid global climate changes that our planet is facing. <br/><br/>The use of gene expression profiling approaches, under simulated and controlled experimental settings, will allow the investigators to identify the molecular level effects that account for thermal tolerance ranges, and type of changes in gene expression is needed to achieve thermal acclimatization. This project will also use the identified candidate genes involved in the acclimatization process of thermal tolerance as genetic markers to monitor whether seawater temperature changes influence coral species at the level of DNA sequences. The nature of selection imposed by environmental changes and the potential of coral populations to respond to global climate change by evolutionary rapid adaptation will be assessed.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Coral reef ecosystems provide for the livelihood of millions of people through the tropics but their future is uncertain as we still do not fully understand the capacity of corals to respond to the new global climate changes - thus the results of this project is relevant to society. The information to be generated in this project is vital for managing the current and future coral reefs in our planet, and the findings will be disseminated both through peer reviewed publications and through presentations at national and international scientific meetings. This project represents a collaborative effort between U.S. and Australian scientists with experience in the field of molecular biology and ecology of coral and Symbiodinium symbioses. In addition, the data and methodologies generated will be transferred to both national and international students during training workshops organized in collaboration with Australian scientists through the Global Coral Reef Targeted Research & Capacity Building Project, funded by the Global Environmental Fund from the World Bank. Moreover, this project will have an immediate and significant impact by training one or two graduate and several undergraduate students in a multicultural environment that includes minorities, national and foreign students. This setting will provide young scientists a chance to participate in the development of experiments that range from molecular ecology to physiology, including both lab and marine field experiments/procedures.<br/>Rodriguez-Lanetty has recently started a new position and new laboratory in the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and part of his planned initiative is also to establish a relationship between his laboratory and the local community including teachers and students of several minority serving institutions in the region. The research in this project will be showcased in both interactions with the Louisiana schools and in guest lectures presented to community colleges and undergraduates at UL Lafayette. The effort of this initiative is aimed at transferring the details of our work to a diverse set of audiences which will promote awareness of the issues facing coral reefs worldwide."

Some things can be eaten, others can be sat upon, still others afford walking upon, past, or through, or even talking to. Apparently only humans give names to these noticeable similarities. One might think that the things named are those most important to human thought. Yet languages differ from one to the other in this respect, they do not carve up the world in the same way. In English we call some colors blue and other colors purple, but other languages have a single name to cover both. The extents to which languages are alike or different tell us much about human thought and how people come to understand their language. <br/>With NSF support, Dr. Barbara Malt and Dr. Phillip Wolff will bring together psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists to share data about these similarities and differences across languages. These scientists will explore how words capture human experience and discuss together the implications for understanding thought and language. The broader impacts of this workshop include the inherent multi-cultural and multi-linguistic dimensions of the problem. The participants come from different disciplines and diverse parts of the world. Consequently the workshop will foster new international and inter-disciplinary collaborations, highlight the importance of cross-linguistic and cross-cultural research, and recruit graduate students from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. The knowledge gained will improve understanding of how people from different cultures talk and think. Practical spin-offs of this work include improved understanding of obstacles in the path of second language learning, automated translation software, and natural language interfaces for computers."

By studying arrays of neoglycopeptides synthesized by a recently developed combinatorial method, Professor Carrasco hopes to discover general structural motifs that confer proteolytic resistance. These motifs will then be tested on peptide and protein models of practical and theoretical interest. The stages of research will be: (1) synthesizing a combinatorial array of neoglycopeptides, (2) determining the proteolysis of the members of the neoglycopeptide array by a variety of proteases, (3) analyzing the results to determine general, protective structural motifs, and (4) introducing these motifs to bioactive peptides and proteins to increase their proteolytic resistance without disturbing their function. The results generated will provide new strategies for the design of novel peptide and protein pharmaceuticals.<br/><br/>The teaching portion of this proposal focuses on extending the culture of research and community of scholars present in the sciences to include underrepresented students with a special emphasis on Latino students. Four concrete objectives will be implemented to foster a network of students and faculty across the scientific disciplines that will address both general scientific issues and ancillary issues specific to those from multicultural backgrounds. The four objectives are: (1) identifying and recruiting research students from underrepresented groups, (2) creating a faculty and peer mentoring network, (3) establishing a specific program of research presentations and attendance at regional and national meetings, and (4) initiating a regular, special seminar series given by prominent scientists from underrepresented groups. The main emphasis of the program is providing both scientific and personal mentoring for the students. Therefore, with the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for this CAREER award, Professor Michael Carrasco, of the Department of Chemistry at the Santa Clara University seeks to determine if glycosylation can be an effective tool in developing more proteolytic-resistant peptide and protein pharmaceutical as part of his research effort and will use teaching and mentoring underrepresented students as part of his educational goals."

It does this by examining doctoral training practices critical to the transmission of skills acquired through close interaction and hands-on experience, also known as 'tacit skills.' Although an under researched area in scientific training, 'tacit skills' play a crucial role in the creativity and innovation in experimental and mathematical sciences, laser and nuclear technology development. While there is a standard set of accepted scientific principles shared by most scientists, there are also differences in terms of what is learned and how it is taught. <br/><br/>This project focuses on Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Each of these countries has consistently exhibited high rates of innovation and productivity in recent years. However, while these countries have been successful in science education, each of them approaches the task of training scientists in various methods. The core hypothesis of the study is that student-mentor relationships significantly configure levels of scientific creativity, pioneering discoveries, technical innovation, and research productivity. The project's main goal is to develop an empirically tested and contemporary model of science that will inform science and innovation policy about the role of 'tacit skills' in knowledge production, and to enhance best practices in U.S. graduate science training. <br/><br/>The project analyzes the different methods using analytical, conceptual, and methodological tools from the areas of knowledge sharing, social networks, and the extended translation model of science. While a component of the project will uncover the degree of codified knowledge that is taught by most standard text books and the mastery of this knowledge, the project also seeks to understand advanced knowledge acquisition and transmission through the study of graduate science training by exploring students' relationships with mentors and peers. Contemporary research has shown that the nature of informal educational practices is not only conducive to the acquisition of 'tacit skills' but enhances professional competencies. <br/><br/>This Project not only advances understanding of how 'tacit skills' are transmitted, but also informs pedagogical programs, and generates 'best practices' in advanced scientific training that recognize the changing nature and morphology of knowledge production brought about by globalization. It enhances scientific manpower and infrastructure by establishing networks of collaborations across disciplinary boundaries among scientific institutions globally. This Project involves the active participation of students from underrepresented Hispanic populations located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This participation exposes and socializes these students to actual multicultural research work and to professional scientific careers critical to socioeconomic development of the U.S. southern border."

Molecular studies of species within several selected genera will be conducted to understand evolutionary relationships. Comparative analyses of the evolutionary relationships and biogeographical histories of the groups studied will allow for the testing of climate- and weather-based hypotheses of wind dispersal of spores to the Hawaiian Islands. Such comparisons will allow for an assessment of the possibility that long-distance wind dispersal to the archipelago has been essentially random across groups or if there are common patterns across groups due to the existence of common dispersal routes. The proposed research will make a significant contribution to our understanding of the historical biogeography of an evolutionarily and ecologically important and under-studied group of plants in the Hawaiian Islands and around the Pacific region. Because<br/>the ancestors of many native Hawaiian plants, fungi, and insects undoubtedly arrived via long-distance wind dispersal to the islands, this research will provide new insights into the origin and diversification of native groups of organisms in the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, hypotheses about evolutionary relationships will be generated for several groups of Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian ferns that will provide a basis for and lead to future, more detailed evolutionary studies. <br/>The proposed research will have a significant impact on the development of human resources by providing training and first-hand experience in evolutionary<br/>biology, systematics, biogeography, tropical biology, molecular techniques, and data analysis to graduate students at CU-Boulder and four or more undergraduate students per year at Carroll College and CU-Boulder. Several programs exist at the University of Colorado to encourage undergraduate students to become involved with research projects. PI Ranker regularly works with and mentors such students, including participants in the Summer Multicultural Access to Research and Training program. PI Ranker will recruit two or more students per year through these programs to assist with the proposed research, both in the field and in the laboratory, as honor's and independent<br/>research students. Similarly, PI Geiger will recruit two or more students per year to assist with the proposed research at Carroll College, which is an undergraduate institution.

Knowledge and Ethics in the Debate Over Inuit Suicide (Knowledge and Ethics) is a long-term (12 month), multi-sited (Iqaluit, Pangnirtung, Toronto) ethnographic research project that seeks to understand how knowledge about suicide is produced in a multi-cultural and post-colonial milieu. Through semi-structured interviews, conversation, archival research, and a youth video project, Knowledge and Ethics proposes to study the social and political implications of western medical, scientific and journalistic knowledge on the subject of Inuit suicide.<br/><br/>In addition, Knowledge and Ethics identifies and analyzes the dialog between Inuit ways of knowing and western biomedical knowledge. The divergent responses of psychiatrists, family members and suicidal individuals to research questions concerning human life, the preservation of life (ethics), and the self should provide data about different conceptions of reality and how meaning is created. Through careful discourse analysis the investigators hope to identify new ways of conceptualizing human life that are emerging in the Canadian arctic. Through such analyses, this research proposes to enhance and challenge theoretical discussions on the cultural construction of knowledge, indigenous identity, and the meanings of suicide, as well as, contribute to the ongoing debate about the creation of knowledge amidst upheaval and cultural confrontation."

The materials take a system science approach to snow in the environment and include a multicultural perspective that includes Inupiaq vocabulary for the phenomenon described in the books. The focus is on the students and teachers that will be visited during the traverse, to share knowledge and passion for science through understanding snow, a prevalent feature in the Arctic, and to teach essential concepts of physics and chemistry using snow. In addition the investigators will develop the indoor and outdoor activities into a workbook for classrooms. A website will be updated throughout the traverse and will include educational materials relevant for use by schools not visited by the traverse and as a resource following the traverse. The researchers will also revisit sites from a 1924 survey by the U.S. Geological Survey and sites studied over the previous 10 years by the research team to reconstruct old photographs, collect samples and make observations. Snow samples will be analyzed for soot and mercury by collaborating researchers. A National Park Service biologist will join the team on the traverse to further develop an activity using animal tracks in the snow as a way of estimating animal populations.

Currently, 60% of Berkeley students demonstrate some type of financial need and are receiving need-based support in order to attend college. Financial need is perhaps a more serious impediment to timely completion of engineering degrees--the technical course load is often not compatible with long hours of outside work. Cal-CSEMS scholars participate in a variety of retention-related activities tied to the existing student support infrastructure of CUES, the EECS Center for Undergraduate Matters, and other partner programs. This includes faculty advising, academic excellence workshops, tutoring, mentoring, internships in industry and/or research experience, and assistance with graduate school applications or job placement. A unifying theme of the ""CSEMS at Cal"" program is to increase student retention by helping each student develop into a committed member of the engineering and academic community."

Categorical variables that summarize this type of survey data are called multiple response (or pick any/c) categorical variables. It is often of interest to test for independence between two categorical variables. When categorical variables can have multiple responses, traditional Pearson chi-square tests for independence should not be used because of the within-subject dependence among responses. This research will provide methods to test for independence between two or more multiple-response categorical variables. A modified version of the Pearson statistic will perform the test, and bootstrap procedures will provide approximate sampling distributions. First and second-order corrections will allow for chi-square distribution approximations to the sampling distribution. Generalized log linear models and multivariate binomial logit-normal models will provide a model-based approach for the test of independence. <br/><br/>Many survey questions are asked in a multiple-response manner. Examples include: ""What types of cars do you own?"" and ""For what criminal offenses have you been arrested?"" Other questions naturally fall into a multiple-response format, but some researchers avoid asking them in this format due to statistical analysis problems. For example, most survey questions dealing with ethnicity allow respondents to make only one choice, which is entirely inappropriate in today's highly multicultural population. Other researchers may analyze multiple-response questions as if they came from single-response categorical variables, which can lead to very conservative tests of independence. This research will allow researchers to incorporate these types of questions into surveys and use statistically correct methods of analysis. The research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies under the Research on Survey and Statistical Methodology Funding Opportunity."

Yet we know very little about the social and cultural specificities of knowledge production and practices of science in India. We know very little about the pedagogy, cultural substrate, and training of Indian scientists who currently occupy significant positions (both in numbers and in rank) in the increasingly multicultural, transnational, and global scientific enterprise. Today, India is in the throes of increasing religious nationalism on the one hand and accelerated technological development on the other. In this milieu science, religion and nationalism have fused together in the popular imagination. Assertions of the sanctity of science and technology as well as the scientific validation of religion by the Hindu nationalists, as manifested in the euphoria surrounding the ""Hindu Bomb,"" point to the need for understanding the processes of co-production of science, nationalism and religion. Science has always been a site of political and social contestation. In the earlier Nehru era as well, industrial development, and scientific rationality had defined the terms of India's modernity but in distinctly secular idioms. How do we understand the historical evolution of scientific structures and practices in modern India? In order to address these issues, we would like to organize a conference of scholars working on science-studies in India during the Spring semester of 2003 at MIT. The conference will bring twelve junior and senior scholars from a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary backgrounds. The participants will share their work as well as discuss how best to further the emerging field of science studies in India. The papers will be collected in an edited anthology. Our objective is to probe deeper into the different perspectives of the scholars on nationalism, on local, religious and caste identities, and on the nature of science, for instance, in order to understand the ways in which different frameworks engender some questions and foreclose others. Such an engagement is essential for consolidating the intellectual base of the scholarship and for creating a vibrant and interactive community of scholars working on science in India."

In addition, relatively little is known about the detailed mechanisms whereby multimeric proteins acquire their higher order structure, even though oligomeric proteins play important roles in a number of cellular processes. PHS could serve as a model system for the study of the role of protein structure, function and oligomer assembly. Structural studies on SmbP should provide important insights into the role of metal ions in protein stability and advance the field of protein folding and metalloprotein design.<br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this research provides an excellent opportunity to train graduate and advanced undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary and multicultural research environment.

In recent years, layered materials engineered at the nanoscale have exhibited exciting possibilities for producing extremely high strength, fatigue resistance, thermal resistance, wear resistance, and biocompatibility. The research plan consists of following major thrusts: (i) processing by physical vapor deposition (PVD) and microstructure characterization (SEM, TEM, and HRTEM) of multilayered Al/SiC composites (Arizona State); (ii) residual stress characterization by x-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction (Oak Ridge National Laboratory); (iii) deformation behavior by nanoindentation and microforce tensile and fatigue testing (Arizona State); and (iv) simulation of deformation behavior by continuum, dislocation dynamics, and atomistic methodologies. The relationship between processing, nanoscale structure and mechanical properties of metal/ceramic nanolayers is examined by way of experiments employing deposition, characterization and small-scale mechanical testing techniques. Computational simulations across multiple length scales provide fundamental insights into the deformation and fracture mechanisms of nanolayered composites. NONTECHNICAL: Enhancing materials education and public awareness of the importance of nanolayered materials research and its role in addressing societal needs forms a crucial component of the program. A diverse educational and outreach program is integrated with the research program and serves to disseminate, educate, and involve students at all levels as well as the public. The program enhances the university partnership between ASU and UNM. The outreach program has the following components: (i) Creation of a new course on mechanics of nanomaterials offered jointly at ASU and UNM; (ii) Project-based activities and research opportunities for undergraduate students at ASU, UNM, and ORNL; (iii) Recruitment and involvement of underrepresented females and minorities through outreach programs at both ASU and UNM; (iv) virtual thesis defenses for graduate students and the creation of a virtual seminar series; and (v) public awareness by the creation of a website on nanomaterials.

Grounded in the history of technology, this project focuses on one prong of the post-WWII missionary broadcasting effort: the project to distribute inexpensive radio receivers around the world. Employing extensive new archival sources in the private collections, the project develops case studies of two of the largest missionary receiver distribution programs, as well as the evangelical project to develop a missionary transistor receiver. It demonstrates empirically how international religious broadcasters transformed the shortage of receivers in the developing world into receptivity for American religious programs through a process of capture. Employing the user heuristic from recent STS studies, the project illustrates how capture involved a complicated, often contested, process, since missionaries relied on national listeners to operate receivers and since listeners derived their own set of meanings from radio-mediated religion. Capturing Listeners argues that the routine of everyday radio listening to missionary stations helped to legitimize evangelical religion in numerous developing countries during the postwar period, paving the way for the revival of evangelicalism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America after 1970. The current postdoctoral proposal seeks to extend work on the reception of international religious broadcasting in two directions in preparation for publication of a book manuscript. First, the project evaluates the effectiveness of missionary capture by scrutinizing a rare group of extensive listener sources found in broadcaster archives. These show how missionary audience research methods and conceptions of audiences, as well as listener reports of conversion, shifted along with changes in receiver technology and confirmed broadcaster success in reproducing evangelical experience among listeners. Second, constructing a comparative political economy of international religious broadcasting and reception during the post-WWII era, the project analyzes missionary radio alongside the religion and receiver distribution programs instituted by the Voice of America during the early Cold War period, demonstrating the flexibility of religion as a vehicle for the promotion of American values abroad as well as the constraints which reception demands posed for American broadcasters overseas prior to the advent of the transistor radio.<br/>Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact The current postdoctoral proposal possesses clear intellectual merit in several areas. First, it examines a significant area of international broadcasting that has received remarkably little attention from scholars. Second, by problematizing the question of reception as capture, the study highlights the importance of radios material infrastructure. Third, the study of missionary radio activity opens up an important channel for the influence of American culture abroad. Fourth, the study enhances understanding of the experience of selective audiences in developing countries during the historical transition to the transistor radio market. Fifth, it adds to existing scholarship on the VOA by examining areas of VOA activity not previously explored by scholars. As a cross-disciplinary study, this work will build bridges between diverse groups of scholars. It will provide perspective for policy makers in a multicultural, media-saturated society. It will enhance public understanding of the dynamic ways in which traditional religious groups seized the opportunity afforded by modern media and information networks to promote their cause."

TS3P is based on an existing, highly successful partnership between Cerritos College and California State University-Long Beach (CSULB) that prepares future elementary school teachers through a streamlined program that allows the completion of a baccalaureate degree, student teaching, and a multiple subject teaching credential in just five years. TS3P builds on this foundation by creating a secondary school teacher development program. The need for such a program is particularly acute given the recent changes in state credentialing and an increased emphasis on technological literacy, as well as the ongoing dearth of mathematics and science-qualified teachers in the high school classrooms of our high-poverty, multicultural service area. Qualified mathematics and science teachers are vital to providing expanded educational opportunities not only within the classroom, but also as a necessary element in preparing students adequately for today's technically sophisticated workplace. <br/><br/>The overall project goal is to increase the number of secondary school teachers who have single subject credentials in mathematics or the sciences. To accomplish this goal, seven objectives are being implemented: 1) recruitment; 2) curriculum development, piloting, and pathway development; 3) fieldwork; 4) mentoring; 5) counseling and advising; 6) professional development; and 7) university transfer. Evaluation activities support this project's goal of educational reform. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in its creation of a new model for secondary teacher development, one that creates a seamless educational experience for prospective high school math and science teachers transitioning from a two-year to a four-year institution without ""transfer shock."" This collaboration is developing a model of intersegmental articulation to benefit students and meet the needs for qualified math and science teachers in regional high schools. This model has broader impacts beyond merely meeting an identified regional need. Other institutions nationwide will benefit from the experience of these two institutions and will be able to adopt the model piloted in this proposed project to their own needs and own developing partnerships."

The emergence of international norms and conventions induces a great deal of conformity among states around the world. At the same time, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, nationalist sentiments and politicized ethnic mobilizations put pressure on states to be responsive to local concerns. These conflicting pressures create a difficult challenge, especially for the 15 newly created states that emerged from the former Soviet Union. Multiple methods are employed to understand the complex political processes in these newly created states. Quantitative analyses are combined with qualitative archival data to examine the parliamentary debates on citizenship legislation and the degree of exclusiveness or inclusiveness in the resulting legislation. These analyses focus on the interplay of external and internal pressures in political debate and in the implementation of citizenship and naturalization policies. <br/><br/>This research will increase understanding of the challenges confronting young states, especially in core policy domains such as citizenship and naturalization. Empirically, this dissertation research enriches our understanding of the dynamics of ethnic and political integration in multicultural post-Soviet republics on the local, regional, and international levels. These insights are valuable to policy makers and citizens committed to the promotion of democracy and political stability in this region."

France and India are both secular democracies that have been challenged by religious policy demands by Muslims, who comprise their largest minority populations. Both countries have experienced a growth in Islamization and have had episodes of violent civil conflict involving poor Muslim areas. There are two central questions: (1) How does the experience of socioeconomic dislocation shape the religiosity and politics of Muslim communities? (2) What is the relationship between the politicization of Islam and growing religiosity in civil society? Five hypotheses will be examined: (1) Islamization has grown in part as a way to preserve honor and culture in the face of discrimination and barriers to immigrant assimilation; (2) Neighborhood mosques provide an important space for social life and respite from cramped living conditions; (3) The transnational import of Salafist forms of Islam is tied to migration; (4) Stricter forms of Islam provide a moral and temporal framework for the poor; and (5) The growth of Islamization is a response to a context of state hostility, surveillance, and retrenchment. The primary methodology is participant observation at three sites in two neighborhoods in each city: Islamic schools, neighborhood mosques, and Islamic welfare associations. The ethnographic component will be supplemented by a total of 50 semi-structured interviews; media analysis of literature catering to Muslim minorities in these countries; and archival research to place findings in their historical contexts. <br/> The project will expand knowledge about the relationship between domestic conflict and transnational Islamism, an issue of heightened interest after 9/11. It will also show how the vexed relationship between minority Muslims and the state takes on religious overtones, when in fact it may be more entangled with issues of distribution in the context of poverty or attempts at multicultural recognition. It has the potential to add clarity to several debates in the social sciences, including: the relationship between class and religious movements; the nature of emerging social movements in response to globalization; theories of the public sphere; and the relationship between the state and civil society. Finally, broader impacts of the research include enhancing public understanding of underrepresented and misrepresented groups, specifically poor, religious, Muslim communities, including their diverse politics, complex forms of piety, and oft-misunderstood gender dynamics. The result will be a more refined understanding of political Islam as a growing force in global politics, but one that cannot be viewed or approached as monolithic."

CSEMS V at Cal follows a single cohort of freshman and sophomore students over a four-year period, and awards scholarships of $3125 per year to twenty-nine economically disadvantaged students, with a special emphasis on students from underrepresented groups in engineering and science. Recruitment of the Cal-CSEMS Scholars targets three groups: 1) freshmen admitted for Fall 2004 or Spring 2005, 2) freshmen participating in the MEP Summer 2004 Pre-Engineering Program, and 3) freshmen and sophomores participating in academic workshops and mathematics placement testing during Cal Summer Orientation (CalSO) offered by the Coalition for Excellence and Diversity in Mathematics, Science and Engineering. This group will include students from majors in Berkeley's College of Engineering, chemical engineering majors in the College of Chemistry, and students in the College of Letters and Science who are completing coursework to pursue (a) the computer science or mathematics majors in the College of Letters and Science or (b) a major in the College of Engineering. Students are chosen by a committee of Berkeley faculty and staff from Coalition academic support programs, which employ a comprehensive approach in evaluating each student's academic merit and professionalism. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Cal-CSEMS scholars participate in a variety of retention-related activities tied to the existing student support infrastructure of CUES, the Coalition for Excellence and Diversity in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering, the EECS Center for Undergraduate Matters and other partner programs. This includes faculty advising, academic excellence workshops, tutoring, mentoring, advising, internships in industry or research experience, and assistance with graduate school applications or job placement. A unifying theme of the CSEMS V at Cal program is increasing student retention by helping each student develop into a committed member of the engineering and academic community. Programs such as those available to the CSEMS scholars are practical ways to remove social and cultural barriers in SME fields and reinforce the value of providing educational opportunity and equity to a diverse student pool. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: There is an increasing shortfall in the number of qualified students that will be able to fill the need for computer science and engineering professionals in the workforce. Students' financial troubles are increasingly likely to interrupt and delay their degree completion. Currently, 60% of Berkeley students demonstrate some type of financial need, and are receiving need-based support in order to attend college. Financial need is perhaps a more serious impediment to timely completion of engineering degrees--the technical course load is often not compatible with long hours of outside work. Indeed, the scholarship support from the CSEMS V at Cal program may also facilitate students' ability to enrich their educational experience with activities that are not necessarily tied to financial obligations, such as undergraduate research, tutoring, and teaching. By decreasing students' loan debt upon graduation, these scholarships may also encourage students to pursue graduate degrees before entering the technical workforce."

The publication is a compelling, rich source of fascinating, timely information from which to craft this proposed documentary. Questions about the origin of the Earth and other planets, the evolution of life, the structure and processes of the planet?s interior, the dynamic nature of Earth?s surface and its climate, and the interaction of Earth?s non-living and living elements, with emphasis on improving the understanding of human interactions with the physical environment, will be adapted from the NRC publication for exploration within the documentary. The documentary?s intended primary audience are PBS viewers watching prime-time programming, and its secondary audience are young students in high school and undergraduate general science and introductory earth science classes. The filmmakers are Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia of Earth Images Foundation, award-winning producers of Earth Science documentaries for PBS broadcast and a range of educational uses. The chief scientific advisor is geologist Donald DePaolo, University of California, Berkeley, who also chaired the NRC committee that produced the report. The project advisory committee will comprise a diverse, multidisciplinary group of leading earth scientists, PBS production and outreach staff, educators, and staff from multicultural science education and professional organizations. Formative evaluation to enhance the success of project objectives will be conducted by science educator Diana Curiel.<br/><br/>The earth science research highlighted by this media project is cutting edge, multidisciplinary, and aimed at exploring deep fundamental questions that are at the root of modern science. The documentary, by adapting the important information contained in an authoritative, prestigious NRC publication into a non-technical television story for a mass audience, will provide a credible, inspiring, widely accessible source of information that raises the public?s awareness about the latest research into the origin and evolution of the Earth, and its relevance to people. This product will be timely in that the public?s attention and concern over the hazards posed by powerful Earth processes are high as a result of disastrous social impacts and intense media coverage of recent earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. The documentary will provide an authoritative context for understanding the causes of these events, and the vital role that earth science research has played in characterizing, predicting, and greatly lessening their potential threats. The broader impact will be to strengthen public support for earth science research and increase informed public participation in civic matters of resource stewardship and risk management of natural hazards, further contributing to public safety. The documentary?s depiction of a diverse group of scientists doing interesting field work in inspiring locations will generate greater interest in earth science careers among young people of diverse backgrounds, with the effect of increasing enrollments and diversity in undergraduate earth science programs and ultimately addressing the shortage of new recruits in the profession."

It is within this framework, a framework designed for success, that the components of the Comprehensive Partnerships for Minority Student Achievement (CPMSA) proposal would be implemented. A Program Designed To Achieve Excellence: Communities Committed to Children works to achieve its goals of increasing the number of students from underrepresented populations who leave the school district prepared to pursue careers or advanced studies in SMET courses. A number of coordinated, comprehensive, and innovative strategies and partnerships are offered through this CPMSA project to attain this goal. Extent Of Need For The Project: The Board of Education of Prince George's County is a multiculturally diverse school system in Maryland, located east of Washington, D.C., and serves 120,000 students. This large school system mirrors many of its urban counterparts in racial gender, and ethnic composition, as well as size. A number of initiatives have been implemented, and while the performance gap in the school system between African American and Caucasian students has been narrowed dramatically it has not been eliminated. The diversity of the school system reinforces the need for attention to systemwide reform by: (1) increasing numbers of students in science and math classes, (2) increasing student academic performance, (3) improving career and technical education training opportunities, and (4) enhancing staff development. This project strives to improve learning and teaching by providing a framework for educational reform and accountability. It promotes research, consensus building, and systemic changes needed to ensure equitable educational opportunities for all students, especially students who are economically disadvantaged, limited English proficient, and/or multiculturally diverse. ***"

Control of the quantum world stands out as a grand scientific challenge. In this realm, spectacular progress has been made on diverse, individual quantum systems. Integration and coherent coupling of multiple quantum systems in a scalable fashion, however, remains extremely challenging. In this program, we propose a collaborative efforts to tackle this challenge using a new cavity system with strong matter-light couplings. The proposed system utilizes a versatile, designable photonic-crystal mirror to control the properties of hybrid photon-exciton modes, the polaritons, in the strong-coupling regime. It builds on the recent advancement of both photonic crystal research in the engineering community and the quantum coherence research of polariton in the physics community. The hybrid cavity architecture will enable flexible control of polaritons and coupling of multiple polariton quantum systems on the same chip and thereby lay the foundation for future technologies based on collective quantum coherence, such as ultrafast and energy efficent lasers and switches, quantum circuits and interometers, and quantum simulators.<br/>Accomplishing the goal requires a concerted effort of computer-aided design and modeling of the new cavity architecture, nanofabrication of the devices, and laser and quantum optical spectroscopy of the fabricated device. These tasks will be carried out through collaboration of a US and a German team:<br/>The US team, led by the PI at the University of Michigan, specializes in experimental quantum optics, coherence spectroscopy, matter-light interaction, and design and modeling of cavity systems. The US team will lead the efforts of design, modeling, and optical measurements of the new cavity system. Students will visit the German site and will be trained by the German team on nano-fabrication of the photonic crystal mirrors.<br/>The German team is led by Dr. Alfred Forchel and Dr. Martin Kamp at the Physikalisches Institut at the Universitt Wrzburg. The German team is a world leader in semiconductor materials and devices with expertise in molecular-beam epitaxy growth and nanofabrication of III-As microcavities. The German team will perform MBE growth of the structures, and will provide facilities, training, and technical support in nano-fabrication of the photonic crystals. Members of the team will visit Michigan to participate in optical measurements.<br/>Intellectual Merit The program will develop a scalable cavity architecture for controlling collective quantum coherence of semiconductor polaritons. Polaritons are a special quantum system with robust coherence, high operating tempeartures, and a built-in matter light interface. However, control of polaritons is severely limited at present by rigid cavity structure. We will develop in this program a new cavity architecture for polaritons that uniquely allows flexible confinement, control, and coupling of individual and multiple polariton systems, while preserving the desired quantum coherence and nonlinear interactions. The new system will enable research of coupled quantum gasses on a scalable solid-state platform, and will bridge quantum phenomena and advanced optoelectronic technolgy ranging from ultrafast and energy efficent lasers and switches to circuits and simulators for quantum computing.<br/>Broader Impacts The program provides US graduate students the opportunity to be trained by the world?s leading experts on nano-science, and to work in an international, multi-culture environment. The German students will benefit similarly. These will provide invaluable experience and training for the students and prepare them as future leaders in the international science and engineering community. The shared knowledge and expertise will broadly benefit the quantum science and nanotechnology communities in both countries. The program also provides opportunities to engage undergraduate students in cutting edge research and mentoring women and minorities interested in science. Scientific advancement through the research program will be disseminated to a broad audience via international summer schools, conferences, and education and outreach activities at K-12 schools."

Recent studies emphasize importance of RNA/gene-silencing mechanisms mediated by small RNA molecules, which can trigger both transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene silencing not only in plants but also in other eukaryotes. Central to the small RNA production are proteins containing double-stranded (ds) RNA binding motif (DRM). Among eukaryotes, plants contain unique DRM-containing proteins. Carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase-like 1 (CPL1) proteins contain an N-terminal phosphatase domain and tandemly repeated C-terminal DRM domains. The primary hypothesis to be tested in this project is that a plant-specific CPL protein fine-tunes the level of gene silencing mediated by small RNA. Since CTD phosphorylation can regulate the activity of the pol II complex, our results imply that plants evolved an additional fine-tuning mechanism of gene expression, which uses components of transcription elongation for gene silencing. This project will dissect the interaction between transcription elongation machineries and gene silencing by determining roles of CPL1 in gene silencing. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to establish CPL1 structure essential for in vivo function: essential domains of CPL1 protein will be determined by genetic complementation assays using modified CPL1 genes, 2) to establish interaction between CPL1 and HYL1; the mode of CPL1-HYL1 interaction will be determined and its relationship with CPL1 function will be analyzed, 3) to determine the RNA/gene silencing mechanism of CPL1; effect of cpl1 mutation in DNA methylation, histone modifications and small RNA accumulation/action will be analyzed using molecular genetic analysis as well as transient RNAi analysis. The body of information to be generated in this project therefore will reveal novel mechanism of plant gene regulation that will also have implications in other organisms.<br/><br/>Broader impacts<br/><br/>This project will be conducted by a two-institute team consisting of two post-doctoral associates and a graduate student with support from undergraduate student(s). The participants will be trained for understanding and effective use of plant genome information and various genetic resources as well as molecular biochemical skills to validate the information. To train future scientists from diverse backgrounds, a graduate-level laboratory module for the course Physiol. Mol. Basis of Plant Stress Responses, in which students will have hands-on experience, will be taught in TAMU, some component of which will be shared in the similar course in UM. This course has been taken by numerous students in the field of field-oriented agriculture, therefore, should provide basic knowledge for sustainable agricultural practices. Undergraduate students will participate in the research program using REU supplements. An international exchange program has been initiated and is being developed with Gyeongsang Natl Univ, S. Korea, where visiting scholars and students can participate in mutual research projects. This is an excellent opportunity for students to be exposed to multi-disciplinary and multiculture research environment."

In particular it 1) studies ultrasmall mesoscopic superconductors that feature a singly, doubly, or multiply connected sample geometry as well as a destructive regime; 2) investigates mesoscopic, conventional s-wave superconductor, and/or a normal metal bordered by an unconventional, chiral p-wave superconductor; 3) explores p-wave superconductor-ferromagnetic metal-superconductor (S/F/S) Josephson junctions to understand the interplay between exchange and Cooper pairing interactions; and finally, 4) pursues integrated research and education activities. This work seeks to uncover novel physical phenomena by varying the sample topology and shrinking the sample size simultaneously, making use of recently discovered unconventional mesoscopic superconducting systems, or venturing into the fabrication and measurement of exotic p-wave S/F/S Josephson junctions for which dramatic phenomena have been predicted theoretically. Through these studies we expect to obtain new insights into sample-topology dependent mesoscopic superconductivity and unconventional superconductivity including Josephson coupling through a ferromagnetic a barrier. The unusual nature of the mesoscopic superconducting systems to be explored and the fact that they have largely been unexplored previously appear to ensure ample opportunities for new discoveries. In addition, this MWN team possesses an unusually wide range of technical expertise including ultrapure single crystal growth (by floating zone method), advanced e-beam lithography and focused ion beam nanofabrication, sophisticated structural and spectroscopic characterization (Z-contrasted transmission electron microscopy and low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy), highly specialized device fabrication (SFS Josephson junctions), and low-temperature measurements (dilution-refrigerator temperatures). On the theoretical side, our team includes specialists on computational modeling, phenomenology, and microscopic theories.<br/><br/>This research lays a foundation for using mesoscopic superconductors for future technological applications and also serves as an effective vehicle for meaningful integration of research and education aiming at providing our graduate and undergraduate students an international environment for learning and research. This program helps attract more talents from the vast pool of woman and minority students to pursue a career in physical sciences. In addition to providing our students research experience in a multi institution, multi-culture environment through student exchange and the visits of our international collaborators."

The cosmopolitan Pseudo-nitzschia sp. (Bacillariophyceae) causes harmful algal blooms in various parts of the world. Recent genome sequences of two marine diatoms revealed that bacterial genes contribute up to 5% of their genome make-up, highlighting the close association of marine diatoms with bacteria in evolutionary history. So far, few have looked at the interactions of diatoms with their epibiotic bacteria and none have studied the interactions of virus, bacteria and phytoplankton using direct experimental approach. This project investigates the physiological, biochemical, genetic and ecological interactions of algae-microbe associations in order to decipher the influences of microbes on algal bloom dynamics and toxigenesis. By incorporating methods in phylogeny, physiology, biochemistry, comparative genomics and metagenomics, the research seeks answers to the following questions: 1) What are the epiphytic bacteria associating with different species of Pseudo-nitzschia and how do they change at different stages of the bloom? 2) How do these bacteria affect the physiology of the Pseudo- nitzschia hosts and how does the algal host regulate these microbial interactions? 3) Can viruses promote a bloom by selectively lysing algicidal bacteria, while creating opportunities for growth- promoting bacteria or vice versa? This project is guided by the preliminary research on microbe- algae interaction, where significantly different epibiotic bacterial communities were found to associate with two Pseudo-nitzschia species. Bacterial associates of one Pseudo-nitzschia sp. stimulated the growth of the algal-host but acted as a pathogen on another Pseudo-nitzschia sp. This project will expand the work on epibiotic bacterial community diversity and dynamics by sampling additional species of Pseudo-nitzschia and investigating the changes in epibiotic and planktonic bacterial community structure following the initiation, peak and decline phases of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in coastal oceans. Algal host responses to epibionts association will be investigated using physiological experiments of binary and multi-culture experimental approaches. The chemical communication between algal host and epibiont bacteria will be addressed by looking at the algal exudate excretions and bacterial enzyme secretions using established LC-MS and enzyme assays. To illustrate the influences of viruses on bacterial-algal interaction, bacteriophages specific to epibiotic bacteria will be isolated and included in the physiological experiments.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project integrates education in environmental science and engineering with in-depth investigation of microbial interactions during algal bloom. The integration will be achieved through training of a minority postdoctoral fellow, broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in environmental science, early exposure of undergraduate students to environmental research, and outreach to society. The recruitment and training of minority participants in the research will be conducted in collaboration with Minority Science Program (MSP) and the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) program. Jointly with Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), undergraduate students will be recruited to participate in this project at the early stage of their study in UCI. Outreach to society and 7th-12th grades students will be accomplished in collaboration with the Newport Back Bay Science Center managed by the California Department of Fish and Game."

The workshop will be held in Cape Town, South Africa prior to the American Society for Engineering Education's 7th Annual Global Colloquium and the International Federation of Engineering Education Societies' Global Summit. Many of the workshop's participants will also be attending the ASEE and IFEES meetings and so can immediately discuss the workshop's conclusions with engineering educators from around the world.<br/><br/>Engineering is increasingly becoming a globalized profession by involving multi-national teams in engineering design, technical services, and marketing. However, the typical undergraduate engineering curriculum is often too full of required technical courses to allow time for any foreign language or study abroad courses. The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) requires eleven outcomes of all accredited U.S. engineering programs, including one that says programs must demonstrate that their students attain ""the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental and societal context."" Furthermore, the U.S. National Academy of Engineering predicts that ""the engineer of 2020 will have to understand how to adapt solutions, in an ethical way, to the constraints of developing countries."" <br/><br/>In order to become more multi-culturally sensitive, globally competent, and globally competitive, the U.S. engineering profession must provide opportunities for aspiring young engineers to learn the requisite skills and attitudes. Despite widespread accolades from students on the benefits of international initiatives, these initiatives often flounder because of lack of resources, lack of institutional support, and logistical problems. At this workshop, participants will share knowledge gained from their experience in running engineering education projects in Africa, including NSF-funded activities such as Research Experiences for Undergraduate-Sites and International Research Experience for Students projects, as well as capstone courses, and other curricular initiatives such as partnerships with the Peace Corps. The workshop participants will summarize the lessons learned, challenges, and opportunities, and so contribute to a better understanding of how to globalize American engineering education and how to effectively partner for mutual benefit with engineering educators from other nations.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by NSF's Division of Engineering Education and Centers."

Unlike most physical and psychophysical measurements, social measurements need not have objective external criteria. Therefore cultural knowledge and social norms must be inferred from the pattern of responses among respondents to test items posed by researchers. Previous research has developed a collection of formal models and methods for social measurement known as cultural consensus theory. The models bear a close relationship to models in psychometric test theory; however, unlike most applications of test theory, the researcher does not assume prior knowledge of the ""answer key"" for the test items. The theory consists of a family of knowledge aggregation models for questionnaire data that permits the simultaneous estimation of the competence or knowledge of each respondent and the consensus correct answer to each question. Models exist for particular testing formats such as true-false, multiple-choice, matching, and rank order for the case of a single homogeneous culture.<br/><br/>This research project will take cultural consensus theory to the next level by developing new models to deal with more complex response formats, and to extend the models to the multiculture case where the respondents can be partitioned into subgroups. The new models will then be applied to a set of empirical studies concerning reliable differences in the perceptual structure of color, in particular across different language groups and between different individuals within a group. State-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation methods will be developed for these new models. The advances in theory and method that will emerge from this research will improve the quality of social measurement, both for research questions related to the perceptual structure of color and for other measurement questions that depend upon aggregating the judgements of respondents."
