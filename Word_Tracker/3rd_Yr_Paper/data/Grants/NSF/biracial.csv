Despite the rapid growth of biracial people, very little is known about how biracial people are perceived and placed into social or racial groups by others. The goal of this research is to test a racial categorization model that addresses the complexities inherent in classifying racially ambiguous targets -- such as those who are biracial and bicultural. This project will identify the central attributes that guide racial categorization by identifying the social psychological processes that influence how racially ambiguous people are categorized. Across several experiments, the proposed research will (1) identify which attributes, singly or together, guide racial categorization (e.g., physical appearance, cultural practice, racial ancestry), (2) clarify the inferences drawn from such attributes (e.g., inferences of disadvantage and perceived self-identification of targets), (3) establish the unique consequences of minority categorization for diversity-related entitlements (e.g., whether people believe a biracial target should benefit from an affirmative action policies) and expectations (e.g., whether people believe a biracial target will contribute to the diversity of opinion that would enhance group performance), and (4) assess the characteristics of perceivers that moderate responses to attributes (e.g., belief in biological essentialism, perceiver gender, perceiver race). <br/><br/>This research will reveal how, why, and when racially ambiguous individuals are categorized as ethnic minorities. Moreover, the research will examine the important but often ignored outcomes of minority categorization. Such outcomes include not only drawbacks (such as being stereotyped) but also benefits (e.g., entitlements to resources via affirmative action policies) or perceptions that individuals are valuable to groups (i.e., diversity contributions). In doing so, this project will inform public policies such as institutional commitments to diversity and affirmative action regarding how best to structure those policies to address a broad array of ethnic minorities of diverse, often mixed, backgrounds."

There has been much discussion, in both academic disciplines and public forums, about the impact of mixed-race population growth on peoples' stereotypes and prejudices about racial groups, and particularly how biracially-identified individuals may challenge underlying beliefs about racial categories themselves. <br/><br/>This project will examine the impact of exposure to biracial identified, racially ambiguous individuals on White perceivers' beliefs about social categories. Using a naturalistic longitudinal study of recent arrivals to Hawaii (a largely multiracial context) and a series of laboratory experiments in the U.S. mainland, this project tests whether Whites' exposure to biracially identified individuals causes Whites to believe that society is moving away from biological, discrete views of racial categories and to subsequently decrease their personal endorsement of essentialism. Moreover, this proposal tests two seemingly contradictory consequences of essentialist belief change. On the one hand, essentialism reduction should lead to more favorable attitudes towards racial minorities and less use of social categories in judgment. On the other hand, recognizing that society has become less essentialist may increase perceptions of racial equity and racial progress and lower support for diversity policies (e.g., affirmative action). <br/><br/>By identifying the positive and negative consequences of reduced essentialism and the conditions under which reductions occur, this project will aid in identifying potential intergroup interventions that involve naturally occurring challenges to essentialism (e.g., biracial exposure) and help us understand how they operate (e.g., through changing beliefs about societal norms and expanding individuals' cognitive flexibility)."

Multiracial Americans, especially black/white biracial Americans, are also increasingly visible in the public consciousness. Multiracial Americans may have personal, social, and/or cultural motivations to identify with and project different social and racial identities. Previous research has shown that the identity choices of multiracial Americans are often reflected in social practice though elements such as personal adornment and choice of friendship networks, but few scholars have examined the effects of these identity choices on linguistic practice. <br/><br/>This dissertation project investigates racial identity through the lens of language, examining how Millennial generation men (ages 18-32) with one black parent and one white parent project their racial identities in conversations with white and black peers. Under the direction of Dr. Renee Blake, Nicole Holliday will collect conversational speech samples under varying interview conditions from members of the study group, and will perform a set of phonetic analyses on the collected samples. The analyses will focus on the stylistic variation in their use of certain suprasegmental features, such as intonation and rhythm, which appear to differ between African American English and Mainstream U.S. English. These features include the use of Fundamental Frequency (F0) range (including falsetto phonation), peak delay, and the number of pitch accents in comparable utterances. Understanding how these features work in style-shifting is important because research has demonstrated that listeners rely on linguistic information to make racial judgments about speakers and that this type of linguistic profiling has tangible consequences: individuals are often denied housing, employment, or other types of opportunities. The results of this study will shed light on how linguistic features are used to perceive and to convey an individual's racial identity."

Armed with this knowledge, campaigns exert a great deal of time and effort trying to attract media attention. For opponents of different races, media coverage plays a doubly important role--setting an election's racial tone. However, whether or not the media diffuse or promote race in bi-racial contests is unclear. The intent of this project is to explore media coverage of bi-racial congressional elections to determine which actors perpetuate or suppress candidate race and why. Broadly, this work answers two inter-related questions: 1) to what extent do the media define African American candidates by their race, covering minority candidates differently from white candidates? 2) if race is a salient dimension in media coverage of black candidates, is the press solely responsible for injecting race into the campaign, or does the media merely reflect the racial manipulation of others? The researcher will undertake content analysis of print and television coverage in bi-racial campaigns. Data to be collected include public campaign communiqu?s (e.g., advertising, press releases, direct mailings, transcripts of candidate speeches), poll data where available and accessible, and immediate post-election interviews with candidates, their campaign staffs, and reporters who covered the congressional races included in the sample. A thorough examination of how campaigns are racialized by the media and other electoral players will enhance our understanding about elections and the electability of African American candidates, as well as advance our knowledge about the campaign power of the media."

Has diversification been driven by conflict between males and females or by female selection for valuable male traits? Recent work by Shultz and colleagues on a promising model system, the eastern North American harvestmen (daddy-long-legs), has identified combinations of features that are consistent with long-term evolutionary effects of mating conflict: a reproductive arms race. The researchers hypothesize that the diversification of reproductive structures in harvestmen is a result of conflict rather than the more widely accepted mechanism of female selection. This hypothesis will be tested using a biomechanical approach to measure key physical variables in males and females of several species. Rigorous statistical and quantitative comparative methods will be used to determine whether significant differences exist between species and whether the mechanical parameters of male and female structures co-vary. If diversification is due to mating conflicts, reproductive structures should be correlated in their abilities to deliver and resist mechanical forces, but this result would not be expected if male traits evolve due to female selection. This study is a novel application of biomechanics for the explanation of an evolutionary process, as well as the use of unusually accurate quantitative data for comparative methods. Opportunities for the continued involvement of undergraduate trainees will be provided. As a biracial minority scientist, the continued research and mentoring of Co-PI Burns serves to increase diversity in science and ensures that previous investments in Co-PI Burns by the NSF will prove to be resources well-allocated."

By focusing on social relationships in an integrated neighborhood, we move beyond traditional studies of segregation research that use segregation indices, such as the dissimilarity index. Additionally, this study examines how the concept of social distance, which highlights social interaction between groups, may explain the quantity and quality of encounters between black, white, and Latino residents. This project will assess the social environment of an integrated neighborhood by documenting and questioning the attitudes, behaviors, and relationships of neighborhood residents. These data will be collected through neighborhood observations, in-depth interviews with residents, and a neighborhood-wide survey. Lastly, data will be analyzed using modified grounded theory, a process that uses data and existing theory to develop concepts and new theories (Charmaz 2006). <br/><br/>The proposed analysis addresses two major limitations of segregation research: two group comparisons (e.g. black-white) and Census data-based analyses (Ellen 1998). By studying neighborhood life in an integrated neighborhood through the proposed research design, this study highlights an element absent from cross-city comparisons: people. Furthermore, since this research is taking place in a new destination for Latino migration, it emphasizes the experience of recently migrated Latinos (Parrado and Flippen 2005). How Latino residents are incorporated and understood by their neighbors, as well as how migrants understand their own experiences inside this neighborhood are of particular interest. The recent arrival of Latin American migrants provides an opportunity to see how an area with an existing racial dynamic adjusts to the introduction of a new group (Kim 1999). <br/><br/>Additionally, Durham's population shifts from a biracial to a multi-ethnic city parallel demographic changes in other growing American cities. Studying this experience is essential to understanding the future of immigration and segregation in this country (Hirschman and Massey 2008:3). <br/><br/>Lastly, Federal programs like HOPE VI, a Public and Indian Housing program promoting mixed-income communities, follow in the tradition of sociological research on integration (US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Home and Communities; Wilson 1987) and may benefit from the proposed project's findings. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. This project will provide new and policy-relevant information on social life in an integrated neighborhood."

The answer is important for two reasons. First, knowing when and how electoral structures matter is important for minority groups wanting to increase their voice in local politics. Second, knowing when and how political institutions matter is a broader question of importance within political science. This research has two parts. The first part examines large, cross-sectional data sets. These data are used to determine the impact of local electoral structures on African-American office-holding on city council and school boards. In turn the analysis shows the impact of changes in minority representation on policy outcomes such as redistributive spending by municipalities and minority hiring by school districts. The second part of the research looks at the voting patterns of city council members in three northern and three southern cities, matched on population, over the period 1970 to 1995. These data enable the PI to more carefully explore the impact of electoral structures on policy outcomes and bi-racial coalition patterns among white and African-American council members."

The legitimacy and stability of any democracy depends, in part, on its ability to accomplish that difficult aim. The problem is especially acute in the U.S. Congress where minorities are dramatically underrepresented. State legislatures attempted to address this concern in the 1992 reapportionment process by creating 20 new districts in which a majority of the voters are African-American or Hispanic. The goal of ""empowering"" minority voters through creative redistricting is extremely controversial. Detractors ridicule the policy as affirmative action for African American politicians and worry about creating political apartheid. The issue received national attention for several weeks in the summer of 1993 as the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision that could challenge the new districts (Shaw v Reno) and Lani Guinier's nomination to the Civil Rights Commission was removed by President Clinton under pressure from Democrats who bridled at her notion of ""authentic black representation."" Minority districting also has important implications for the normative debate raging in the minority politics and women's studies literature concerning the ""politics of difference"" versus the ""politics of commonality."" A politics of commonality strives to provide equal protection of the laws without special treatment for any single group, while a politics of difference calls for proper remedies for previous discrimination and exclusion. Most political observers, including proponents and opponents of the strategy, see the creation of minority-majority districts as an embodiment of the politics of difference. This research challenges that common wisdom. The investigator's previous research shows that many of the African American politicians who were elected in the new districts embody the politics of c ommonality, rather than the politics of difference. This investigation will determine whether behavior in campaigns translates into behavior in office. Does the racially charged atmosphere of some campaigns carry over into the governing process so that some blacks do not represent white voters? Are promises to represent both white and black constituents kept by black members who were elected by biracial coalitions, or do they follow their colleagues in the Black Caucus on some issues that are racially polarizing? This research will examine roll call votes, speeches, introduction of bills, committee assignments, constituency service, and the media's coverage of black House members to explore the nature of representation in black districts. The multivariate analysis to be employed will be supplemented by interviews of members and their staff. The research will provide important new insights about the nature of representation provided to these new districts, the linkages between campaigning and governing in racial politics, and the usefulness of racial redistricting as a means of empowering minority voters."

Phase 1 consists of a 3-year longitudinal and experience-sampling study of women and men in 3 theoretically informative college contexts: (a) a large, public university (University of Illinois, Chicago), (b) a women?s college (Mills College), and (c) a polytechnic university (California State Polytechnic University). With the public university serving as an ecologically-valid comparison group, the researchers will investigate several situational cues (e.g., numerical representation, gender of professors, explicit institutional values of women and/or STEM, etc.) to identify the ones that most impact women's STEM outcomes. This work assesses critical time periods in students' college careers (years 1-3) when they appraise the cues in their new environments, decide upon a major, take major-related courses, and select career options. The data are analyzed using HLM techniques.<br/><br/>Phase 2 consists of six experimental laboratory studies that investigate the causal mechanisms by which cues affect women's STEM outcomes. In particular, they test whether the orientations that academic institutions adopt towards STEM abilities and learning moderate the extent to which situational cues affect women's STEM outcomes. Two sets of institutional orientations, drawn from the literature, are investigated: (a) fixed v. malleable lay-theories of STEM ability, and (b) competitive v. cooperative orientations. Because STEM settings are complex and likely to contain more than one situational cue, the experiments will investigate these orientations within the context of other cues known to negatively affect women in STEM (e.g., numerical under-representation, gender-segregation, and the congruence between an individual's and an institution's orientation). It is hypothesized that institutional orientations that facilitate effort and persistence while guarding against performance concerns--namely malleable (v. fixed) theories of STEM abilities and a cooperative (v. competitive) environment--will ameliorate the negative effects of under-representation and gender segregation on women's STEM outcomes. Data are analyzed using ANOVA and linear regression techniques that allow for tests of causal mechanisms. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The project offers direct examinations of how situational cues influence women's interests, aspirations, persistence, and performance in STEM. This work has potential to illuminate aspects of STEM settings that negatively influence women's STEM outcomes and provide specific, concrete, and easily adaptable strategies that can be used in STEM classrooms and to train STEM faculty and students. By providing strategies for both institutions and individuals, this work is poised to provide insight into how equitable and inviting STEM environments can be created. The findings will be actively disseminated in psychology and education journals and at national conferences. A website will also be developed to enable broader dissemination. In addition, the findings will be actively shared with STEM educators at both the high school and university levels. The project fosters the integration of research and education as undergraduate and graduate research assistants are involved at every stage. Women and members of underrepresented groups will be recruited as undergraduate and graduate research assistants."
