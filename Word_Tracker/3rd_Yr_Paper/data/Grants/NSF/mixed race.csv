It investigates how the following projects shaped local and disciplinary knowledge about race mixing and its consequences: the establishment of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology (1889); physical anthropologists' photographic and physical measurement surveys of mixed race people; mixed race family studies by sociologists at the University of Hawaii; and race relations research at the University's War Research Lab during World War II. Combining archival research in Hawaii and the continental United States, this historical study explains the importance of research in Hawaii to the development of theory and practice in the human sciences. It also illustrates how government agencies and local businesses applied knowledge about racialized territorial subjects. The history of the scientific study of race in the U.S. has focused primarily on scientists' concerns with race relations and mixing between black and white people. Incorporating Asian and indigenous people into studies of race mixing made research in Hawaii more representative of human diversity, as it made results more ambiguous and challenging to contemporary definitions of race. This dissertation research brings together the history of racial science, the history of biology, the history of the social sciences, and the history of scientific activism. Hence, this project enhances historical understandings of the role of territories in the development of ideas about the nature of race itself; and demonstrates how the territory of Hawaii served as a disciplinary laboratory where social scientists worked out how biology should influence their disciplines. The project stands to expand and deepen STS understanding of the role of race crossing knowledge in scientists' debates about scientific racism."

Dr. Yuichi Shoda of the University of Washington and his colleagues have evidence that this perception of race tends to be categorical. That is, people perceive ""race"" as White, Black, Asian, etc. but not as a continuum of variations. The issue of race has become quite salient during the 2008 U.S. Presidential elections. The Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, has been characterized by the media as both Black and as ""mixed race"" or ""multi-racial"" in that his mother is of European descent and his father is of African descent. It is possible that these portrayals and increased familiarity with Obama could potentially influence people's perception of race. Dr. Shoda and his team hypothesize that over the next four months, perceptions of racial categories may change in one of two ways: (1) people who see Obama as multiracial will further expand their racial category repertoire and shift away from black-white dichotomous categories toward a more continuous black-mixed-white continuum; and (2) people who see Obama as Black may shift their definitions of who is Black to include less Afrocentric (i.e., ""Whiter"") mixed-race individuals. Using an implicit categorization task reflecting patterns of errors in person recognition, these hypotheses will be tested, tracking the possible change in people's race perception during the 2008 election. The proposed research also provides a unique opportunity for assessing people's intuitive assumptions about race, as well as a new method for examining the processes through which people intuitively categorize other people."

She will examine the varied and shifting racial and ethnic identities of long-time residents and new immigrants in England. She will focus particularly on how those identities are related to ideas of nationality; how they compare to the official new governmental racial and ethnic category system that includes a mixed-race category; and how recent immigration, which has made Britain more racially and ethnically heterogeneous, affects understandings of what it means to be British. <br/><br/>The researcher will conduct her research in various locations, including shopping areas, pubs, coffee shops, and markets, throughout the middle-sized city of Bristol, England. Her methodologies will include participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and textual analysis. She will also interview 50 individuals to 1) understand how Britons of different racial and ethnic backgrounds understand their place within British society; 2) examine how different ethnic populations, both individually and collectively, think about notions of Britishness; and 3) examine the use and influence of race and ethnicity in the construction of British national identity.<br/><br/>This research is important because it will contribute to current theoretical and policy debates centered on issues of citizenship, race and ethnicity, and rights of belonging in a context of increasing worldwide immigration. Much of the social science research on race has been done in the United States, and this project will add a useful comparative case. It also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."

This classic question has long provoked fierce debate in cognitive science. In recent years, new insights have been brought to bear on the debate, drawing on the functional organization of the brain. The nature of this organization predicts that language should influence perception more in the right visual field (RVF) than the left visual field (LVF), because stimuli in the RVF are initially processed by the left hemisphere, the side of the brain dominant for language. A number of studies have supported this prediction, showing that people are better able to discriminate items in the RVF when they come from different categories (e.g., a dog and a cat) than from the same category (e.g., two different cats), an effect of categorical perception (CP). In contrast, it appears that perception in the LVF is much less affected, if at all, by the categories of the items. This hemispheric asymmetry, known as left-lateralized CP, has been regarded by many researchers as strong evidence for the influence of language on perception. The Fellow's previous research has challenged this interpretation, however, by demonstrating that categories without names can also produce left-lateralized CP. At the same time, several other recent studies have contested the very existence of left-lateralized CP in failing to replicate it. The Fellow's postdoctoral research seeks to reconcile this conflicting body of evidence by probing the nature of the categories that give rise to the phenomenon. Four studies examine the extent to which various kinds of categories--linguistic vs. non-linguistic, overtly learned vs. implicitly represented, coarse- vs. fine-grained, lay vs. expert--elicit left-lateralized CP. Broadly, this research clarifies the circumstances under which various means of highlighting conceptual distinctions, including but not limited to language, shape our representations of the visual world.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The idea that language influences perception, but only in half of the visual world, is an important but currently contested proposal. The findings from the Fellow's research will shed light on the nature and specificity of this influence. It may be that the simple act of forming a category, whether linguistic or otherwise, is sufficient to change how members of the category are perceived. Such a finding would suggest that knowledge need not be represented linguistically in order to exert a powerful influence on perception. Alternatively, linguistic categories may exert a stronger or more reliable influence than other kinds of conceptual distinctions, consistent with the possibility that language is privileged in the conceptual system. The findings from this research will thus provide a useful contribution to the ongoing debate on whether and to what extent language shapes thinking, with the potential to inform theories of knowledge representation and acquisition more generally.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. As a first-generation college student and a person of mixed race, the Fellow holds a deep personal commitment to broadening the participation of underrepresented minority groups in STEM fields. To this end, the Fellow has been a leader in outreach efforts to inspire talented undergraduates at minority-serving institutions to recognize the value of scientific research and the rewards of a career in science. Through his postdoctoral training, the Fellow is extending these efforts by mentoring undergraduate researchers from diverse backgrounds, initiating targeted outreach events within the UC Berkeley community and beyond, presenting the research findings to a wide range of academic and non-academic audiences, and promoting scientific discourse on the Internet. In addition, part of the research examines perception in people with expertise in highly specialized domains, engaging groups rarely considered in the research process and providing an intriguing window on perceptual diversity. Such insights may ultimately help address barriers in intergroup communication, demonstrating that when people from different groups talk past each other, it may be in part because they--quite literally--see the world differently."

During this time, the native population fell to its nadir, the Spanish and casta (mixed race) population increased dramatically, and the period of conquest and expansion was being supplanted by a period of administrative consolidation. This researcher hypothesizes that Tlaxcalans responded to these changes and adjusted their legal strategies accordingly. Consequently, by accommodating to the changing political environment, Tlaxcalans accessed new legal tools that were offered by the system and, in turn, shaped the political and demographic shifts within their community, and influenced the evolving legal system of the Spanish Empire. Building on the current literature in both Spanish and native history, two bodies of literature that rarely speak to each other, this project contributes to research that investigates native people's agency in historical processes and to literature that recasts the administration of the Spanish Empire as social phenomena. For this project, the researcher examines documents pertaining to the litigiousness of Tlaxcalans and to Spanish legal thought, which are found in archives in Mexico and Spain."
